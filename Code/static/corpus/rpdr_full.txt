- You know the law.
13 glamazons enter,
one drag superstar leaves.
Let the Thunderdome begin!
-<i> Tonight on</i><span style="bodyStyle"> RuPaul's</i>
Drag Race: Reunited!
<i>Our 13 drag warriors return</i>
<i>to battle it out...</i>
- I'm the Charlie Sheen
of drag.
Duh, winning.
-<i> Set the record straight...</i>
- I was never trying
to sabotage you.
- You could have simply rolled
some marbles out there
and just called it a day.
- Bam.
-<i> And let each other have it.</i>
- Did I talk shit?
Absolutely.
We know our names
aren't Heather,
even though they're
right here on our neck.
- If this is the face
of Booger,
I think it's sickening.
-<i> Plus, the queens turn</i>
<i>the tables on Michelle Visage.</i>
- You're a bitch, Michelle.
You bought your titties too.
-<i> And we announce</i>
<i>the fans' choice</i>
for this season's
Miss Congeniality.
<i>The drag race may be over,</i>
<i>but the real drama</i>
<i>is just getting started.</i>
- Welcome to<i> RuPaul's</i>
<i>Drag Race: Reunited!</i>
You've watched it,
they've lived it,
and now the whole family's
back together
to work it out.
Release the kraken.
These first two fierce queens
came to win, but sadly,
they were gone too soon.
Please welcome back
Venus D-Lite and Phoenix.
Pose. Now vogue.
Rising from the ashes.
The last time we saw
these two queens together,
one was head and shoulders
above the other.
Please welcome back Mimi Imfurst
and India Ferrah.
Pose.
Pose, I said.
Up next,
the belle of the ballroom.
From Hotlanta, GA,
and we call this queen Mariah.
Don't be throwing no shade.
She just wants to get paid.
- Well, hello, ladies.
- Hello.
- Hey, Ru.
- Now I've dedicated the song
you've just heard
to you and all my girls,
and it just so happens to be
the title track
off my new album,<i> Glamazon,</i>
available on iTunes.
Now speaking of glamazons,
how are you,
Miss Venus D-Lite?
- I'm great.
How are you?
- Fantastic.
It's great to see you.
- It's great to see you too.
- Now, being the first girl
to go...
- Uh-huh.
- Must really suck.
- To be honest, it's actually
been a mixed blessing
because, um,
since after the show, um,
it made people
even more interested in me
because they really did get
to see a lot of me.
- Now, it was revealed
during the show
that you had some work done
to look like Madonna.
- Yes. Uh-huh.
- Would you go further with it?
- I've had some
since I've been gone.
- Really?
- I have.
- What'd you have done?
- Um, just a little more
facial work.
Just a little here and there.
- Injections?
- Injections.
- Would you consider having
a little mini Lourdes created?
- You know what?
When Madonna fades out
and Lourdes becomes famous,
I think that's gonna be
my next solution,
and, um, I naturally
have brown eyes, so...
- Oh, really?
I naturally have
a brown eye too.
- Ooh!
- Well.
- Well, well, well.
- Now, having watched
the rest of the season at home,
which one of the challenges
would you have rocked?
- The Snatch Game.
- So can I put you on the spot
and give you
a Snatch Game question?
- Okay.
- For Madonna?
- It's my turn.
- Okay.
Dumb Dora is so dumb,
she thinks a Kardashian
is a blank.
- She thinks a Kardashian
is my next deejay boyfriend.
Deejay Kardashian.
- [laughs]
Fabulous, Madonna.
Lady Phoenix.
- Yes, Ru.
- Now, watching at home,
were you shocked
by your performance
as Lady Ta-Ta in the
drag queens from outer space?
- Well, you know, I've never
claimed to try to win an Oscar,
so, you know, I mean--
- How about a Golden Globe?
- I mean, possibly.
- NAACP Image Award?
So what did you think
when you saw yourself?
- Because I've never been in
front of the camera like this,
you know, they kept screaming
at me to cheat the camera,
cheat the camera,
and I'm like,
"What the fuck?
I don't cheat on anybody."
I'm like, "what is going on?"
So, you know, it was really
like--really confusion.
- All right.
Mimi Imfurst.
- Hey, Ru.
- In the now legendary
lip-synch for your life...
- Oh, yes.
- When you threw India
over your shoulders...
What was going through your head
at the time?
- Well, I had been doing it
in my show for ten years.
You know, I've probably picked
up over 1,000 people.
Uh, I've never dropped anyone.
It's just something I do.
Like, some girls do splits
or death drops,
and that's what I do.
The stakes there seemed so high.
It's not you're lip-synching
for Mariah Carey's
<i>Glitter</i><span style="bodyStyle"> album, you know?</i>
You're lip-synching
for your life,
and it feels like
if you fail at this, you know,
you're gonna reach over
from behind your table,
reach in your Prada purse,
and pull out a gun,
and that's the end.
- Well, thank God you didn't
have a Prada purse.
- No, no.
- How did it feel?
What was going
through your head?
- [scoffs]
Craziness.
Like, it was just so out
of the blue, like, unexpected.
I was trying to perform,
and she would just,
like, move in front of me,
and I said,
"Okay, I want the judges
to see me."
Only way that y'all could see me
was to go down to the judges,
and in a split second,
I was seeing
the whole rest of the girls
in the back of the thing,
and I didn't know
what was going on.
Get her off of me!
I said, "Okay, I'm up
on this bitch's shoulder.
Like, what just happened?"
- I understand
it was over the top,
and it--it--you know,
and people--
there were people
who thought it was
the worst thing in the world,
there are people
who thought it was entertaining.
- Right, well, I want to ask
the other queens,
do you think it was entertaining
or was it over the line?
- In a show in New York,
you know, that's--that's okay.
You know, it's fun,
it's part of--
but, you know,
this is my chance.
- I can't say that I probably
wouldn't have bopped you, girl.
- Yeah, I think that also.
- 'Cause there's no screaming,
"Get me down, honey."
I'm gonna get myself down.
- And, India, what would you
have done differently?
- Actually, there was nothing
that I could have done
differently,
'cause I think
if I was anywhere else,
she still
would have done that.
Me as an entertainer,
I was there,
performing for you all.
Like, I paid no attention
to her,
other than her blocking me.
So I think
she should have done the same,
and she should have just gave it
her all at that moment.
- I respect that,
and I totally think--
I totally think
if I was in your position,
I would feel the same way.
Just to be clear, I was never
trying to sabotage you.
Like, it was for me,
it was like,
"What can I do to shake this up?
What can I do to make it
different?"
- In lip-synch for your life,
there is a certain
sort of fairness.
You're up to perform,
and if your focus
is to just get in the way
of the other girl...
- Right.
- It's not really
that professional.
- Isn't it a competition?
- You could have simply rolled
some marbles out there
and just called it a day.
- Yeah.
- No.
- So let's move on.
- Actually, I have
a little gift for India.
- Oh.
- Oh!
- Oh, goodness.
- Is it ticking?
- Does it have bullets in it?
- It's not ticking at all.
I got India Ferrah
this lovely shirt that says,
"I got picked up
by Mimi Imfurst,
and all I got
was this lousy T-shirt!"
- All right, now, India.
- Hi.
- Were you surprised when you
sashayed away when you did?
- I thought my time
was cut short.
I think two of the challenges,
I wasn't able to show
who I was as a person
or entertainer
due to the, um, duties
that I was given
from Carmen Carrera.
- By the way,
you did say duty.
- Oh, duty.
I'm sorry, duty.
- So what do you mean?
- The workout challenge.
- Right.
- Um, with the rubber band.
We're gonna lower it down,
ladies.
One, two, three, four.
- So the rubber thingamajiggie
prevented us
from seeing
your real personality?
- Absolutely, yeah.
- [laughs]
- Like...
[both laughing]
- Really?
- Yeah.
Like, where could I go
with a rubber thingamajiggie?
- Well, if you know,
the other girl won the challenge
with the thingamajiggie.
- Yeah, with the lip gloss.
Yeah, that's very true.
I just wasn't clever enough
at that moment
to pull out a thing
of lip gloss or eat chicken.
- [laughing]
Now, I gotta say,
I'm hearing a lot
of excuses right now.
- Well, that's what I do, Ru.
- [laughing]
- I laid 'em out,
card by card.
- So had there been a challenge
about excuses,
you would have...
- Well, like, every challenge
after I got kicked off,
I would have succeeded in.
Like, I'm not even lying.
Like the cake challenge,
because I sew,
sew all my costumes
and gowns and stuff,
so I would have definitely
succeeded in that.
- You would have ate that.
- Yeah, I would have ate it up.
- Well, that's the thing.
That's the thing
about this competition.
It's almost like
a roll of the dice.
- Right.
- You've basically got to be
a jack of all trades.
- Exactly.
- Mariah aka Mariah Paris
aka Mariah Balenciaga
aka Mariah Successful.
Now, before you came here--
of course, you did balls,
uh, and the ballroom scene
down in Atlanta.
- Yes, I do balls.
- We've all done balls.
- Now, do you think
being a ballroom queen and,
uh, and not being
a nightclub girl,
uh, put you at a disadvantage
in the competition?
- Um, yeah, it did,
a little bit,
because I don't do it
every week.
The changing, the transition.
I also don't have to learn
lyrics.
- Oh, you're talking about
your lip sync now, aren't you?
- Well, yes.
That was my disadvantage.
- [laughs]
Because you saw the lip sync,
there wasn't a lot
of lip-syncing to the--
- No.
- But you--
- But I-I-I will mug
the shit out of you, though.
- She was.
- Baby.
- Plugs for days, girl.
- Okay?
I will mug the shit
out of you.
- Well, what do you do
when you don't know the lyrics?
- You know what?
I just study BeBe Zahara Benet.
- [laughs]
- You move your lips enough,
and they'll think
that you are turning it.
- [laughing]
What kind of fan mail
have you gotten?
- I've gotten
so many touching letters
about people who were inspired
by my confidence.
They know drag queens,
we go through a lot
of adverse experiences in life
and we still walk around
with our heads held high.
There was this one young girl,
she went through
a tragic experience,
and she felt the need
to reach out
and just tell me her story
and get it out.
Just the fact that me just being
who I am impacted somebody,
it was very touching.
There's no words.
- These next two queens
supersize our love of drag.
Give it up
for Miss Stacy Layne Matthews
and Miss Delta Work!
Uh-oh!
Work!
Be a lady!
- In a year of firsts,
this queen returned to take
the competition by storm.
Please welcome
Shangela Laquifa Wadley!
Ooh, child!
Hallelu!
- Now, when these two queens
lip-synched for their lives,
neither one of them
sashayed away.
Please welcome back
Carmen Carerra
and Yara Sofia.
<i>Echa pa'lante!</i>
Yo, Jersey!
Sickness.
- Well, hey, girls.
Let's kick it.
Stacy Layne Matthews.
- Hello.
- From Back Swamp,
North Carolina.
Now, how has doing<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
changed your life?
- Oh, I'm like the local,
um, Oprah Winfrey
of Back Swamp now, so...
- Really?
- I go outside, you know,
walk out my door,
and, like, my cousins,
and like, "Oh, my God, hey!
Hey, girl, oh, my God!
It's Stacy!"
I'm like, "Honey,
it's still me, honey."
- [laughs]
Do you have any beef
with any of the other queens?
- Um, when I first watched
a show,
I was pretty upset
with a lot of things
a lot of people had to say,
especially Delta.
I love her,
but there was one point
where you said I shouldn't
have been in the competition
from the beginning.
- I want to be here with people
that I think are the fiercest
in competition
so that when I win,
I can feel like I had a victory
over people who were
just as strong as me.
And I don't think
you're just as strong as me.
- You barely knew
anything about me,
and those things,
you know, really hurt
when you said that.
- I apologize if they hurt,
I really do.
Did I read?
Absolutely.
Did I talk shit?
Absolutely.
But my intention wasn't
to hurt someone's feelings.
This is a sorority
and a fraternity
at the same time.
Part of drag is sitting back
and talking shit.
"Girl, you got that big old wig
on again?"
But did I think
I was more cut out
for the competition
from the outset?
I did think so.
Obviously I was wrong,
because you were winning
before I was.
- Did you find out
anything new about yourself
that you didn't know?
- I did.
I found out that maybe I,
on some level,
I could have been more
of a "lady" like Stacy.
I mean, I could learn a lot
from Stacy.
Sometimes when I answer
people's questions,
it's probably better
to tell them
what they want to hear,
not what I really think.
Because honestly,
at the end of the day,
maybe the high road
would have been to just say,
"Yes, I think
you look beautiful.
Yes, I think you're
my fiercest competition."
Because it really--
the answer either way
wouldn't have mattered
and would have been easier
to stomach.
- Was it a positive experience
for you
or a negative experience?
- There were negative aspects,
but as a whole, it was positive.
I mean, I've been given so much
that was never promised to me.
Nothing was promised to me
from this,
and I've been able to travel.
I mean, I'm 35 years old.
I've never been to New York.
I got to go to New York
and walk red carpets,
and I just have been
afforded so much.
I'm so lucky.
- Stacy Layne, do you think
you're forever changed
from having done this show?
- Oh, Lord, yes, honey.
I've even had marriage proposals
from Africa.
- Oh.
- So I might have to take
myself up on the offer.
- Kamaru.
[laughter]
- Shangela, you're back again.
I can't seem to get rid of ya.
- I'm back, Ru.
I'm back.
- Now, how'd it feel
to be given a second chance?
- You know, I feel like I had
a lot of pressure,
I had a lot to prove,
but I really feel
like I belonged
in this competition,
and I was thrilled to be back.
- Do you feel like
you redeemed yourself?
- Well, hallelu, I hope I did.
- [laughing]
Now, you seem to be one
of the most strategic queens
that have ever been
on<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
- Well, thank you.
- Do you think it helped you
or hurt you in the end?
- I mean, top five.
I definitely feel
like it helped me.
-<i> Entertainment Weekly</i><span style="bodyStyle"> reports</i>
that you were just cast
in the new TV show
with Don Johnson.
Tell me about that.
- I recently was cast in a pilot
called<i> A Mann's World.</i>
It's being directed, created,
and written
by Michael Patrick King.
I play a male hairstylist
on the show,
so I'm really excited
about that.
But I'm also excited
about continuing Shangela.
So I'm dual pathing it,
kind of like Beyoncé
and Sasha Fierce.
- Oh, okay.
- Indeed.
- Hey, Carmen.
- Hi, Ru.
- Now, did your stepdaughter
watch the show?
- She did.
- What'd she think?
- Well, I mean, she is--
she's six years old,
so she doesn't
really get the whole,
like, competition.
She wants me to put her in drag.
She wants me to--
you know, she's like,
"I want the same eye shadow
as Carmen,"
and "I want the same lipstick
as Carmen."
She'd ask my husband, like,
"Why is Chris wearing makeup?"
And once you, you know,
answer the question,
it's like she's cool with it.
You know,
she's really smart, so...
- Yeah.
Now, were you surprised
when the judges
brought you back?
- I was.
I was really surprised
and grateful,
more than anything.
- Now, in the music challenge,
Shangela manipulated it
so that you would get reggae.
What do you think about that?
- I don't think so.
Honestly,
when it came down to it,
I was not gonna go
with country, period.
- But, Shangela,
you did have a strategy.
- With us being
the last two left,
I didn't want reggae,
so my strategy
was to make her feel
like I wanted reggae.
I set that up.
Can I have that deal
on the reggae?
I love reggae music,
like, buh, buh, buh.
Ba-da, buh, buh.
- I really like reggae.
So I'm gonna go with reggae.
- Okay.
- If there was a competitive
spirit within her,
where she didn't want me
to have what I wanted--
- Regardless of whatever
Shangela was saying,
I wasn't gonna think
in my mind, "Okay,
"well, she wants reggae,
so I'm gonna pick reggae
so I can mess her up,"
you know what I mean?
That's not the way I think.
You know, competition or not,
I don't purposely try
to sabotage anyone.
If it came down--
let's say if it was me
and, you know,
if I was in the top three,
that's a different story,
you know what I'm saying?
'Cause it's already--
you--fine.
- But how do you get to the top
three without competing?
- No, but you don't have
to throw people under the bus.
You don't have to, you know,
think like that.
You can just be the best.
You can just be the best,
and then you can win.
- Could you just push them
in front of the subway train?
- [laughs]
- No.
- Now, Shangela,
it seems like you have
a different point of view
in terms of strategizing.
Care to elaborate on that?
- Well, I think everyone
has their own--
their own objective
in this competition.
I was here, fighting to win,
because it meant a lot more
than just the check.
It meant security;
it meant being able
to provide for my family
and to pursue my dreams,
'cause that's why
I'm really here.
- Yara Sofia,<i> echa pa'lante.</i>
- Yes.
- Are you feeling
the<i> echa pa'lante</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
down in Puerto Rico?
- Of course, darling.
- You're still serving it up?
- Yes, I do.
- Yes, darling.
- Very sad
to see your elimination.
- I know.
- You gave up during
the middle of the number.
- I'm crying because there's
a lot of emotions.
I was thinking too much.
I'm so angry,
and I'm so disappointed.
During the competition,
I was, like,
holding in a lot of emotions.
Challenge after challenge
every week,
it's so challenging,
you know what I mean?
I kind of disagrees
with some of the judgment.
The judges, like, sometimes
putting other one on top of me,
like, over.
Like, "Oh, my God,
I love you,
"the way you fart,
the way you fall,
the way you walk,
the way you wear everything."
And then I was like,
"Oh, okay."
I don't think I agreed,
you know what I mean?
- Right.
Who were they praising over you
that made you feel that way?
- Well, it depends.
- Names, darling, I want names.
- Raja.
She's a great makeup artist.
And she could do a better job.
If you choose this kind of drag,
be the best.
- Do you feel that you could
have gone a little bit further?
- Where's further?
- Could you have pushed more,
<i>echa pa'lante?</i>
- Yeah, probably.
But, um, after you--
um, the judges
asked us the question, like,
"Why you deserve to be
the next drag superstar
and win 75 fucking dollars?"
- [laughs]
- Thousand.
- Yeah. [laughs]
It was a lot of pressure.
- Yeah.
- And uh, it--
probably in another moment--
- That's a perfect point,
because it does come down
to how you react in that moment.
- Yes.
- And a lot of this competition
emulates what real life is
in show business,
and sometimes,
it comes down to that moment
where I cannot go on
any further,
but somewhere,
that energy's gotta come.
- It's out of--
it's out of my hands.
- Yeah, I understand.
I understand.
All right.
Let's see what
the top three queens have to say
when<i> RuPaul's Drag Race:</i>
<i>Reunited!</i><span style="bodyStyle"> continues.</i>
Are you ready
for the final three?
First, let's welcome
a true pageant princess,
honey.
- Alexis Mateo!
- Sickening.
The jig is up.
Bam!
- Next,
a multi-talented queen
who's a real thriller.
- Manila Luzon!
Imelda Marcos!
Big Bird!
Give it.
[drumroll]
- And now, the one queen
who, week after week,
had us gagging
on her charisma,
uniqueness, nerve, and talent,
America's next drag superstar,
- The one, the only Raja.
- Pose!
Lift!
Tan, tan, tan.
- Alexis Mateo, honey.
- Hi, Ru.
Bam!
- Bam!
Is your family proud,
how well you did?
- My family has been
very supportive.
My mom became
one of my biggest fans.
It actually helped me
to understand
my family point of view
about the situation,
because I grew up in a very
Catholic, Pentecostal family.
- Ooh, child.
- And now--yes.
We have been mediating
between what was
the homosexuality
and, like, the whole drag
experience in my family.
But now they see me as an actor,
more than just a wannabe woman.
That it was the point
that I really wanted
to put across in my family.
- Yeah.
Now, this was your third
audition for the show.
- Yes.
- Uh, what do you--
how do you think
it would have turned out
had you been chosen
the first go-round?
- Oh, child, if I was chosen
the first season
or the second one,
I probably went home
the first two episodes.
- Really?
- Think about it that way.
- Exactly,
and I would have come back,
in the third one in a box.
[laughter]
- What would you say to queens
who have auditioned
in previous seasons,
like yourself,
and didn't get chosen.
- Keep trying.
When the fire is there
and when you wake up
in the morning,
that's what you want to do,
go for it.
Never, never give up.
- Now in the Life, Liberty,
and Pursuit of Style challenge,
you revealed you had
a relationship
with an active duty marine.
- Papi, I want you
to come back home, baby.
- Have you heard from him
since the show's aired?
- [laughs]
Not at all, Ru.
And I wish him the best.
I already closed that chapter
in my life.
- What would you say
if I told you
we have him backstage
right now?
[laughter]
In drag.
- In drag?
[laughs]
- Can you bring him out now?
- Yes, immediately,
please!
- We are not that kind of show.
We can't afford the airfare.
But we could afford
a DNA result,
and the result is...
[laughter]
Manila Luzon.
- Hi, Ru.
Hey, girls.
- Hey, girlfriend.
- [laughs]
- Now, let's get
into the real story here
that's been
on everybody's mind.
Your characterizations
of Asian-Americans
or just Asians in general
came under a lot of heat.
Have you heard
from groups or people
who say you were wrong
or you were right?
- When the episode
of the news challenge aired...
Klistin, "terr" us,
what's next?
I got a lot
of, um, negative feedback
saying people thought
it was offensive,
but they were always,
like, not Asian.
Comment after comment
left on my Facebook page.
"Um, I'm Asian.
"I didn't find that offensive.
I thought it was hilarious."
It's also the whole thing
of humor.
If it's not kind of--
if it doesn't push any buttons,
it's not funny.
- Now, there were a lot
of emotions
for you on this show.
Uh, your father,
did he get to see the show?
- After I got back home,
I called him up,
I sent him a letter,
and he wrote me back,
and he said,
"Okay, I understand that's--
"this is what you're doing,
but it's still
a little strange for me."
So it was just like
an open discussion
that I'm just trying
to keep, like--
let him, like,
marinate in a while.
- Did your mother
watch the show?
- My mom watches the show,
and she's always
calling me back, like,
"Oh, my God,
Carmen's so pretty."
I'm like,
"Mom, what about me?"
[laughter]
- And, Miss Raja,
how's it feel to be
America's next drag superstar?
- Surreal.
Surreal, abstract.
Sometimes invasive a little bit,
'cause there's a lot of haters
out there,
which is kind of
a new thing for me.
- Now, your win is
actually very controversial,
and, you know,
uh, some people have--
saw you as the fiercest thing
ever to walk a runway,
and other critics have said
you're just a man in a dress.
- You mean her?
I'm just kidding.
- Well, actually,
that was Alexis Mateo's quote.
[laughter]
- If it were said to me
ten years ago
and I was at a different place
in my head and in my life,
I would have been
completely offended,
and I would have told everyone
to fuck off,
but, you know,
now I'm in my early 30s.
- Uhh!
[laughter]
- My mid--mid-30s,
and you know what?
I've just come to a place
in my life
that I don't really mind
embracing the fact
that there's a masculine
and a feminine.
And why not join
the two together
and morph it into
one amazing creature, right?
- Well, it worked
for Bea Arthur.
- Absolutely.
[laughter]
- Now, you kids all have
Twitter and Facebook and all.
Do you read the comments
from the people out there?
- Um, I do,
and I don't.
On Twitter, you're only allowed
a certain amount of characters
to cuss someone out.
And on Facebook, it takes
a little bit more effort
'cause you have
to like the bitch first
and then leave her
a mean comment.
- Well, a lot of people
have said that Raja
was too, uh, experienced
for the competition.
Do you feel that way?
- As far as me being seasoned,
yes, I am seasoned.
And, yes, I have been doing it
a long time.
And, yes,
people do know who I am.
But there was nothing said that
America's next drag superstar
should be a beginner who's never
been known or seen, you know?
- Or maybe she could have been.
- She could have been,
you know?
There's still a long line
and legacy
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
still yet to happen,
I hope, you know?
And I think
there's a lot of room
for different styles,
different points of view
in drag and what--
how we perceive
our own personal art.
I think there's still
tons of room for that.
Now I want to talk
about something
that was touched on earlier.
Delta said that
we were like a sorority
and a fraternity mixed together.
And there's a lot of comments
that sometimes backstage,
we are harsh with one another.
But the truth is,
if we were in a locker room,
some of the things
that wives would hear from men--
and we are men--
could be harsh too.
We call it, what's the T?
And the T being the truth.
I want to open the floor
about that.
Now, Raja, you came under
a lot of criticism
because you could be seen
as harsh
with your backstage speak.
- It was like watching
a sports event.
You know, no one wants
to go to the soccer game
and, like, hope that
the two teams love each other.
"Oh, my God.
"I hope he gives the ball
to that guy.
Oh, my God.
I hope that he makes the goal."
Nobody does that.
There's a battle that happens.
Reading is fundamental,
and I think
it's definitely part
of drag culture,
and it's fun.
It's our way of like,
you know,
straight guys
come up to each other,
and they punch each other
on their shoulder.
That's what we're doing.
- To me, I think it's a way
of sharpening your wit
and getting quicker
and thinking quicker,
and you have to be on your game.
And it's like practicing
before a baseball game.
You have to throw
that ball hard,
and you have to do it quick,
and you have to catch it hard
and throw it right back.
- Shangela, do you agree?
- Some of the things that I saw
throughout the season,
just, they didn't sit well
with me,
and I hate to keep even
giving it attention,
but this whole
Heathers/Boogers thing,
that's ridiculous.
But if you want
to put someone down
to build yourself up,
then, you know,
that's what you have
to do for yourself.
I mean, if this is
the face of Booger,
I think it's sickening,
so ta-da.
Hell, minus the lawsuits
and the prostitutes
and the drugs
and the tiger blood,
I'm the Charlie Sheen of drag.
Duh, winning.
- Alexis,
did you feel put down
by being called a Booger?
- No, I think
it was stupid as hell.
It was hilarious to listen
to a person
believing on that
to make herself feel better.
- Honestly, 'cause I heard it,
like, three times today,
you guys were saying, "Oh, well,
we're calling you Boogers
so that we can feel better
about ourselves."
I don't think that's
what it was at all.
- Well, why did you call us
a Booger?
- Because it's not shady.
It's funny.
It's just for fun.
- To you.
- But if you take it
that personal,
that's your insecurity.
- No, baby,
it's not insecurity.
It's clockin' it how it is.
Let's get it real.
If you want to bring it,
let's do it.
- Who else didn't think
that Heathers versus Boogers
was funny or tongue-in-cheek?
- When I first started drag,
I was a Booger down.
You know,
I was a Booger for years.
- Explain what that is.
- Well, a Booger
is just a term that, in drag,
of just being, like, a busted,
like, unpolished mess.
- When you call us Boogers,
you're calling us not polished.
- A mess.
- A mess, a beginner.
- I think what--
what's happening here
is that people are taking
everything so damn literal.
It wasn't a reference point of,
you look physically
like a booger.
It was a state of mind.
And that fact was
that we're grown men.
We know our names
aren't Heather,
even though they're
right here on our necks.
We know that
that's not the case.
And we kept doing it
over and over
because it was
the audacity of that.
The audacity that
this farting Mexican man up here
in a blond wig
is really Heather.
- Why did you call
this particular group of girls
Boogers?
- Because it's extreme,
it's funny,
it's exaggerated,
as much of what drag is.
And it's not that we were being,
you know, literal,
and we're not really
putting you down.
It was just like,
at some point,
the whole idea of Heathers
and Boogers
just kind of dissipated for me
and Heathers just meant
my three little friends
that I felt safe around.
- Who would you consider
the queen of the Boogers?
- Personally, I had my most,
biggest frustrations
with Shangela,
so in my mind,
I think it would be Shangela
'cause that was my, like...
- Nemesis.
- My nemesis at the time.
- Now, Stacy, when I asked
who was offended
by the word "booger,"
you raised your hand.
What's going on?
- Just listening
to the comments,
I just felt like it was
a little bit different
than what I saw in person,
because I felt this nice,
kind people in front of me,
and then to watch it,
the behind the scenes,
and to see what people
"really" thought about me,
it was very difficult for me,
and it took a toll on me.
- What specifically?
I want to know
what specifically?
Who offended you the most?
- Raja, basically, you know,
just saying
that I shouldn't be here anyway,
I shouldn't be here at all.
The whole bullfrogs thing,
it bothered me so much.
- Looking at the episodes,
I'm like,
"Some of the things that I said
were quite harsh," you know?
And I was just kind of
blurting them out
and just being a badass
about it,
but I don't think
I really meant it
to hurt anyone's feelings.
The Heathers
and the Boogers thing
was all meant to be fun
and light,
and it still should be
sort of that,
but it really shouldn't be taken
literal,
and if I could actually
just sort of just squash it
and not really perpetuate it
any further--
I mean, I feel like Stacy
was probably
the most vulnerable
out of the group.
And apparently the things
that were said
have really hurt her,
and if I could just sort of
reach out to you,
and I don't know if it means
anything to you at all,
but I would like to present you
with my Heathers necklace,
which really means a lot to me.
Wait, just hold on.
I want you to have this, so...
- Yay, I'm a Heather.
[laughter]
- I love you.
- Aw!
- Yay.
- That's very nice.
[applause]
That's very nice.
I tell you what,
from this moment on,
there will be no more Heathers;
there will be no more Boogers.
We will all be referred to
as Hoogers.
[laughter]
- Hoogers!
- Queens, get your questions
ready for Michelle Visage,
as<i> RuPaul's Drag Race: Reunited!</i>
continues.
Now, this season,
my best squirrel friend,
Michelle Visage,
joined the judges' panel,
and the main stage
will never be the same.
Hey, Michelle.
- Hey, baby.
- [laughs]
Now, this season,
you had a chance
to bring back
one of the eliminated queens,
and you chose
Miss Carmen Carrera.
- I did.
- Now, let me ask
what's on America's mind.
Why?
- Look at her.
No, really--
- Is it because
you're from New Jersey?
- Yes,
that's exactly why, Ru.
- [laughing]
- Repping the Garden State.
No.
Billy Santino and I
felt that--
Delta came up,
Mariah came up.
We were all back and forth,
trying to figure out
who to bring back,
and in the end,
we all agreed unanimously
that Carmen
was fresh on the mind,
fresh on the lips,
and we knew
that she had more tricks
up her sleeve,
or so we thought.
- Now, Alexis, you almost
left the competition
because of comments
that you felt Michelle made
about you.
- Yeah.
I think you're a bitch,
Michelle.
[laughter]
- It's frustrating
'cause we're dealing
with so much pressure,
and, like, I mean, you think
you're killing
the hip-hop moment.
You a little came down,
and she got--
she bring you back in
120 degrees.
She's like,
"You're not giving me hip-hop.
"You're Hannah Montana,
a hooker version
of Hannah Montana."
- This is like Hannah Montana
does hip-hop.
- Hannah Montana?
- Yeah.
- And I was like,
"Really, bitch?"
-<i> Pero una pregunta.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
Okay?
Would you rather me
sit there and go,
"Oh, honey,
you're fabulous."
- Like, I'm gonna say it,
and I'm gonna say it one time.
- Okay.
- It's so easy to talk
about a drag queen,
but it's so difficult
to be one.
- Honey, I know.
- It's amazing.
It's amazing.
I mean, for me,
drag is a female illusion,
and to make comments
about a plate
that I just bought
that actually helped me
reach the point
of female illusion is stupid,
because you bought
your titties too.
- Yes, I did, absolutely.
- So it's completely--
it's completely pointless,
because that's what we are.
And then to see that I'm getting
picked in the little details,
where Raja doesn't even
wear titties, is--
- She is tonight.
She's got something going on.
- Yeah, it's complicated.
- Okay, now let me explain
where I was coming from
so you understand.
I think you are
an amazingly talented queen.
I think you're gorgeous.
With all of you,
my job was to help you
get to the next level.
Tonight, your body
looks perfect to me.
Like, I would have no critique
of this, Alexis.
I know I have my issues,
and I try to dress accordingly,
so I kind of hide those flaws.
Why would you do something
that makes you
30 pounds heavier looking
when you don't need to?
That was my only issue.
I'm just here to be as real
as I can be,
minus my boobs.
And you want to rock
a breastplate, that's fine.
I grew up in New York City,
where drag queens don't do that.
So I do get your pageant drag.
I get it.
It's not that I don't get
anybody's drags.
I know regional drags
are different.
But I just wanted to see things
switched up every now and then.
Tonight, you don't have it,
and you look beautiful.
- But I do--wearing--
I'm wearing titties.
- That's fine.
That's different.
- I love my titties,
and I work it out all the time.
- And you should.
- Bam, yes.
- Bam.
- I'm wearing a body pad, so...
[laughter]
- Now, this is an opportunity
for all the girls.
If you have something to say
to Michelle Visage,
now is your time.
- I thought you were mean.
I mean, that eyebrow
just kind of goes up,
and those cheekbones
are all up here.
When God painted
the Michelle doll,
he painted her fiercely,
so I just think you have
that look on your face.
- I was always the girl
at the club
where somebody would come up
and say,
"Why you look like that?
Why don't you smile?"
And I'd be like,
"Why don't you get away?"
- Actually, I just wanted
to commend her.
I did enjoy
the consistent judging,
and it seemed like
she wasn't temperamental,
and then I really did get
a good vibe.
There's a term called
"Stone Cold Carter"
in the ballroom scene,
and it's for those,
the mugs that don't smile.
- Uh-huh.
The judges who--
who don't give any--
- Well, her.
- Uh-huh.
- It's not every judge
had a mug.
- Well, Michelle Visage
is from the ballroom scene.
- Yes, she is,
and I definitely related to her.
- All right, now,
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> fans</i>
are the best fans
in the whole wide worldwide net.
- [laughs]
[snaps]
- So here's some questions
that you've shemail, tweeted,
or posted on our
Face-face-facebook fan page.
The first question is
from David in New Hampshire,
and it is for Mimi Imfurst.
Why do you always look
so scared?
[laughter]
[person speaks indistinctly]
- I don't know.
Do I look--
do I look so scared
all the time?
- She's painted that way.
- I'm surprised.
I think it--
probably it relates back
to during the competition.
I think I definitely had
a lot of insecurities.
- Did the competition scare you?
- I scared--
I think I scared myself
more than anything.
I--I got lost in my own world
of not trusting
that I have good ideas,
and I let it be my demise.
- All right, this next question
is for India Farrah
from Anonymous
in northwest Indiana.
Says, "I'm a 13-year-old
aspiring drag queen.
What is your biggest piece
of advice you could give?"
- Oh, wow.
- You started at 12.
- Yes, I started
at the age of 12.
- So basically you were
the Miley Cyrus of drag.
[laughter]
- Absolutely.
Luckily my brother
is gay as well,
so it was kind of easier,
and with my family
being so supportive,
that was really easy
for me to do it.
So try to feel comfortable
in your own skin.
Don't pay attention to, like,
the negative, like, comments,
the bullshit.
Let it go in one ear
and out the other.
- All right, next we have
a question for Shangela.
It's from Kayla G.
who wants to know,
"While watching the show,
did you ever get sick
of hearing yourself
say hallelu?"
[laughter]
- Actually no, because I like
to say, "I live in the lu,"
because "hallelu" is more
than just a word to me.
It's kind of the way
that I live.
It's joyous.
- It's an attitude.
- It's happy.
It's an attitude.
It's a way of life...
- Yeah, it's a way of life.
- To me, hallelu.
- Okay. Right on, right on.
Joseph G. in Los Angeles
asks,
"Carmen, have you seen J. Lo
since the taping?"
- So I've been around
Jennifer Lopez in person,
I mean, movie sets, concerts,
like...
I went to her birthday party
impersonating her.
Like, Marc asked me to come,
whatever.
No.
Mm-mm.
I usually get to see her
when she's, like, on tour
or when she's doing, like,
a movie.
If she's filming a movie,
it's like...
I can be with her
for, like, a week
because she's
at the same location.
Like, you know what I mean?
But I haven't seen her.
I'll see you soon, Jennifer.
We're gonna do a video together,
and we'll put it out there
and post it on Facebook
to clear all the rumors.
- Gorge.
All right.
Now, the next question
is for Raja,
and it is from Tommy
in Salt Lake.
"Have you heard from Tyra Banks
since your parody of her
on the Snatch Game?"
Girl, I saw you smiling
with your eyes.
What do they call that?
- Smissing.
- [laughs]
Tyra,
is there anything going on
that you want
to tell us about?
- What?
- Are you smissing too hard?
- I think I smissed so hard,
my eyes bled, girl.
- Oh, my goodness!
- Mm-mm.
Nope, haven't heard from her
at all.
But, you know, I do hear
from Miss J all the time.
He's like, "Walk back,
you fucking crazy...
blah, blah, blah,"
just all through texts.
Tyra did tweet me,
but that was when the season
first started.
- Okay.
- When the season--
She hadn't seen me
do her parody yet.
- Ooh.
- Hope she has a sense of humor.
- She does.
I know Tyra well enough,
even though we're not
the bestest friends
by any means,
but I do know her well enough
that she would have
a great sense of humor about it.
And, you know, she's funny.
She's crazy just like us.
She's a big ol' drag queen,
so she gets it...
I hope.
- [laughs]
- Now, Yara, I do have
a question for you.
It's from Michael H.
in Los Angeles.
"What did
your little person friend
think of Yara Sofia?"
- He love it.
You know what?
I haven't received,
like, a bad comment
or a bad feedback
about the little person
performance.
- Good. good.
It's been a year of
unprecedented twists and turns,
and if I could live
this season all over again,
I wouldn't change a thing.
Now, to those of you
out there watching,
don't fuck it up.
Continue to support my girls
live and in person,
on Facebook, Twitter,
and wherever fine sequins
are sold.
Now, here to announce the winner
of Miss Congeniality,
as voted by you,
the superfans,

for two
to the luxury Our Lucaya Resort
on Grand Bahama Island.
[cheers and applause]
- Yeah, baby.
- Courtesy
of AlandChuck.travel,
America's number one
gay vacation specialist.
And lucky for you,
you only have one island
over from where you live.
[laughter]
You could swim there.
Yara, what do you have to say
to your fans?
- I love you all.
Thank you, thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you,
thank you.
Mwah.
Thank you.

- My name is Delta Work.
I'm 34 years old, and I'm
from Norwalk, California.
There's gonna be a good half
the people watching
that think that a big girl
can't win this competition.
But if you can't get past that,
then you're not gonna get into
everything I have to offer.
I'm here not just to represent
the big girls.
I wanna follow in RuPaul's
footsteps.
- My name is Christopher Ulman,
also known as Carmen Carrera.
I am 25 years old
from New Jersey.
Titties, titties!
- [laughing]
- Body!
- Carmen Carrera is, like, the
flyest girl
you're gonna ever meet
in your life.
I make sure that her body is
flawless.
If you find a flaw, let me know.
- Hi!
- Hi.
- What's goin' on?
- Oh, look at your shoes.
I love them!
- Oh, those are rad.
- Fierce, honey, fierce.
My name is Phoenix.
I'm 29 years old.
I'm from Atlanta, Georgia.
Yay, craziness.
When I walk in, I want people to
be like, okay...
she could be a handful.
I can play well with others.
My mom raised me well.
But I definitely do have a
bitchy side.
- [falsetto] Hello!
- Well, hel-lo!
- Manila!
- Hi! Oh, my God, look at you!
I'm Manila Luzon.
I am a creative little kid from
the Midwest whose creativity was
too big for Minnesota.
So I moved to New York City.
- Oh, I'm so happy you're here.
I love Manila.
I know her from working
in New York.
- This is the most clothes I
have seen you ever in.
- I know.
- Always buck naked.
My drag persona Manila is my
personal muse because...
I inspire myself.
[laughs]
- Hi!
- Hi.
My name is Stacy Layne Matthews.
I'm 25 years old, and I'm from
Back Swamp, North Carolina.
I'm very much so
a country queen.
I live on a dirt road surrounded
by corn fields.
Can't get more country than
that.
- We got two of y'all tonight.
- Okay.
- Yes, honey.
- Being a plus-size queen living
in a drag community
that's so vicious--
it's so vicious--
it's built me up to be who I am.
- The weather girls are here.
- Say, word.
[door opens]
- Hello!
all: Hi!
- My name is Adam,

I'm 26 years old, and I live

Hi, baby.
Venus's female role models are
Madonna, of course,
Grace Jones, Barbra Streisand,
and Jean Harlow.
She's just a blond bombshell
ditzy bimbo.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- I'm Yara Sofia.
I'm 26.
I'm from Puerto Rico.
I'm the Puerto Rican one, so...
- So? I'm the Asian.

- From L.A., I'm Italian.
- I'm from L.A., also.
I'm black.

- Everybody knows who is
Yara Sofia in Puerto Rico.

of the party.
I mean, you cannot miss her.
A 6'2" glamazon walking through
the middle of the room with legs
like a racehorse.
- Y'all got things worked
in yet?
- No, we're just kinda waiting
around for all the girls to come
so we can judge them.
- Oh. There's more?
I've dominated and conquered
drag's face
for the past 11 years.
There's really nobody who can
touch Mariah.
- Hey, hey, hey!
all: Hi!
- How's everybody doing?
My name is Alexis Mateo.
I'm 30 years old.
Everybody's having fun?
all: Yes.
- [giggles]
- Are you from Texas?
- I'm living in Florida right
now--I'm from Puerto Rico.
- Oh, see, double down!
We got two big girls,
we got two Puerto Ricans.
- What I hate the most is that
people label you
as the Latin queen.
I'm not just a Latin queen.
When I'm in drag, I'm a star.
- Oh!
- Ooh.
Oh, my.
It's embarrassing to walk in
with a room with a whole bunch
of queens,
and you guys are wearing
the same outfit.
- I was like, oh, my gosh.
I know they are gasping
for breath right now.
- I'm India Ferrah.
I'm from Dayton, Ohio.
I'm 23 years old.
Girl, prison, honey.
I look over to Phoenix copying
my style.
So I actually had to go up to
her and,
you know, be a little cunt
to her.
I love your hair.
[laughter]
- I'm definitely wearing the
hair better, the vinyl better.
India's very, like...painted.
She's very, like,
old-school drag.
But it's cool.
It's cool to see, like,
that style of drag still
amongst us, so...
- Have we figured out who's
gonna be the bitch yet?
- Ooh!
[murmuring]
- Welcome to my party!
all: Hi!
- Oh, my gosh!
I brought cookies.
I'm Mimi Imfurst.
I'm 27,
and I'm from New York City.
How y'all doing?
I just want to start off on good
terms with all these bitches
before I start taking them down.
[laughing]
So who's the bitch here?
It's what I need to know
right away.
- You know what...I think we're
gonna appoint you.
You okay with that?
- Girl, no.
- She ain't that slick, honey,
Miss Mimi.
Before there was Mimi,
there was Mariah.
- Oh...
- Yes!
- Oh, my God.
- It's the purple people eater!
- [laughing]
Hi, ladies.
My name's Sutan,
also known as Raja.
I'm 36 years old, and I'm from
Los Angeles, California.
Raja's a model.
She's uber-stylish.
She was doing stuff that Gaga's
doing now
before Gaga even knew about it.
Yay!
- When Raja walked in,
100% pure family walked in.
- Umph, umph, umph!
I love you!
How are you?
What's your name?
- I see you lookin' at me.
[laughter]
Her look is definitely not
polished.
It's definitely not fabulous.
It almost looks as if I went
into my granny's trunk
in the attic.
- I could see the surprised look
on everyone's faces.
It was the exact the reaction
I wanted.
We're drag queens.
We're meant to be pioneers.
So why not wear a funny little
cyclops hat?
Nice to meet you.
I'm Raja.
It's a pleasure to meet you
guys.
- Club kid.
Where's her body, where's her
hair, where's her makeup?
I don't see her on the same
level as the rest of us.
[alarm whoops]
-<i> Whoo, girl!</i>
<i>You got shemail.</i>
<i>Welcome, racers.</i>
[cheers and applause]
<i>You know great things</i>
<i>come in threes--</i>
<i>The Supremes, Destiny's Child,</i>
<i>Mark Wahlberg's nipples.</i>
[laughter]
<i>Now, RuPaul's Drag Race,</i>
<i>season three, hunty, okay?</i>
- Yeah!
-<i> So you think you know what it</i>
<i>takes to become America's Next</i>
<i>Drag Superstar?</i>
<i>Well, think again!</i>
<i>Watch your back, my queens.</i>
<i>'Tis the season when anything</i>
<i>and everything can change in</i>
<i>the blink of an eye.</i>
<i>So strap in, and let's get this</i>
<i>mothertruckin' drag race</i>
<i>on the road, okay?</i>
[all whooping]
- Hello, hello, hello!
[laughing]
Wow!
Look how purdy you are!
How gorgeous!
I think I'm gonna cry!
[laughter]
Welcome to<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
I am so thrilled to be standing
here among such royalty.
You, my dears, are the fiercest
of the fierce!
- Yes!
- This is your chance to show
the world that you've got the
charisma, uniqueness, nerve,
and talent to be America's Next
Drag Superstar.
<i>The</i><span style="bodyStyle"> winner</i>
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i>
will receive a lifetime supply
of Kryolan professional makeup,
headline Logo's Drag Race Tour,
featuring cocktails perfected
by Absolut.
And America's Next Drag
Superstar will also receive...
$75,000.
- [whooping]
- $75,000!
[cheers and applause]
- Bitch...
- That's a lotta fucking money.
- You know, they say Christmas
comes but once a year.
But around here, we like to deck
the halls all year round.
I declare that it's officially
Christmastime
at<i> RuPaul's Drag Race!</i>
[cheers and applause]
- To kick off the holiday,
I have a little gift from me
to you.
Oh, pit crew!
-<i> Ooh!</i>
-<i> Ow!</i>
[laughter]
- Well, kiss that Christmas!
Baby, I was starting to get
a little sweaty.
These guys are fine.
Maybe there's something bigger
and buffer
coming out of the box.
I was ready for the third one.
It was about to be a party.
- Now, if good things come in
small packages,
then this is gonna be
re-donkulous!
- Hallelu, ladies!
- Oh, my God.
- Whoo!
- And there's Shangela.
Hallelu.
- Hallelu, hallelu!
Oh!
Merry Christmas.
Happy holidays, bitches.
[chortling]
- Everybody's face...gagged.
What the fuck?
Who invite this girl again?
She already got her moment
of glory.
She got eliminated.
- Sahara Davenport...
Shantay. You stay.
Shangela, you have only
just begun.
But I have a feeling...
we haven't seen
the last of you yet.
Now, for the first time
in<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> history,</i>
I'm giving one of my girls
a second chance.
Shangela will be joining you
in this competition.
all: Oh...
-<i> Welcome, Shangela.</i>
- It's a nice thing that
Shangela's here,
but she doesn't threaten me
in any way.
- So now that all 13 of my girls
are here...
are you ready for your close-up?
Hey, Carmen.
- Hey, hey.
- Come on, down, mami.
- What's going on?
- This is celebrity photographer
Mike Ruiz.
Mike has set up this gorgeous
Christmas winter wonderland
scenario,
and he's gonna get a few shots
of you.
- Okay.
- Today is the first challenge
of the entire race,
and it's so important
because it's the first
impression that they make.
- This is gonna be a sexy, sexy
cover of your Christmas card.
You are going to be jumping on
that trampoline to do it.
- Oh, God.
[laughing]
I'm not gonna be able to pull
this off.
I'm wearing the wrong dress
to be jumping.
This is gonna be terrible.
Wait, let me just make sure that
all my jewels are locked away.
- Well, you've got several
jewels.
- Okay, all right,
let's do this, yo!
[laughs]
- It's snowin' at the Jersey
Shore!
Blow this, Snooki.
Yes, mama.
You...
- Oh--
[laughter]
- The flying lady
on a Rolls-Royce!
- Don't worry.
We're good, we're good.
I'm sorry.
That photo shoot
was such a mess.
I was not ready for none
of that.
-<i> Okay, we got one.</i>
<i>Uno, dos, tres.</i>
<i>Gorgeous!</i>
- Uh-oh.
- Don't worry, don't worry.
I'm okay.
- Careful, Mimi.
I can see your nutcracker, hon.
- Whoo!
- [laughs]
Yeah...yeah.
Let's start again.
And hit it.
[camera shutter clicks]
Crazy. Okay.
Mimi had a really hard time
maintaining composure.
She wasn't giving us sexy.
She was giving us crazy.
- Pick your feet up.
Whoo--ooh hoo hoo!
- I'm jumping on the trampoline
with my boobs,
which are very heavy.
They weigh about 12 pounds.
I was sweating to death.
They wanted to fall off.
- I think your breasts are
throwing your balance off.
- They're throwing
my balance off.
- [grunting]
- There ya go.
- [laughs]
I was a little nervous
about this challenge.
Me being a plus-size queen
trying to jump around on a
trampoline is not cute.
-<i> You gotta jump</i>
<i>as high as you can.</i>
<i>A little bit higher, if you</i>
<i>can.</i>
<i>One, two, three.</i>
- And he keeps telling me to
jump higher, jump higher.
But my fat ass, I'm sorry...
[laughs] I can't jump that high
on a trampoline.
-<i> One, two, three!</i>
Beautiful.
Okay, do something nasty now
with that candy cane.
Ride that cane!
Beautiful.
Mariah just, like,
radiates sexuality.
- Your eggnog brings
all the boys to the yard.
Send in the clowns!
[laughter]
Hi, Raja.
- Hi, Raja!
- Come on down.
- W.T.F.?
To see a trampoline flanked
by half-nude men...
I mean, what else could
I ask for?
-<i> Gimme sexy face.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
-<i> Oh, yes!</i>
-<i> Okay. You know what I want,</i>
<i>Raja.</i>
- Oh, yes, mami!
- Raja is this beautiful,
elegant gazelle.
He really has a good sense
of his body
and how to portray it
in a photograph.
One, two, three.
- Hi.
Ooh!
Look at you guys!
What's up, dudes?
What's up, bros?
Everyone's unpacking, and I got
a chance to kind of look around
the room and see everyone
stripped down
without their makeup,
the wigs are gone,
the paddings are gone.
And I got to see these men and,
you know what?
I've gotta say some of them
are kind of cute.
Yara's kind of a cute boy.
Tattoos.
Oh, my God, kind of hottie
over there.
Oh, my god, that one--is that
even out of drag yet?
Stacy looks like a girl out
of drag.
I was like,
is that somebody's mama?
-<i> For Puerto Rico!</i>
<i>Feliz Navidad!</i>
<i>Gorgeous.</i>
- Alexis, a little Ann-Margret
she was giving me today.
And sexy face.
- Sexy face!
-<i> Gorgeous. We got it.</i>
<i>That was it.</i>
<i>Beautiful.</i>
<i>One, two, three.</i>
<i>Ooh, how phallic.</i>
Manila was actually really great
on the trampoline,
very limber and very capable.
- [gags]
[laughter]
-<i> Okay, we got it!</i>
- [gags]
- Good. And sexy!
- Oh...oh!
- Try and get off the ground
just a little bit more.
One, two, three.
Okay, and hit it.
Not so high with your hands.
Keep your hands down here.
One, two, three.
-<i> Ooh, Merry Christmas!</i>
-<i> Higher, higher!</i>
-<i> You look like a snow leopard.</i>
- Hi!
- Hey, Shangela.
- Hi, Ru!
- Good to see ya.
- Hey.
- Hi.
- One year later, and I'm in
front of Mike Ruiz again.
I have something to prove.
Get out here and turn it out.
Round two, baby.
I am ready.
- All right.
- I look forward to it.
<i>Okay, yea--</i>
<i>oh, yes, mama!</i>
Sex-ual!
<i>Christmas never looked so sexy!</i>
-<i> You have made us proud.</i>
<i>You have done your homework.</i>
- Yay! Thank you.
Whoo!
Girl, got me right on together.
When I step into that room, I
felt like I'd gone back in time.
Well, I remember the spot that
was unlucky in love for me
last season,
so let me go find a new spot.
Hallelu!
Ooh, praise him.
Ah.
Now, some of these new queens
may not be so excited that
Shangela is back
in the building.
- No, I auditioned, just like--
yeah, I auditioned
just like everyone else.
She kept asking me,
"Girl, how'd you get back?"
She seemed a little cunty
about it.
And I feel like over the last
year I've grown,
and also I wanted to come back
and compete
and really compete.
- Shangela, she says she's
gained enough experience.
All I can say, Shangela,
is prove it.
Serve it, girl.
Because you're under
the microscope now, bitch.
- She's probably one I'm gonna
have to watch my back for.
-<i> Ooh!</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
-<i> Yeah!</i>
[all whooping]
- Over here, baby.
Bring it over here.
Over here, over here.
- Hello, ladies.
Well, who are you?
[all whooping]
- Who are you people?
Now, Mike and I went over all
of your photographs.
One shot in particular really
got our jingle bells ringing.
The winner of the holiday card
photo shoot is...
Raja.
- Yes!
[cheers and applause]
To win the very first challenge
feels good,
feels like I've staked my claim
and put my little mark
on this competition.
I kinda lifted my leg
and pissed on it a little bit.
Cheers, bitches.
[applause]
- Now, tonight I expect you all
to have visions of sugar plums
dancing in your head.
Because the countdown has begun.
Tomorrow, I wanna see you in
your finest daywear drag.
And there's only one shopping
day left until it's Christmas
at<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
[cheers and applause]
[all speaking at once]
[car horns honk]
[wolf whistles]
- Being in drag in the middle
of the day's kind of weird.
It's like the circus
was in town.
[cars honking]
- I felt a little uncomfortable.
I don't do that.
I don't go out in the daytime
in drag.
- When we find out that we have
to go out during the daytime
and go shopping in drag...
I'm good, 'cause, baby,
if it's right, it's right.
[bell dings]
[overlapping chatter]
- There we are,
standing in daytime drag
in the middle of some
thrift store.
Nobody clocked me.
They thought I was Jada Pinkett
Smith up in there.
- Gather 'round, dolls.
Now, Christmas is a season
for miracles and shopping.
And today, you need to do
a little bit of both.
Using only funky old clothes
and used household materials,
you need to ho ho ho it up...
by creating your jolliest
holiday drag look.
You can use your own wigs,
shoes, and undergarments.
Plus, any holiday chotchkies
you can...
mop.
But the rest of your outfit has
to be 100% thrift store couture,
darlings.
Tomorrow you will debut your
dragtacular holiday look
on the main stage.
Now, you each have $50 and ten
minutes to shop until you drop.
Now, Raja, since you won
the photo shoot,
you get an extra $25 to spend.
- [snaps]
- Gentlemen,
start your engines...
and may the best woman win!
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
- I had to throw those shoes off
and punch it.
First thing I eyed was that big
lamp in the window.
I knew I'd have to ask, please,
can you give a bitch a bargain?
I just have to have this,
and I don't have $45.
How 'bout $22?
I'm on a budget.
- $23.
- $23! Say hallelu for me.
- Hallelu!
- Hallelu! All right!
You ask, it shall be given.
- Can I see
that gold shiny thing?
- This thing?
- Maybe this could be my skirt.
- You've worn less.
- I'm not sure how much of
an outfit I'm gonna have.
You know, it's gonna have to be
something a little sexy.
- Out of my way, girl.
- It's all ugly.
- Just like some of these
contestants.
- Now, I've shopped in enough
thrift stores in my day to know
that very rarely are you gonna
find my size on a rack.
So I'm just gonna grab
all the fabric I can find.
I need a shopping cart.
-<i> Girl...</i>
- This is the best Christmas
ever.
-<i> Oh! It's so pretty.</i>
- When we walked back
into the workroom,
we have to rush and get any
holiday fixings that we can.
It's a race.
- These ladies are no ladies.
- Don't touch my shit.
This is mine.
-<i> They are runnin' around,</i>
<i>snatching things off the wall.</i>
<i>It is a mad dash.</i>
- Oh, girl,
I found myself a skirt.
Yes!
- Oh...
- Oh, yeah.
I'm ruling this fucking school.
- I just broke my Christian Dior
sunglasses doing this.
I better win this shit.
Ugh!
- I see Shangela.
She is dragging this big-ass
styrofoam snowman
across the room.
Is she gonna wear it?
I don't know
what she's gonna do.
- You always snatching.
What is that?
I'm trying to be sister element
of surprise,
but it's hard when you got
a 5-foot snowman.
She missing a eye and a nose,
but she gonna be all right.
- Ladies, can I just say
something?
I am from Chicago!
[laughter]
- I was waiting
to see the first one
to start screaming at somebody.
I knew it was gonna be
her crazy ass.
Mimi, I think, is one of these
people that, um, really, really
wants to be center
of everything.
- Can I get an amen?
- Amen.
- Can I get
a [speaking gibberish]?
- If that's her way,
that's fine, but it's...
annoying as hell to me, so...
- [speaking gibberish]
- I don't know how I came up
with this idea, but...
it is working to my advantage.
I work great under pressure, and
I was just--I was feeling it.
I was feeling great.
[snapping]
-<i> Does anybody have any red</i>
<i>ornaments they don't want?</i>
- No, I need some too.
-<i> Okay.</i>
- Then I noticed Phoenix was
doing the same thing.
That's shady to me.
- Evidently, I'm "copying"
her amazing idea.
- You can be my friend or you
can be my enemy--
just say it to my face.
I mean, if somebody pisses me
off, I'm gonna tell 'em.
- I see the claws are comin' out
early, honey.
Whatever is in the dark
shall come to the light,
especially with regard
to this experience.
- The runway challenge is to
create a Christmas-inspired
outfit from all the things
that we got at the thrift shop.
- Honey, there was nothing
at that store my size.
I'm using bed sheets.
- Oh, right.
- Girl, if I get in this dress
and it does not fit,
I'm gonna cry.
- Ho, ho, ho, ladies.
- Hey.
- Hey, Ru.
- Shangela Laquifa Wadley.
- This is Laquifa.
Shangela Laquifa
in the Wadley family.
- I see.
- I've made a Shange-replica.
That's how I'm gonna turn it out
on that stage.
I designed this piece myself.
This is actually sewn onto
a bodice--I did that.
So hopefully, we'll all be
hitting the runway tomorrow.
- Well, that's all cute,
but we're talking about $75,000
here.
- But it's gonna work.
I feel like, I'm putting a lot
into my creation,
and I'm confident that it'll
at least go over well.
- Now, Shangela,
I have a lot of faith in you.
That's why I invited you back.
- I really appreciate it.
And I'm trying not
to disappoint you.
- All right, terrific.
- Thank you, Ru.
- Hey, Phoenix.
- Hey, Ru.
- Merry Christmas.
- You too!
- This is pretty amazing.
Now, these are--are what?
- Shattered...
- Oh, shattered glass.
- Mm-hmm. Shattered glass, yes.
- Oh, you're showing a lot
of creativity--we like that.
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you, Phoenix.
- Thank you, babe.
- Mimi Mimi Mimi Imfurst.
- Ho ho ho, Ru.
- Ho ho ho to you!
Now, I wanna talk about
this amazing...
- [laughs]
- Outfit you have here.
It's very, uh, manger couture.
Would you say you were halfway
done, 3/4 of the way done?
- [laughs] I don't know!
I'm just really nervous,
'cause I don't sew.
Throw me a script, throw me
a song to sing, I can do it.
- Well, you know, those have
been some famous last words
on<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
- I know, I know, I'm just--
I'm--I'm so nervous.
- But you know,
there are other
girls here who don't know
how to sew,
but they're gluin'
and puttin' things together...
we'll see how it plays
on the runway.
- All right.
I am nervous as hell,
because I
have a raggedy-ass dress, but I
have a big problem on my hands.
- Manila Luzon.
- Hi, Ru!
- So now, I wanna hear
about your outfit.
- So I'm gonna have like a fur
collar, and then with the extra,
I'm gonna make a muff.
- Let's talk about this!
[laughing]
You got this picture of...
- That's Sahara Davenport,
my boyfriend.
- How about that?
- Yeah, she was here last
season, so I brought this.
I have my little sketch pad.
Having my boyfriend being
Sahara,
I don't think it's gonna
have any effect on my chances
of winning this contest.
Besides, Sahara didn't win,
and I'm going to.
- All right, so I'm gonna let
you get back to work.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
Venus D-Lite.
- Ru-Ru!
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.
Chrissy kiss!
Kissy kiss!
- Now, look what you have here.
Showgirl always, aren't you?
- Yes. This was a jacket.
I took off the collar, got
ornaments, and I crushed them,
gave it a little glitzy color.
- The crushed thing here--
I saw it on a few others.
Who had it first?
- Me.
- You did.
- And the bitches stole it.
- [laughs] All right, Venus.
- All right, Ru-Ru.
- Carry on.
- Till next time.
Kissy kissies!
- [laughing]
Raja.
- Hey, Ru.
- Hello.
Well, look at this.
It's very Christmas pudding
at Vivienne Westwood's
on Boxing Day.
- You're so right!
That's exactly
what I was going for.
But I really wanted to kinda do
the idea of, like, gift wrap
and how under a Christmas tree,
it's all sort of, like,
hodgepodge and mixed up together
and a little
Christmas tree green skirt
'cause, you know,
that's where you keep all the
presents is under the tree.
Yes, ma'am!
- Well, I can't wait to see this
on the runway.
So keep working on it,
turn it out...
- Okay.
- And I'll see you later on.
Good luck.
- All right, Ru.
Thanks a lot.
- Hey, Carmen.
Wow, look, you've got your
Christmas goin' on here.
- Feeling a little spicy
this Christmas.
- Well, something tells me you
feel spicy every Christmas.
- Yes.
- And Easter...
- Uh-huh.
- And Memorial Day.
This is a lotta body showing.
Oh, she has a little booty-booty
back here.
- Yeah, this is the mistletoe
back there.
- Oh, that's the mistletoe!
I'ma let you get back to it.
I can't wait to see you
pull this off on the stage.
All right, get back to work.
- All right, thank you.
- All right.
- Stacy Layne Matthews.
- Well, hello, Ru.
- Are you having fun?
It seems like
you're the shy one.
- I'm not shy.
I'm just focused.
[both laughing]
- Now, have you been
to California before?
- No, this is my first time,
actually.
- First time in Hollywood.
- First time on a plane.
- First time on a plane.
How about--we are just changing
lives over here!
- I know!
I feel like a different person.
- But can you bring
the charisma,
uniqueness, nerve, and talents?
- I have that,
or I wouldn't be here.
[both laughing]
- Good luck.
- Thank you.
- All right.
Gather 'round, dolls.
All right, ladies.
Tomorrow, on the main stage,
we'll be spending the holidays
with our extra-special guest
judge, the one and only...
Vanessa Williams.
[cheers and applause]
- For some gays and some queens,
they've got Cher and Madonna.
But I'm a big Vanessa Williams
fan.
- 'Tis the season for giving...
so you better be serving up
some holiday realness...
or this could be
your last Christmas.
So don't fuck it up.
I'll see you on the main stage.
Bye.
all: Bye.
- [sobbing]
I fucked it up.
I don't know
what I was thinking!
I don't know how to sew and,
um...
[sniffles] I know it's
my biggest hurdle and...
I'm just a--I've worked so hard
to get here, and I'm just...
I don't wanna fail.
[sniffles]
- Is she okay?
- No.
- Girl, seriously...
come here, babe.
If you have a undergarment,
take it out,
like a full undergarment.
- I don't.
Mariah came over, and she sort
of helped me rethink everything.
- Get your undergarment.
Go get your undergarments.
You need your undergarments.
I knew she had bitten off more
than she could chew so,
you know, when she broke down,
I was like, "Oh, baby."
- What you need to do is pick
out some of your fiercest hair
and, bitch, paint
for filth tomorrow.
I feel bad for her.
I think, you know, she feels
that she's gonna have
to lip-synch for her life
tomorrow night,
and, honestly, I think so too.
- Girl, don't blow your nose
on the fabric, bitch.
- Mimi is freaked out.
Girl! Put yourself together,
darling!
- It's okay, mama.
- No, it's not.
I just have to finish
what I'm working on,
and tomorrow
when I hit the runway,
I wanna sell it like it's
a million-dollar dress.
And if I have to lip-synch,
I'll mother fucking lip-synch
my life off.
[sniffles]
- Hallelu.
- Back to work, ladies.
- We're back in the workroom
this morning, and we only have a
little bit of time to finish up
our Christmas couture.
- The vibe in the workroom felt
very much like
a Santa's workshop,
like, all the elves
were really busy.
- Okay, how come I can't even
sew a fucking jingle bell?
This is just hanging there
like a limp scrotum.
- The emotions are pretty
intense in the room.
Everyone knows that someone's
gotta go home,
and it doesn't matter how
perfect you think you are
or how bad you think
the other person is,
because there's always gonna be
an element of surprise
to these things.
- You feeling a little bit
better today, baby?
- A little bit.
- Okay.
- I had a very long night.
I didn't sleep very well,
but I just need to finish the
garment and sell it
when I go down the runway.
I'm just gonna pray
for a miracle.
- So, Venus, who do you think
is in the bottom?
- I think, um,
Mimi's going home.
Yesterday, Mimi had her
breakdown,
and today, I could just see it
all over her face.
I don't think you can be the
Next Drag Superstar
with no confidence.
- The other queens saw me
at a really vulnerable place,
so they think
that I might be weak.
Whatever.
In this business,
you have to be driven.
I don't think that there's any
drag performers
who are more driven than I am.
I think she might be a dress!
- Mimi had this idea of doing
this Virgin Mary thing.
It just looked like a laundry
bag full of, like, old sheets.
- The last time around I looked
around the room and said,
"Oh, girl, let me get this song
right, 'cause I don't wanna be
in the bottom two."
I don't wanna be lip-synching
for my life again.
It wasn't the best experience
in the world.
But this time around,
I feel really super-confident
about my outfit.
- What was it like to lip-synch
for your life last year, girl?
- Girl.
Girl, have you ever felt like
you were walking the plank
in the pirate ship, okay?
I felt like<i> Pirates</i>
<i>of the Caribbean.</i>
- The time has come...
for you to lip-synch...
for your life.
- It's funny that the phrase is
"lip-synch for your life,"
because it really feels like
you're gonna die.
No one knows that feeling
until you're there.
Being titled America's Next Drag
Superstar is a big deal.
And I'm not taking it lightly
that I'm back.
- How's your outfit comin',
Raja?
- Pretty good, actually.
I'm getting really happy
with it.
- How old are ya?
- I'm 36.
- Are you seriously?
- I started dabbling in drag
when I was 16.
In my teens, I was a pretty
awkward kid.
You know, walking down the
street, it was like, "faggot."
Drag wasn't bad.
Drag was like, "Fierce, honey!
Fabulous, girl, work,"
you know,
and that's what I needed.
As the years start to pass,
you start to, like,
look at drag differently.
- Do you love it more or...
- I love it in a different way.
- Uh-huh. Yeah.
'Cause it's always, like,
changing.
- Yeah.
And I wanna evolve constantly,
you know?
I don't ever wanna be the same
queen for the rest of my life.
- So what do you do, Venus?
- I'm a Madonna impersonator,
mainly.
- Her Madonna is fierce.
She looks just like the bitch.
- I came out at 15, and pretty
much, nobody accepted me.
And all the bullcrap that I went
through growing up,
I think it ended up
making me
a very determined
and driven person.
- Do you do anyone else
besides Madonna?
- I do a lot of characters,
but I had plastic surgery
to look more like Madonna.
[record scratch effect]
- Really? What'd you do?
- I had my cheeks done
and my chin.
- Miss Venus, you're too young,
baby, to have that much work
in your face.
That much wrong work.
- Let me see.
Where is it?
Oh...
- See?
- Is it silicone or--
- It's silicone, yeah.
- I have never had
any plastic surgery.
It's like baseball players
taking steroids.
You're sort of cheating.
- I've had this three times
and this two.
- Well, you better work
that Madonna look, grr.
- All my money and all my time
has gone into drag.
I've dedicated, devoted,
compromised my whole life to be
a drag queen,
and I think that's why I'm here.
Carmen, you always naked.
Naked.
- Sorry. I have to get ready.
- Naked.
- She has been runnin' around
the dressing room all day
completely naked.
Just naked.
I mean, is this
a sex competition,
or is this a holiday couture
competition?
- Miss Carmen,
you gotta be naked.
- Girl, I don't even see it
as naked.
I don't know what these queens
are talkin' about.
I'm sorry, you know, I feel
comfortable with my body.
For me, it's a locker room.
[tape roll stretching]
- I think this hot glue gun
gets way too hot.
It's like a lava gun right here.
- They don't call it
a warm glue gun.
- Oh, fuck.
This hurts.
- Fuck.
- I think everyone
is just really on edge.
We don't have that much time
before we have to be all up in
drag and walkin' out
on that runway.
- How you holding up?
- I wish I had more time.
- You gonna have another
breakdown, girl?
- I hope not.
- Only have a breakdown
if I'm goin' home.
Hey, guys.
Welcome to the main stage
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
Now, tonight is like a RuPaul
family Christmas special,
and it wouldn't be Christmas
without
our very own Santa Claus!
- Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!
[laughter]
- The funniest man on earth,
Bruce Vilanch.
Hi, Bruce.
- Hi, Ru.
- We are so glad you're here.
- It's tough for a Jewish boy
to do this.
- I know.
I know.
But in this economy,
you'll take it where you can.
- Exactly. I'm up-sizing.
[laughter]
- Santino!
- Hey, Ru.
- Hello, my dear.
- Shall we dance?
- Let's.
- [laughs]
- And the return of Michelle
Visage,
my cohost for over 100 episodes
of the<i> RuPaul</i><span style="bodyStyle"> talk show.</i>
- Couldn't keep us apart.
- [laughs]
And Mike Ruiz.
- Yes!
- We've just gotta stop
meeting like this.
- I know!
- Prissy kissness.
And I saved the best for last.
[laughter]
The lovely and talented
Vanessa Williams is here!
- Darling, you look phenomenal.
- Thank you so much.
I see you glittering
over there too.
- Thank you.
Got some gifts for Santa.
- Yes!
- Thank you!
[laughter]
- This week, our queens were
challenged to make their best
holiday drag looks
using thrift store hand-me-downs
and Christmas decorations.
Gentlemen...start your engines.
And may the best woman win!
Carmen Carrera.
- Hey, hey.
- Look at the size of that box!
-<i> My lips are done,</i>
<i>my hair is done.</i>
<i>I'm feeling hot right now.</i>
<i>The spotlight is on me.</i>
<i>You can see my cheeks from</i>
<i>across the street.</i>
- Uh-uh!
- Oh, the mistletoe.
- Is that mistletoe
or cameltoe?
- Look at that body. Ah!
- Manila Luzon.
- Look at the size
of that muff!
- Both hands fit.
-<i> I am living on the runway.</i>
<i>I'm having so much fun.</i>
<i>The snow is coming, and</i>
<i>I'm just struttin' my stuff.</i>
- A desperate housewife
of the North Pole.
- All right!
- He's giving us
Janice Dickinson.
- It's Yara Sofia,
and she's had her nose fixed!
- What a fabulous
set of antlers.
-<i> I was so nervous,</i>
<i>but I feel great.</i>
<i>I did a good job,</i>
<i>and I give them a surprise.</i>
- Hey!
[chuckles]
- Incredible.
- I love it!
- Oh, who do we have here?
That's Phoenix?
Ahoy!
-<i> I think it was definitely</i>
<i>the best Christmas couture</i>
<i>that I could give.</i>
<i>I think my shit's fierce.</i>
<i>I think I could win.</i>
- Oh, holy night,
that skirt is short.
- I can see her figgy pudding!
- Stacy Layne Matthews.
Representin' Back Swamp,
North Carolina.
-<i> I think it's time</i>
<i>for a plus-size queen.</i>
<i>The skinny girls try</i>
<i>to take over,</i>
<i>so I think it's time</i>
<i>for us big girls to step up.</i>
- Now, that's
the<i> Jingle Bell Rock.</i>
Oh, it's Venus D-Lite!
Merry Christmas.
-<i> I'm just really trying to be</i>
<i>fun and sassy, little flirty.</i>
<i>I'm being me.</i>
- Oh, lick it.
That looks delicious.
- Somebody's gonna get caned.
- India Ferrah.
- Okay, now.
Look at those two treats.
- Santa, would you like some
milk to go with those cookies?
-<i> I'm looking good, bitch.</i>
<i>My hair is done, makeup right,</i>
<i>and I'm just walking</i>
<i>down the runway,</i>
<i>knowing that I look sickening.</i>
- Ooh, the Fahrenheit
is getting higher!
- Delta Work.
And she is giving us
a Kwanzaa celebration.
-<i> As soon as I hit the runway,</i>
<i>I am just--I'm so excited.</i>
<i>It's exhilarating.</i>
<i>It's what I've been waiting</i>
<i>for.</i>
<i>And I'm feeling really good</i>
<i>giving Kwanzaa realness.</i>
- Erykah Badu!
Leontyne Price.
[laughter]
From Puerto Rico...
Alexis.
- Ooh!
- [trilling]
-<i> Feliz Navidad.</i>
Cha, cha, cha!
-<i> I'm feeling fabulous.</i>
<i>The light, the music,</i>
<i>adrenaline comin' through.</i>
<i>I'm just feeling</i>
<i>on the top of the world.</i>
- Oh!
Oh, yes! Okay.
El Barbizono modeling school-o.
- Love the snowflake earrings.
- Next, Mimi Imfurst.
- Oh, little baby Jesus
in her hands?
- Oh, yes,
it's the Madonna!
- It is!
It's the mother.
- Oh, wait a minute, that's--
that's actually a ham
in her arms.
-<i> I hit the runway,</i>
<i>and I just decide in my mind</i>
<i>that I'm going</i>
<i>to deliver this dress</i>
<i>and deliver the character.</i>
- I wanna see baby Jesus.
- I know--is he asleep
right now?
- He's cooking at 350!
- Hotlanta's own,
Mariah.
- In Christmas gray.
- Oh, she's giving a little
Wilhelmina Slater, I'd say.
- Yes, she is!
-<i> I'm not polished as well</i>
<i>as I know I can be,</i>
<i>but I'm not gonna</i>
<i>let the judges see that.</i>
<i>I'm never gonna let them</i>
<i>see me sweat.</i>
- Silver bells!
- Couture Christmas.
- Karl Lagerfeld,
eat your heart out.
Up next is Raja!
Oh, no stranger to the runway.
- Look at the detail
on that skirt.
- Vivienne Westwood!
What?
-<i> Once I get out there,</i>
<i>I feel awesome.</i>
<i>That's my thing.</i>
<i>I am a runway girl.</i>
<i>I am a photography girl.</i>
<i>I'm a model.</i>
- I just can't take my eyes
off of her.
- Gorgeous!
- Yes! Snow angels!
- Was it snow angels or a fit?
[laughter]
- Shangela Laquifa Wadley.
Oh, she's gained weight!
Oh, there she is.
- She made a snowman.
- She's a little frosty.
Oh, and she's got her piece
of corn there.
- All right!
- It's become a tradition here.
Oh, and her skirts light up!
Where is she keeping
the batteries?
-<i> I am feeling so confident.</i>
<i>I love my outfit,</i>
<i>and all I can think is,</i>
<i>"Shangela, work, bitch."</i>
- You know what I say.
Never work with animals,
children, or snowmen.
Welcome, ladies.
Based on your Christmas drag,
your holiday card photo shoot,
and your presentation
on the main stage,
I've made some decisions.
Will the following queens
please step forward?
Mariah.
Delta Work.
Yara Sofia.
India Ferrah.
Phoenix.
Stacy Layne Matthews.
Alexis Mateo.
The seven of you
all stood out...
for not standing out
from the crowd.
You are all safe
from elimination.
But I warn you.
In this competition,
with $75,000 at stake...
"Safe" is a dirty word.
You may leave the stage.
All right, ladies...
you six are the nicest and
the naughtiest of the week.
It is time
for the judges' critiques.
Let's start with Carmen Carrera.
- Well, I think Carmen
used her assets to a T.
- Yes, ma'am!
- All I can think of is bows,
bows, booty.
You used what your maker gave to
you, and you brought the sexy.
- From one Jersey girl to
another, Carmen, you're hot.
You know you're hot.
Here's my one concern:
don't rely on body all the time.
- Y'all, I'd like to hear
from Santa, Bruce Vilanch.
- I'm very concerned
about the mistletoe,
because I think it's bad when
anything takes root there.
[laughter]
- Thank you, Bruce.
Let's take a look
at your holiday photo.
- You didn't really get into,
like, the dancer-ly beauty
of what I was asking
of you guys.
- I've never done
the trampoline before,
and getting on it,
I pulled a muscle.
So I wasn't really ready for
this, and it was kind of like,
the hair wasn't really working
with the--what I had on my arm,
which was getting caught
to the chiffon.
And then my lip gloss was stuck,
you know, and I swallowed
a piece of snow and...
- There's a lot of excuses.
You know, this is a competition.
At the end of the day,
nobody gives a crap.
You just have to bring it.
- Next up, Manila Luzon.
- Being from New York,
you reminded me of a Rockette.
And the second thing was
Marie Osmond, for some reason.
It's very Marie Osmond,
isn't it?
- She has really big hair
these days.
- But very well put together.
- Thank you.
- You are a magical,
fantastical confection.
- Well, this is the second dress
that I've ever sewn in my life.
- Wow. It's great.
It looks like Louis Vuitton.
- Oh!
- I thought more La Toya
Vuitton.
[laughter]
Shangela Laquifa Wadley.
Where'd you get the idea to use
a big prop like that?
- Oh, you talking about
Frostula?
Frostula the Snow Ho.
And if she came to life,
it would be Shangela.
- You kind of have a mild
concept going,
but it's still very kind
of remedial.
The execution is poor.
The back, it's kind
of falling apart.
There just could have been
more attention to detail.
- Now, I did learn to sew.
However, it was a little
difficult in working
with a paper material.
That was new for me.
- Here's the thing--you bring
out a big giant snowman.
The snowman was bigger
than the payoff.
And the thing about props--
you never wanna be upstaged
by a papier-mache snowman,
you know what I'm saying?
You don't!
- Well, I tell you,
on that note,
let's take a look
at your photograph
and see how well you did.
- I see a lot of armpit.
That's the first thing I went
to,
it was like--
armpit, you know.
- But it's fresh.
[laughter]
- All right, Shangela,
thank you very much.
Next up, Venus D-Lite.
How'd it feel for you up
on the runway?
- I was just having a ball.
- Can you turn around
and show me your ponytail?
That is really, I think,
the best part of your outfit.
I think the rest of the outfit
is overdone.
What did Coco Chanel say?
"Before you leave the house,
take one thing off"?
You've got the snowflake
and the beaded shoes
and then the beaded lapel.
I mean, it's a lot goin' on.
- Of the fabrications you
selected,
the whole mix isn't really
working for me.
You look like
a sad Christmas elf.
- The choices that I had
to make an outfit--
it was very limited.
And I'm saving the best
for later.
- Well, Venus, as you know,
in this competition,
with $75,000 at stake,
everything you do counts.
So that's not really an excuse.
Next, Mimi Imfurst.
You've got such a big heart.
- Thank you!
[laughter]
I've got a big everything, girl.
I actually only weigh 98 pounds.
The rest of this is liver.
- Ah!
[laughter]
- It's really a twist on
something that
is very religious,
and you are making it delightful
and campy
and really putting a spin on it.
- You have a great concept.
There's a amateurish quality
about it, but I love it.
I think it all works.
- Santa Claus,
meet the Virgin Mary.
- I think you're show business.
You're what it's about.
And you had a concept,
and you had an execution,
and you've been carrying
that baby longer
than Rose Kennedy
carried 12 children.
[laughter]
- I'm kind of surprised,
in some ways,
that you have
said such kind words.
You guys have sort
of renewed my faith today
in doing what you trust
in your heart.
- Thank you, Mimi.
Raja, you won
the photo challenge.
- Wow.
- Yeah.
- Flawless.
- It's obvious to me
you have incredible style.
You work this runway
like a supermodel.
- And you're not taking yourself
too seriously,
which kind of embodies, like,
the whole well-rounded,
like, drag superstar kind
of thing that we're going for.
- For me, it's what, like,
drag artistry is all about.
It's just doing something
unexpected
and creating it out of nothing.
- This is what I do, you know?
I'm a runway girl, I'm a model.
I'm<i> Supermodel of the World,</i>
the sequel,
I'd like to say.
[laughter]
- The only thing that I might
suggest is
that you project a little more
in your voice.
- I mean, I can certainly
speak louder,
but she's making me nervous,
so...
[giggles]
- Thank you, ladies.
Thank you, Bruce.
While you enjoy an Absolut
cocktail
in the Interior Illusions
Lounge,
the judges
and I will deliberate.
You may leave the stage.
Just between us "goils,"
what do you think?
Let's start with Carmen.
- Carmen brought bo-dy.
I'm still mesmerized
how she tucked all that stuff--
I don't know
where the heck it went,
but it was an amazing tuck.
The one thing I thought might
have lacked was her personality.
- Although, I'm sort of a sucker
for that "Joisey,"
you know, thing like dat,
you know.
- I wanted more Jersey.
I have no idea who Carmen is,
at this point, but a body.
- What about Manila Luzon?
- I think she is gorgeous.
She really embodied the spirit
of a winter wonderland.
- The only thing I might say is
she's funny and engaging
for a cocktail party
but not really
in an entertainment,
kind of showbiz-y kinda way.
- Right.
- Shangela Laquifa Wadley.
- I did think that her outfit
looked a little unfinished.
She could have done better.
- She kind of flubbed it.
- I don't know if Shangela
has the consistency
to make it further
in this competition.
- The personality supersedes
her tailoring skills.
I really wanna see some other
side of Shangela,
and it would be unfortunate
to send her home now.
- Venus D-Lite.
- She was a sad extra in some
kind of, you know, bad--
-<i> It's a Horrible Life.</i>
[laughter]
Her face is beautiful, but you
can't come out on the challenge
and the ponytail be the
highlight of your ensemble.
- That's true.
- Even though the outfit and
everything was very amateurish,
I was hoping she'd redeem
herself with her personality.
But she was inarticulate
and just wasn't engaging.
- Mimi Imfurst!
Her outfit was a little sloppy,
but it was effective.
- I thought it was hilarious
that she used something that's
so iconic and turned it into
something that was flirty
and funny.
- You know I live for camp drag,
but I'm really concerned that
that's her shtick
and that's what she falls on.
I wanna see if she can do
something else.
- Raja.
How 'bout that?
- She brings couture
and a sense of ownership
as soon as she stepped out
on the runway.
- Yes.
- And then the delight was
watching her drop to the ground
and being fun.
And that was
a great combination.
- I did wish she would project
her voice a little more
and kind of be a little more
in your face.
- Right, you not just look like
a supermodel...
- Act like one.
- Silence!
Bring back my girls.
Welcome back, ladies.
Let's get down to it.
Mimi Imfurst.
You showed us
that big girls do cry.
Now I'm really gonna give you
something to cry about.
Condragulatons.
You're safe.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
I just couldn't believe it.
I was for sure I was
in the bottom two.
I was for sure.
- Manila Luzon.
You have a muff to die for.
You're safe.
Condragulations.
Venus...
you were outshined
on the runway.
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
- When Ru said I was
in the bottom two, I was...
I was devastated.
- Raja.
With your photo, fashion,
and frolic in the snow...
you are the queen
who stole Christmas.
Condragulations.
You are the winner
of this challenge.
[applause]
And Raja, you receive immunity
from elimination next week.
Plus, you'll receive a $2,000
gift certificate from
SequinQueen.com.
That's SequinQueen.com.
- I'm so proud of myself.
I worked really hard, and
I was really focused about this.
And it feels really great.
- Carmen Carrera, you have
the body of death...
but do you have the killer
instinct it takes to win?
Shangela, I've given you
a second chance,
but your holiday presentation
left us a little frosty.
Carmen, you're safe.
- Thank you.
- Shangela, my dear,
you are up for elimination.
- I'm in disbelief.
A year later,
and here I am again,
in the bottom two.
- Two queens stand before me.
Prior to tonight,
you were asked
to prepare a lip-sync
performance
of Vanessa Williams'<i> </i>
<i>The Right Stuff.</i>
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me
to save yourself
from elimination.
The time has come for you
to lip-synch...
for your life!
Good luck, and don't...
fuck it up.
[telephone rings]
-<i> I really wanna be here.</i>
<i>I'm determined to fight</i>
<i>to be here.</i>
- Venus gets physical.
But you know what?
Even when pushed,
you can't stop me.
- Miss Venus throws her ponytail
to the back of the stage.
If she would have hit me
with that hair,
I probably would have
had to sock her.
- The lip-synching is starting
to get a little violent.
- Shangela's lamp shade
has become a weapon.
- Shangela's doing what
she's supposed to be doing.
She's supposed to be
lip-synching and performing,
and Venus is just really
pouncing on her.
[cheers and applause]
- Wow.
- Ladies...
I must admit, that
made me feel uncomfortable.
I expect my queens to...
outshine each other,
not outgun each other.
But I have made my decision.
Shangela...
Shantay. You stay.
- Thank you.
Thank you very much.
[sniffling]
[crying]
- Venus D-Lite...
tonight you may be leaving
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race ...</i>
but you're returning
to the constellation
of great drag stars.
Shine on, Venus, shine on.
Now, sashay away.
- Thank you for this wonderful
experience
from the bottom of my heart.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I'm happy, I'm sad,
I'm pissed off.
I think I should still be here.
I think I had a lot more
to bring to the table.
And I don't think I was given
that opportunity.
- Ladies,
now, this competition has raised
the bar on drag worldwide.
There's only one way to go,
and that's up.
So take me higher.
And remember,
if you can't love yourself,
how in the hell are you gonna
love somebody else?
Can I get an amen in here?
all: Amen.
- Let the music play.
<i>Grand prize contributed</i>

It's Christmastime

[cheers and applause]
[dramatic music]
- Hallelu, ladies!
[people cheering]
- What the fuck?
- Hi!
- I don't know
what I was thinking.
And if I have to lip synch,
I'll motherfucking lip-sync
my life off.
- Oh, it's Venus D-Lite.
Mimi Imfurst.
Shangela.
Raja.
Condragulations.
You are the winner
of this challenge.
[applause]
Two queens stand before me.
- I'm in disbelief.
A year later,
and here I am again
in the bottom two.
- Shangela, shantay, you stay.
Venus D-Lite, sashay away.
- Thank you.
- And tonight...
are you ready to have
some psychic fun?
The dolls gaze into the future.
- And it's out of this world.
Prepare to gag on my eleganza.
- With extra special
guest judges
<i>Caprica's</i><span style="bodyStyle"> Alessandra Torresani</i>
and the legendary Lily Tomlin.
The winner of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i>

And may the best woman win.
[tires screech]
- Oh.
- Here we go, ladies.
- Oh, hallelujah.
No more snow.
- Oh, thank god.
- Oh, she left a message.
- "Don't be shady.
Be a lady."
- We had our first elimination.
I see Venus' message
on the mirror,
and it's just a finalization
that one of my sisters from home
is now gone,
and I'm feeling
completely vulnerable.
- I've never done this before,
'cause I was the first one to go
last time.
It's what happens
when you push Shangela.
[laughter]
I survived.
But I don't even feel like
the same Shangela.
I'm battered, bruised.
My spirit is beat down.
- Well, glad you're still here,
Curly.
- Oh, thank you.
- Just stay here longer,
and don't wear none of them
crazy-ass outfits.
- Okay, well...
Manila's coming over
to talk to me,
and all I hear really is,
"Blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."
I just don't want to be
bothered.
- I know you have some cute
drag up in here, so...
- I do.
I actually do have a lot
of good stuff in here.
- Do you think Venus
should have gone home?
- Yes.
It's all about a line of
professionalism.
You know, we all want this,
like, really bad,
but you guys will never have to
deal with that with me.
The competition part
has really kicked in.
You're like, "People really do
go home."
Everything we've worked for
and wanted for so long
is over like that.
- Venus is gone.
The jig is up.
Let's see what's next.
I'm pushing myself 100% forward
and harder to stay here.
I think Shangela, she need to be
very careful,
'cause the queens in this season
are really fierce,
including me first.
- If I was to go home at that
moment, I would have...
[sighs]
[siren wails]
- Ooh, girl!
You've got she-mail.
Drag, the final frontier.
These are the voyages
of the starship<i> Drag Race,</i>
a one-year mission
to boldly tuck
where no man has tucked before.
[men exclaiming]
Set a corset for warp speed,
because this mothership is
about to blast off.
[laughter]
Hello, hello, hello, hello.
[cheers and applause]
Look at you all.
For today's mini challenge,
I'm looking for two ladies
with a little something extra.
I'm talking about ESP,
extrasensory perception.
I need you to pair up
with the queen
you feel the strongest
psychic connection with.
The one team that gets the most
correct matches wins.
Raja, you'll be giving
mental vibrations,
and, Delta, you'll be receiving.
- Delta and I are very
psychically connected,
or at least I hope we are,
because Delta knows a lot
about me.
Delta knows how many cab drivers
I've slept with.
Delta knows all kinds of shit.
- Delta, what wig
is Raja wearing?
- It's brunette.
- What color ring?
- The white diamond.
- The white diamond.
Last question.
What color is the pussycat?
[cat meows]
- Pink.
- So, Phoenix, what color boa
is Mariah wearing?
- Day-Glo green.
- What color is the pussycat?
- This is definitely
a black pussycat.
- I don't know where she got the
lime green boa from,
but everybody needs a black
pussycat in their life.
- All right, Carmen,
please send it hard.
[whip cracks]
Ow--ow.
Oh, okay.
Girl's wearing a purple boa.
- Okay.
Stacy Layne Matthews,
what color pussycat?
- I'll say a pink pussycat.
- I'm gonna say pink.
- Okay, a pink wig.
- Yes.
- All right.
- Let me find it.
Let me find it.
- Find it, honey.
- It's coming through.
It's coming through.
And she's wearing the green one.
- The green one.
- Yes.
- All right.
Now, I've tested your ESP.
And the winning team
is Phoenix and Mariah.
[cheers and applause]
How about that?
The next drag superstar
has to prove
that her charisma, uniqueness,
nerve, and talent
is truly out of this world.
Now, for today's main challenge,
you'll be shooting scenes for
the new sci-fi movie saga...
[voice echoing]
<i>Drag Queens in Outer Space.</i>
You'll be splitting up
into two teams.
Phoenix and Mariah, together
you won the mini challenge,
but now you are
competing captains.
men: Ooh!
- I see Phoenix,
she's my rival now,
and I think I'm gonna
wear her out.
- I definitely have leadership
experience.
I could totally win
this competition, yeah.
- Now, Phoenix,
go ahead and choose
the first member of your team.
- Raja.
- Mariah.
- Arianna.
- Delta.
- Alexis.
- Ooh!
- They all fools, 'cause I have
an acting company.
So their loss
if they don't pick me.
- India.
- Shangela.
- Manila.
- High-five, team.
- Stacy.
Of course had to get with
big girl Miss Stacy, honey.
- Phoenix, two are left,
Carmen and Mimi.
Who are you choosing?
- Carmen.
- Carmen's coming on over,
which of course means that Mimi
is going to Mariah's side.
- By not picking me, the other
team is gonna be sorry.
[people cheering]
- I'm on Phoenix's team,
and I feel amazing.
I feel like that's,
like, the dream team.
We have, like, the most talent.
I'm looking across the room,
and I'm like, "Ugh.
A bunch of boogers."
- In these two envelopes, I have
two scripts,
<i>Drag Queens in Outer Space:</i>
<i>From Earth to Uranus,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
and the sequel,<i> </i>
<i>Return to Uranus.</i>
- Thank you.
- Now, your sci-fi movie
trailers
will make their world debut
on the main stage tomorrow.
Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best woman win.
[cheers and applause]
- All right.
Let's go scandalous.
I want to be Boobarella.
Hermaphrodite, which is this
genderfuck evil queen,
mannish and womanly
at the same time,
and is absolutely jealous
of Boobarella's beauty.
- The villainess,
Hermaphrodite, is Mimi.
Fitting.
You better get your Oscar,
bitch.
- I'm gonna give you
Meryl Streep realness.
You got to get ugly
to win the prize.
- And, Tweaker,
this is perfect for you,
an alien space monkey.
The twinbots,
sexy robot twins.
Okay.
- Yes.
- I didn't want to pair up
with Shangela.
I mean, I haven't seen
no improvement.
She said she had worked
the whole entire year.
Where?
- We're filming
our sci-fi trailer today,
and we have to learn lines.
We got to make costumes.
- Yay, we have a great cast.
- Our cast is great, yes.
- We're gonna really win this.
- All right,
let's go over our lines.
- I feel like...
- Everybody, okay.
Let's start--start just going
over this.
- [clears throat]
- Phoenix's leadership skills
are a little questionable.
- All right, y'all ready?
- If you go to Mexico.
- It's actually a lot to
memorize.
- I think she was afraid and
really didn't assert herself.
Let's do our table reading.
- Okay.
- Bimborella,
looking for these?
- [high-pitched babbling]
- That's right, Tweaker.
- We've arrived at
Hermaphrodite's spaceship.
Prepare to tranny-port aboard.
- Twinbots, stay
on the lookout.
both: We are on the lookout.
- Y'all need to, like, come up
with a voice.
I don't want you to just use
your normal voice.
You're, like, robots.
- Rosie the robot, she wasn't
really that robot-y.
Her voice was kind of normal,
and...
- Yeah, we can be like,
"Oh, wait a minute."
- And in unison together.
- Yeah.
- Maybe I should have been
team leader.
- Lady Tata's been kidnapped?
- Prepare to gag
on my eleganza.
- The ship is surrounded
by a force field...
[laughs]
- We're trying to rehearsal,
and Mimi's being loud.
She's acting like
we're not there.
- I am...your father.
And your mother!
- Back off, Hermaphrodite.
- Your weapons are no good
here.
- That's not the line, baby.
"Your weapons won't work here."
- "Your weapons won't work
here."
- Read it.
- I got it, girl.
You get the punctuation
in your line.
I'll get my lines, all right?
- But just read the script.
You're doing your thing.
No tea.
Just read the scripts.
- Let's refocus.
Let's refocus.
- Mimi already is trying to show
that she is the star
of this group,
that she's standing out.
Miss Mimi, we know
you're talented, honey.
We know you have
the theater background.
Can we get through
one read-through, please?
- Hello, hello, hello.
all: Hey, Ru!
- Now, I'm just checking in
on my budding starlets.
all: Hey, Ru.
- Let's start with Team Phoenix,
<i>From Earth to Uranus.</i>
- That's right.
- Now who's playing what role?
- We've got Delta playing
Boobarella.
- Okay.
Pleasure to meet you.
Phoenix, I'm surprised
you didn't take the lead,
Boobarella, for yourself.
- I think she will make
an amazing Boobarella.
She's got this one.
Look--hello!
She's got it.
- And what is Manila playing?
- This is the Tweaker.
- Tweaker the she-monkey?
- Yes.
- That's hot.
You do have to create
your own language.
- Yes.
- Can you give us a little
taste of what that sounds like?
- I'm gonna be like...
[high-pitched babbling]
- That's beautiful.
- She ordered the Cobb salad.
- Yeah, she...
[laughter]
Now, I want to hear the twins do
a line together.
- Twinbots,
stay on the lookout.
both: We are on the lookout...
for single guys.
[both giggle]
- [laughs]
Oscar!
All right, ladies, work hard.
I don't want to see drag queens;
I want to see movie stars.
All right, get to work.
all: Thank you.
- Team Mariah.
- Hey, Ru, what's happening?
- The cast of<i> Return to Uranus.</i>
This is an epic.
Now, Mariah, what role
are you playing?
- Uh, the milkmaid.
[laughter]
No, I'm playing Boobarella.
- You assigned yourself
the lead role.
- Actually, I think it was
slightly unanimous.
- [laughs]
Now, you all picked the sequel.
As you well know, most of
the time, sequels suck.
So you have your work cut out
for you.
Make sure
that it's a hit picture.
- Yes.
- All right,
I'm gonna leave you ladies
to get camera ready.
- Cool.
- Good luck.
all: Thank you.
- Ladies, on the set, you'll be
visited by Michelle Visage
and our extra-special
guest judge,
the star of the sci-fi series
<i>Caprica,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
my favorite Cylon,
Alessandra Torresani.
- Oh, awesome.
[applause]
- Alessandra Torresani.
She is fierce.
- Now, they'll be here
to give you some pointers.
This is your chance to shine.
So lights, camera,
and don't fuck it up.
- Okay.
- Okay.
- Got it.
- Good luck, bitches.
- Good luck.
- Thanks, baby.
- I want to know why was I
fucking picked last.
- I don't know.
Why do you think?
- Do you think Phoenix
didn't pick me on purpose?
- I don't know.
- I heard she was--I heard that
she was threatened by me.
- She's threatened by you?
- Or she thought I was
her competition.
- I mean, if she's threatened
by you,
then she would think
that you were good,
and then that would be a benefit
to her
to have you on her team.
- Yeah.
- If she was strategizing
the way you think
she's strategizing.
- I just don't know.
- I didn't think that Phoenix
was threatened by her.
Phoenix hasn't mentioned that.
And I don't know what she could
possibly be threatened by.
Her name is Mimi Imfurst,
but she's not first,
and I don't even think
she's second.
I don't think anyone's placing
any bets on her.
- Hey, hey.
- Team Phoenix is on the set
of<i> Drag Queens in Space:</i>
<i>From Earth to Uranus.</i>
- Greetings, ladies.
all: Hi.
- I'd like to introduce you to
our guest judge today.
This is Alessandra.
- Hi, guys.
How are you?
- We will be directing
your performances today.
Let's get this show on the road.
- Let's do it.
- Bring it.
- Okay.
- Take one.
- Tata, twinbots,
we must intercept
the queen's spaceship,
or the balls will be held
in Uranus...
forever.
- Cut!
Delta.
- Yes.
- The line is "the queen's balls
will be<i> stuck</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
in Uranus forever."
"Stuck" is the punch.
- Okay.
We must intercept
Hermaphrodite's spaceship,
or the queen's balls will be
stuck in her anus.
- That would be "Uranus."
Just so we're clear,
it's "Uranus."
It's a planet.
Family show, honey.
- At this point, I realize
I should have probably spent
more time
memorizing my lines
than primping my hair.
- Action.
- We've arrived on
Hermaphrodite's spaceship.
Prepare to tranny-port
in three, two, one.
all: Dragonauts away!
- Phoenix, you're delivering
all your lines
away from the camera.
We need to see
your gorgeous face.
- Okay.
- Tata, twinbots,
stay on the lookout.
both: We are on the lookout...
for single guys.
- We've arrived at
Hermaphrodite's spaceship.
Prepare to tranny-port aboard
in three, two, and one.
- Phoenix.
- Yes?
- You keep looking away, girl.
You're giving somebody else
your time.
- Okay.
- I'm like, "Bitch,
just get it together."
- Phoenix, what's your
character feeling right now?
- I think I'm kind of...
I don't really know.
- Exactly.
- Phoenix, let's say that you
are super scared.
- Okay.
- But you're trying
not to show it,
because you're trying to
impress Boobarella.
- Let's give you one more shot,
Phoenix.
Full of emotion, baby.
We know you got it.
- Okay.
- Twinbots, be on the lookout.
- Prepare to tranny-port aboard
in three, two, and one.
all: Dragonauts, away!
- Cut.
Okay, Raja and Manila.
- The idea of having
Michelle Visage sitting there
terrifies me a little bit,
because that woman scares me.
- And action.
- [chitters]
[laughter]
- I'm wearing the smallest
little leotard,
and I'm getting
a huge cameltoe.
Tweaker got pipe.
- Manila, you're all ears,
girl.
- Hmm?
[laughter]
- Action.
- The most gorgeous woman
in the universe?
Don't you need to be a woman
first?
- Kill 'em, Tweaker!
- Whaaa!
[imitating lasers firing]
- Manila, do not make fake
sound effect gun noises.
It's not your backyard.
It's a movie, darlings.
- I don't know.
- Just look gorgeous
and do your lines.
Action!
- Say what?
- Action?
- Oh.
[laughter]
- Lady Tata is to become...
my bride.
- Lady Tata would never marry
a Martian like you.
- Cut. Tata, you're giving us
Maya Angelou.
Give us just a little bit more
Maya Angelou.
- Okay.
[laughter]
- I am from Crab Nebula, bitch!
- Yeah, Mimi, take it back
a little bit.
- Okay.
- Lower the energy
a little bit.
- Okay.
- Action!
- [screams]
- Miss Mimi.
There's a difference
in being talented
and being a showboat.
- Boobarella, I see you've
increased your war chest.
- Can I get the line?
- "Prepare to gag on my"...
- Thank you.
Prepare to gag on my eleganza!
[shrieks]
both: Get her, Boobarella!
- Shut the fuck up.
- No!
"Go fuck yourself."
- Go fuck yourself.
My lines have to be fed to me
a little bit,
and I'm like, "Oh, my god.
Please do not let me lead
these ladies off a cliff."
- [high-pitched babbling]
both: Has anyone ever told you
you look like an Ewok?
- The hardest part of my role
is to have to share it
with Shangela.
I wanted my spotlight.
both: Stop flirting!
You stop flirting!
Shut up!
No, you shut up!
Oh! Oh!
Oh, ho, ho, ho!
- Alexis and I,
as the twinbots,
we delivered when
we hit that set.
both: Dragonauts, away!
- And cut.
Nicely done.
Okay, that's a wrap, ladies.
Congratulations.
[cheers and applause]
Your sci-fi trailers will make
their world premiere
on the main stage tomorrow.
[cheers and applause]
Very exciting.
And Ru has asked you all to come
decked out in your finest
space-age couture.
[people gasp]
And we will be joined
by our extra-special, far-out
guest judge,
the legendary Lily Tomlin.
[cheers and applause]
- Lily motherfucking Tomlin.
You--you really--you don't get
better than that.
- All right, so until then,
live long and prosper.
[cheering]
[alarm beeps]
- Just as we left it.
- We're back in the work room.
Today we're getting ready for
the runway,
and we're all gonna get
decked up
in our shiny, metallic,
futuristic realness.
Miss Manila?
- Yeah?
- My hair is sticking through
in that wig.
Can you trim it?
- What, shave your hair?
- No, I just need you
to just trim the back.
- Can't you get someone else,
like the Delta or someone,
that does hair to do it?
- Mimi starts asking
the other queens,
"Will someone come over
and shave my head?"
Girl, what if I shave my head?
- And maybe have, like,
a little piece of hair
hanging down on the side?
That would be cute.
And have, like, a little
spit curl in the front.
- Do you want
to shave it real quick?
- Oh, uh-uh.
I don't have time, babe.
- I understand going
the extra mile,
but this is nothing but Mimi
pulling another production.
Her name should be
Cimi Imfurst,
because every time
we turn around,
she's doing something
for someone
to "see me, see me, see me."
- I feel so vulnerable.
I didn't hit the mark
in the challenge.
I wish I would have spent
a little more time
memorizing my lines,
because I expected more
from myself.
I hate how this thing, like--
you know what I mean?
Like, how is that even
a tight bobbin?
Like, that is not even
gonna work.
Now my job is to amp up
what it is that I wear,
how I conduct myself
on the runway.
I need to basically give 300%,
not 100%,
'cause it's just not enough.
Forget it. I'm using
somebody else's machine.
- [gasps]
How cyborg.
- Yeah, right.
- Yeah, your look is gonna be
on point.
- We will see.
I am team leader.
You know, I want to make sure
everything's perfect.
I need it to be on point.
I'm, like, a fucking nerv--
I, like, never get nervous.
- Why was I the villain?
Do you think of me as a villain?
- Yeah.
- How so?
- You could be antagonistic
if you--
- [laughs]
- Mimi, do you feel
that you worked well
with everyone in the group?
- I think so.
I think we had definitely
some clashing, but--
- Who clashed?
- I think you and I clashed,
girl.
- I think it's because
we both have
very strong personalities.
We both had an idea
of how we wanted the production
and our role to go.
But in the end,
you have to release
and trust each actor to be able
to take the role on
and put their own self into it.
- I'm really proud
of my performance
in the trailer.
I really think I hit it
out of the park.
- Shangela underestimated me,
but I know what I can do,
and now she does too.
So you're cool?
Me and you cool?
- Girl, we're always cool.
Listen, you can take nothing
personal in this life.
- Indeed.
- It has to be really severe.
- I look over, and Mimi puts on
this headpiece,
and I think she looks like
Uncle Fester
from<i> Addams Family,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> honestly.</i>
- Mimi looks ridiculous.
If that's what the future has
in hold for me
or for my kids
or for my grandkids,
I'm--I'm scared.
- [laughing]
[RuPaul's<i> Cover Girl]</i>
- Hey, guys.
Welcome to the main stage
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
So what do you think
of my dress?
both: Whoo-hoo!
- Are those pussy willows?
- They sure are.
Santino, you've got it
every time.
Michelle Visage.
- Yes, my darlin'.
- Are you ready to have a close
encounter of the drag kind?
- I am tweaking my knobs
and setting a course direct
for the Milky Way.
- [laughs]
- Bring it.
- Alessandra Torresani.
My favorite Cylon.
You look gorgeous.
- You do as well.
- And the great Lily Tomlin
is here.
- Thank you, Ru.
- Now, this week, our girls made
their film debut
in the sci-fi saga<i> </i>
<i>Drag Queens From Outer Space.</i>
Now, decked out in their best
futurama glamorama,
they're ready for a blastoff.
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win!
Space age.
- When I dress up, I'm always
looking for perfection
and a complete look,
and that's my strength.
- Does that outfit come
with solar panels?
Get ready for Raja.
- Whoo!
- All right, Miss Raja.
- C-3PO's girlfriend.
- Yes.
- Any time I'm on the runway,
I'm sparkling.
I'm having a blast up there, and
I'm doing my robot runway.
- The queen who fell to Earth.
Up next...
Wow, look at those.
- Oh.
- You're gonna put
somebody's eyes out
with those things.
- I'm feeling 100% diva
in my whole space costume.
Very Gaga,
very Christina Aguilera,
very Britney
all mixed into one.
- She's a galaxy girl.
- Yes, she is.
Up next...
Oh, wow!
Flash Gordon does drag.
- I'm just trying to show
in the runway
that I'm a little Power Ranger,
and I am feeling on fire.
- Wonder Woman
from outer space.
Her clone does not sleep alone.
- I'm in a body suit,
for god's sakes.
Just having curves
and just being able to walk
down the runway
and have the judges look at you
made me feel really good.
- Danger, Will Robinson.
Stacy Layne Matthews
is on the run.
Next, Shangela.
- Ooh.
- Shangela's
a real bubble head.
- Captain Shangela.
- She's a Starship Trooper.
- So I'm on the runway,
and I'm, like, "Ooh,
this is super hot."
I feel so much more confident
hitting it the second time back.
- The queen
of the space cadets.
Beam me up.
Up next, Mimi Imfurst.
Supersonic.
- My headpiece is inspired by
the planet Krypton.
I'm just going
to make my look be
as out of this world
as possible.
- Oh!
- Oh, my god, those eyes.
- She's serving satellite TV.
Oh, my stars.
That's some kind of futuristic
chastity belt.
- So I'm on the runway, praying
I don't trip over these shoes,
'cause they are a bitch
to walk in,
praying they like it.
But I'm feeling good.
- Kiss me. I dare ya.
From planet New Jersey...
She's blinding me with science.
- I'm walking that runway,
and I'm thinking,
"This hair better not come off,
"and I'm gonna keep my neck as
perched as I can,
"and I'll just shake my ass
a little bit
and just hope for the best."
- She's an astronaut.
- She's got a mind
for rocket science
but a body for sin.
Look who we have here.
Representing Atlanta, Mariah.
- Our hair looks very similar,
doesn't it?
- Yes, it does.
- I truly feel like supermodel
of the universe.
I am stomping that runway.
- She's not having any trouble
with her Tribbles.
All right, Delta Work.
She's giving us a total eclipse
of the heart.
- I'm hoping the judges are
going to love the difference
between what I'm wearing
and the sort of
metal-colored-inspired costumes
that they're seeing.
- She's a real Judy Jetsetter.
Next up, Manila Luzon.
That ensemble is just rocking
my universe.
- I'm coming down the runway,
and I'm giving evil henchwoman
realness.
I kind of wanted to separate
myself from the other girls,
because I think a lot of girls
kind of had, like,
a similar look.
- She's got a big dipper too.
- She sure do.
- Welcome, dolls.
Now it's blockbuster time.
Team Phoenix, let's take a look
at your trailer.
Help me, Boobarella.
You're my only hope.
- Whoo!
- Delta Work as Boobarella.
- I have a hunch things are
about to get a little ugly.
Twinbots, be on the lookout.
both: We are on the lookout...
for single guys.
[laughter]
- Carmen Carrera and
India Ferrah as the twinbots.
both: Resetting course.
- Prepare to tranny-port aboard
in three...
- Phoenix as Lady Tata.
- Two, and one.
- [laughs]
[warbling]
Bimborella.
You looking for these?
both: Give us back those balls.
- Sarlaccs!
- Raja as Hermaphrodite.
- No one can hear you
lip-synching in space.
Prepare to die.
- [high-pitched babbling]
- That's right, Tweaker.
- And Manila Luzon as Tweaker.
- Whoo!
Shama-la-la-la-la bing bong.
[weapons whooshing]
[laughter]
- Cute.
Wonderful.
- The other group
was all over the map.
I'm feeling really confident.
I think we could win this thing.
- Next up, Team Mariah.
Let's take a look at the sequel.
- [cackling]
- Prepare to gag
on my eleganza.
- Mariah as Boobarella.
- [shrieks]
There's something
I want you to know!
I am...your father.
- Mimi Imfurst as
Hermaphrodite.
- And your mother!
- Go fuck yourself.
- I did!
That's why I'm your father
and your mother!
- Ew!
- Stacy Layne Matthews
as Lady Tata.
- The gas levels indicate
that Uranus is burning.
both: Hey, Tweaker.
Stop flirting.
You stop flirting.
Shut up!
No, you shut up.
- Shangela and Alexis Mateo
as the twinbots.
- [screeching]
- Tweaker, no!
- Yara Sofia as Tweaker.
all: Dragonauts, away!
- Damn you, Boobarella...
Ella--ella--ay--ay--ay.
[screams]
[laughter]
- I am so happy, 'cause I was
so worried about my accent.
But it actually came out
very cute.
I'm so proud of myself
right now.
- Ladies, the reviews are in.
And based on your<i> Drag Queens</i>
<i>in Outer Space</i><span style="bodyStyle"> movie trailers,</i>
we've made some decisions.
The winning team is...
[dramatic music]
Team Mariah,<i> Return to Uranus.</i>
[people cheering]
Condragulations.
You are all safe.
- Thank you.
- Yes!
- But three of you emerged as
breakout stars.
Shangela.
Alexis.
The twinbots.
Mimi Imfurst.
- I'm feeling super confident.
Comparing myself
to everyone else in my group,
I think that I stand a good
chance of winning this one.
- I can only choose one.
Oh, damn the rules.
Let's call it a tie.
Shangela, Alexis,
condragulations.
You have won this challenge.
Each of you will receive a set
of hand-sculpted silicone
breastplates
courtesy of boobsforqueens.com.
[cheering and laughing]
Did you hear that, Lily?
Boobsforqueens.com.
- Yes, I did.
[laughter]
- However, neither one of you
will be granted immunity
next week.
Team Mariah.
Thank you, ladies.
You may leave the stage.
Team Phoenix.
Each of you is up for
elimination
except, of course, for Raja.
You have immunity.
Now it's time
for the judges' critiques.
Let's start with Phoenix.
What'd you think of Lady Tata?
- I think you could have been
a little zanier,
especially with a name like
Lady Tata.
- I do believe that you were
the weakest link in this cast.
- You just didn't commit.
Because you had fewer lines,
you should have committed 150%
just to show up everyone else.
- India Ferrah.
- I was very taken
with your bosoms.
I thought they were just
completely believable--
from this distance, anyway.
- I love, love, love this look.
- Thank you.
- This is Judy Jetson
does Vegas.
- Thank you, India.
All right, up next,
Carmen Carrera.
Now, Carmen, you're having some
trouble with your headpiece.
- This is, like, kind of
a mixture of super glue
and spray adhesive to my head.
It's literally pulling the hairs
out of my scalp.
- It's such an extraordinary
waistline.
It's just incredible.
You must have had a rib removed.
- I think your outfit today
is poorly conceived
and poorly designed.
- Carmen, stop relying
on that body.
- All right.
Thank you, Carmen.
Manila,
tell us about your outfit.
- I wanted to do, like, a
really sexy, like, Grace Jones,
Thierry Mugler-inspired,
like, catsuit.
- Well, you failed.
- [laughs]
- No, just joking.
- I thought your character
was great.
- Thank you.
- Very original and unexpected
and totally committed.
- Thanks, Manila.
Delta Work!
- You could've gone way out
with that Boobarella character.
You seemed more like a
combination of divine and Dali.
And I liked that.
- What is futuristic
about this look?
It looks a little dated, and
other than it being shiny,
I don't see space.
I don't see sci-fi.
I don't see the future.
- I sort of was inspired
by the look of that 1950s
and '60s feeling
of what space-age would be.
- Now, what about
her performance as Boobarella?
- In the performance aspect,
you had to do
a million things at once.
I think for your first time
on film,
I think that was a very hard
character for you to play,
but you did listen to us.
- All right, ladies.
I want a piece of advice
from you.
Who should be going home
tonight?
Manila.
- I think...
Phoenix.
She was our leader,
and I think that the leader
has to take responsibility.
Carmen.
- I kind of agree with Manila.
She was our leader.
- India.
- Phoenix,
one of the first things
she actually told us to do
was, you know, change our voices
for our characters,
so that's one of the things that
I expected from her as well.
- All right, Phoenix.
- I think for you to come out
in just a catsuit
that I have 15 of,
I don't really think
that's worth $75,000.
- But you're wearing
a catsuit.
- I think that I've got
so much more of a $75,000 look.
- Manila, is there something
you want to say
about your $75,000 catsuit?
- [laughs]
- I got this made for $100,
so I guess I could make
75...uh, hundred.
- Do the math, honey.
- I'm Asian,
but I don't do math.
[laughter]
Sorry.
- All right.
All right, Delta,
it's your turn.
Who do you think should go home
tonight?
- Based on the runway
presentation,
I would say myself.
- All right, Raja.
- I just don't like the idea of
the possibility
of my friend leaving,
'cause Delta and I--
I was so excited to see my
very good friend here with me
in this process.
I hope that if she has to
lip-synch for her life,
that she fucking lip-syncs
for her mother[bleep] life.
You know what I'm saying?
- Amen.
- Thank you, Raja.
Thank you, ladies.
Now, while you untuck in
The Interior Illusions Lounge,
the judges and I will
deliberate.
You may leave the stage.
All right, ladies, ladies.
Just between us girls,
let's start with Phoenix.
- I was gagging.
She was horrible, and she didn't
look very good either.
- She was definitely nervous
the whole time.
- But her runway ensemble today
looked really futuristic
and great.
- India Ferrah.
- Well, I liked her costume.
It was nicely pulled together
and interesting.
- I was saying, are we gonna
see the boobs every time?
- I have a feeling, yes.
- Yeah?
- [laughs]
- On to Carmen.
- I didn't think her costume
was well designed.
- It's a bikini with a corset.
- She came out, and she had
her sort of head pulled down
so that the thing--I thought
she had osteoporosis.
- You wanted to give her
some calcium.
- Yes!
Is she out of her league?
- She needs to step up
her game.
- Now Manila.
She took what could have been
a disaster of a role,
and she ran with it.
- Oh, yeah.
She was great.
- Delta Work.
When she described what she was
doing, a retro look,
I understood it.
It's just the execution of it
wasn't well done.
Did she have trouble
with her dialog?
- She did indeed.
We had to go over that
quite a few times.
But she really wanted to get it
right, bless her heart.
She wasn't like...
[scoffs]
Like, she really was listening
and really took the direction.
I thought we were happy
with some of the decisions
she made as an actress.
- Now, the decisions she made
as a stylist
on the runway tonight,
not so much?
- She's contacting
a different person in her head.
- Yeah.
- It didn't look Judy Jetson.
- I felt like when she was
standing next to everybody else,
she felt, like, almost sheepish.
- Silence!
Bring back my girls.
Welcome back, ladies.
I've made some decisions.
Raja, you have immunity.
- Yes, I do.
- You're safe.
- Thanks.
- Manila, you had us at...
[high-pitched babbling]
Condragulations.
You're safe.
- Thank you.
- Phoenix, now, as team leader
and Lady Tata,
you let us down.
I'm sorry, my dear, but you are
up for elimination.
- I do not want to go home
up against people that are
not as good as I am.
- India Ferrah.
Condragulations, you are safe.
Carmen.
Your runway presentation was
weak and lacked vision.
Delta,
your Boobarella was curvaceous,
but your look on the main stage
left us flat.
Carmen...
you're safe.
- Thank you.
- Delta, my dear, I'm sorry,
but you are up for elimination.
- I knew that Ru was gonna
announce me
to lip-sync for my life.
I don't know that I should have
been there,
but I didn't think our entire
team should have been there.
I mean, I thought it was a load
of crap.
- Two queens stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me
and save yourselves
from elimination.
The time has come for you
to lip-sync
for your life.
Good luck,
and don't fuck it up.
- Get it, bitch.
I want them to see the fire
that is in my eyes right now.
- I see Phoenix, you know,
copying a few of Gaga's moves,
and I think that's just poor
entertainment, honestly.
Don't copy anyone else.
And Delta was being herself,
and, you know, not trying to be
Lady Gaga.
- I'm not trying to be shady
in any way,
but Phoenix is a man
doing movements.
[cheers and applause]
- Whoo!
[applause]
- Wow.
- Phoenix.
Delta.
I have made my decision.
Delta Work.
Shantay, you stay.
- [exhales]
Thank you very much.
[applause]
- [whispers] I'm so happy.
- Phoenix.
Rising from the ashes.
For a great queen like you,
this is just the beginning.
Now sashay away.
- Thank you so much.
Thank you.
[applause]
- We love you.
- For me to go home and some of
these people remain
is very crazy to me,
especially when I look
at certain people
in this competition
that definitely are not the best
that America has to offer.
- Ladies, remember,
if you can't love yourself,
how in the hell you gonna love
somebody else?
Can I get an "amen" in here?
all: Amen!
- Now let the music play.

killer cast of competitors.

little girls.

at the top 12 queens'
audition tapes.
- I really, really like to be
naked.
- Plus unforgettable footage
of some of the ladyboys
who didn't quite make the cut.
- I'm keeping my baby.
- Can I get an "amen"?
- Heer neer.
- And just when you thought
it was safe to go outside...
Shocking.
<i>Drag Race's</i><span style="bodyStyle"> first ever</i>
open casting call.
- I will sleep with anybody
if it helps me get the part.
- [gasps]
Get ready for an hour
of amazing transformations...
- [giggles]
- Outrageous fashions...
- Do you know how many Muppets
I had to kill?
- And more lip-syncing for
your life than ever before.
- Top that, J.Lo.
- All this and some sexy
pit crew auditions
not suitable for work...
unless you work for me.
So take off your pants,
and let's dance.
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> casting</i>
extravaganza starts now.
- [screams]
- Greetings, race fans.
Welcome to the starting line
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
season three.
Months before the competition
begins,
we scour the nation
to bring together the best
drag divas in America.
Get ready to gag on the gaggle
of glamour girls I've gathered
for this go-around.
But before I reveal
this season's top 12 queens,
let's take a look at some of
the home videos sent in
from the thousands of hopefuls
who dream of becoming America's
next drag superstar.
- My name is Miss Kiki,
a.k.a. Antonio Forte.
- Hi, RuPaul.
I'm Jacqueline.
- I am Misty Eyes.
- My name is Yekaterina
Petrovna Zamolodchikova,
but please just call me Katya.
- I'm Dax ExclamationPoint.
I come to you now in a look
that I'm calling--I'm calling
Seth Nando Barbie.
- I am Vivika Westwood Mugler.
Right now, we're in the middle
of the Bronx,
in the middle of the projects,
in the middle of the night.
- My character is very unique,
because I'm kind of bipolar.
- Miss La Fierce is ferocious.
She's...
Arr. Rowr.
Rowr!
- This is Sushi Vega,
the fiercest, baddest bitch
performer in Texas.
And if anybody has anything
to say about it,
they can speak to my mother.
- Hello,<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
My name is Andrew Levitt.
I grew up in Canton, Ohio,
which is the Pro Football
Hall of Fame capital.
Then I moved--
- I am the fierce diva
that is going to end up
ruling this country.
- I'm in my car.
That just tells you I'm ready
for the race, doesn't it?
- I'm gonna stop you right now
and tell you that if you do not
cast me, this show's gonna suck.
- Ru, you need somebody
interesting on your show.
- So get me on the show,
heer neer.
- Please pick me.
[giggles]
- All of my dreams have come
true except for one thing!
I need to be
on<i> RuPaul's Drag Race!</i>
- I deserve a shot
on<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> because...</i>
- And if you give me that call,
I can be on my way in a jiffy,
because--well, right now,
I'm bumming, but, you know...
- I really want to be on TV.
-<i> Mami, yo tengo esta</i>
<i>en RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
You have to cast me, mami!
- And if you don't get me on
the show, you better believe
I'm gonna be right here sending
another video tomorrow.
[laughs]
- And so choose me
for<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
season three.
Because let me tell you
about a drag race.
This bitch knows how to run.
Can I get an "amen"?
- Amen.
- Amen. Holla.
- Amen.
- Is that it?
Did we get it?
Amen.
- Those queens ain't too proud
to beg,
and I applaud them for their
shameless self-promotion.
Oh, did I mention my book,
<i>Workin' It!</i>
<i>RuPaul's Guide</i>
<i>to Life, Liberty,</i>
<i>and the Pursuit of Style,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
is available on Amazon?
I didn't think so.
[ding!]
Now, speaking of selling
themselves,
these next two queens
sold me on the fact
that they were the best
of the best.
So let me introduce the first
queen chosen to compete
in this season
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
From New York City,
Manila Luzon.
- Hi, my name's Karl with a K,
not a C.
Hi. I'm Manila.
The thing that I have
that you haven't seen
on your show yet
is that I'm Asian
and I'm taller than 5'2".
I'm Filipino.
Well, my mother's Filipino.
My dad's white.
So I'm a mix.
The Philippines
is the birthplace
of the prison<i> Thriller</i><span style="bodyStyle"> video</i>
and famous for the former
first lady Imelda Marcos.
- My favorite song to perform,
I think, of all times is<i> Vogue.</i>
I actually like
performing it better
as just, like me
and, like, picking out
fashionable clothes
and voguing.
My category is face.
- I have a famous boyfriend.
He's on TV.
You guys might know him
by the name Sahara Davenport.
both: Hi!
- Hey, there, it's me, Sahara,
wishing my baby girl, Manila,
all the best of luck.
And you guys better pick her.
- Looks like Manila's
gonna be a thriller.
The next queen to be competing
this season
is from the Garden State,
New Jersey's own Carmen Carrera.
- Yo, what's up?
This is me, Chris.
And I want to audition
for<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
Carmen Carrera is this, like,
fly-ass, glamorous girl.
She just has no worries.
I really, really like to be
naked
and just make costumes
out of unordinary things.
The animal-print pasties
with the mohawk,
that's, like, really Carmen.
Like, Carmen likes to be
really naked.
This is my drag closet.
Couple of sexy things,
skirt that I made.
Rhinestone.
My shoes.
I got married last year.
Me and my husband were
extremely happy about that.
He has a four-year-old daughter,
so I'm kind of, like,
stepmother.
I'm going to give you guys
a little runway,
stop some traffic.
Doing drag and performing
is important to me
on a personal level,
because it helps me grow
as an individual
and as an artist.
[RuPaul's<i> Jealous Of My Boogie]</i>
I can perform for people
and have them take something
from my show,
whether it's happiness
or whether it's inspiration.
I really appreciate your time,
and I hope to hear back soon,
all right?
Amen.
[clicks tongue]
- Like a prayer, this Jersey
girl will take you there.
Now, this might surprise you,
but many of the queens
that auditioned
are still in the closet.
It's true.
Of course, they're just in there
playing with dresses and wigs
and pantyhose.
And lucky for you, they invited
us in to take a look.
- I'm gonna show you my closet.
Take a look.
- This is my closet.
I'm gonna take you on a tour.
I have named it
The Interior Illusions Lounge.
- I spend a lot of money
on drag to look cheap, honey,
and I don't need any other bitch
to take it from me.
So, yes, it's a double lock,
as you can see.
- I'm about to show you
Joaya's fierce closet.
So here it is.
This is pretty much her closet.
- Drag closet, drag closet.
Come on. Let's go.
Everything that I have--
my house is so small
that I have to hide it
under the house.
- This is my special closet.
It's my freezer.
- Some people say garage.
I say closet.
- There she is.
- I don't wear
99% of this stuff.
- I wear this to all
the appropriate events,
like family functions, dinners.
- Oh, and listen to it.
[dress rustling]
Merry Christmas.
- Everybody should have
at least one good
straightjacket.
- I go from different looks.
You know, sometimes I'm demure.
Sometimes I'm classy.
Most of the time, I'm whorey.
- This is my closet in all
its--oh, we have bras.
Am I supposed to show this?
- Little bit of cheetah,
leopard, and my zebra.
But one thing you'll never find
on me is beaver.
- I have developed
quite an affinity
for gluing shit
to other shit.
- And then this is my
Space Girl Goes Green.
She, you know--
she a little scandalous.
- This is my alien space queen
outfit.
I hope you like it.
I am a natural green hair.
- This right here
is a lovely feather boa
made out of...
scented trash bags.
- And right here is where I make
my own theatrical rhinestone
jewelry.
- Those are some true
fashion plates.
The first time a man puts on
a wig, some makeup,
and a pair of heels,
and prances out that door
is the ultimate act of courage.
Many of our hopefuls told us
about their first time in drag.
- When I first started
doing drag,
I looked like a five-cent
prostitute clown.
- I started, you know,
a zesty mess in a dirty dress,
like everybody.
You know, my best girlfriend
would do my makeup,
and I'd put on a flat wig
and clothes from the body shop,
and I thought I was real.
And I thought, "Oh, my god,
it's just like prom
but every night."
- I started doing drag,
actually, on Halloween.
And if you would have asked me
back then
if I was gonna be a full-out
drag queen,
my answer definitely
would have been no.
- I was kind of a mess,
you know.
I was walking around.
I was, like--I had that wig on,
and I was roll around,
"Ho ho ho ho."
- I decided I was gonna dress up
as Liza Minnelli
just for one time, and I'm never
gonna do it again.
Shockingly enough,
I had so much fun,
from that point forward,
I knew that I was going to
become the drag queen
that I am today.
- I started doing drag
in Lincoln, Nebraska.
There was a competition
for people who had never
did drag before.
And all my friends were like,
"You should do it."
I'm, like, "I'm not
a drag queen," you know.
So I came in, did that
competition, and won
and beat, like, nine girls.
Like, they say
that I was the girl
that came bucking at the gate.
Like, it was just my calling.
- I used to photograph
drag queens in L.A.
for about a year and a half.
I was just like, "You know what?
"I'm tired of taking pictures
of drag queens.
"I'm going to turn the camera
and the spotlight onto me,
and I'm going
to make it happen."
I started off in this one
little bar in the Castro.
I called all my friends.
I was like, "Bitches, you guys
better be there.
"And even if I suck,
I don't give a shit;
"your asses are gonna scream
like you had just seen Madonna
poop on herself."
- When I was in college,
I was dating a man
who said he'd never sleep
with me again
if he ever saw me in drag.
This devastated me.
But I was answering
to a higher power
the night I picked up the flyer
for Chi Chi Larue's
fishbowl contest.
And you know what?
I walked away
with that fishbowl trophy
and a cash prize.
- Those queens have nerve.
And it do take nerve.
Now, here are two queens who
are ready to let you have it.
A professional makeup artist
who's worked with
some very big names.
Meet Raja.
- My drag character
or my drag name is Raja.
I'll be 36.
I'm a makeup artist,
and I'm a female impersonator.
I'm gonna sound
really fucking old,
but I started really young,
and I've been doing this
for about 20 years now.
As soon as I came out
of the closet, I was like,
"I'm gonna be
a fierce fucking bitch."
So my brows were tweezed.
My hair grew.
I kept my weight
at a certain weight.
I wanted to be a supermodel.
That's all I wanted to be.
I've always known
in the back of my mind
that there's something better
about me than everybody else.
I think I have
a different insight
and an understanding of
the world.
Raja is a jet-setting,
avant-garde supermodel.
She's a little boisterous,
but at the same time,
she's very classy.
We're about to explore
my closet.
Definitely have to be thin.
No fat girls allowed.
[chuckles]
So this is one of the pieces
that I made.
Not bad, right?
Sometimes I go have coffee
in the morning down the street
and I go down through
West Hollywood,
go to the thrift shop
in this gown.
I've been watching<i> Drag Race,</i>
and I'm frankly disappointed
at the collection that these...
men are wearing.
They don't have shit
like this.
I watch them, and they're just
walking around
in their, you know,
home sewing machine, like,
cheap Lycra nonsense.
And, frankly,
I don't understand it,
and I think it's irresponsible,
and I think they need
to get it together.
I'm a makeup artist.
That's what I do.
And I work with a ton of
celebrities.
This is my friend Adam Lambert.
So what do you think about me,
like, trying to become
the next top drag queen?
- You are the top drag queen.
- Oh!
- Those bitches
better look out.
- There you go.
Enough said.
- You're going to kick
their ass.
- Sorry about that.
- Not only is Raja
the prettiest queen;
she's also the most creative
and resourceful
and [speaking indistinctly].
- To me, drag is an art form
and it's a visual art.
And so the more visual it is,
the more powerful it is
and the more important it is.
- This drag veteran
is ready for the race.
You go, mama.
Here's a diva supreme
who comes to<i> Drag Race</i>
with a daunting reputation.
From the Buckeye State,
meet India Farrah.
- My name is Shane Richardson.
I started drag
at a very young age,
at the age of 12, actually.
And my brother,
whom is also gay,
was currently in a relationship
with a drag queen
in my hometown,
who got me started in drag
and gave me the drag name
India Farrah.
Oh, hello.
When did you get here?
No, it's not Kris Kardashian.
It's me, India Farrah.
I started performing
at the age of 14.
There's been some hardships
that I've had to face.
A lot of people actually tried
to bring me down
when I was younger,
because I started so young.
And luckily, with the support of
my family and close friends,
it was a battle that I overcame.
This is my closet,
and I want you to come in
and take a look with me.
This right here is a new wig
that I just created, actually,
and it weighs about 20 pounds.
This is a little fabric boa
that I made.
Makeup, lashes.
I like to keep stock of stuff.
One of my top hats for Rihanna.
This right here
is my galaxy costume,
and I absolutely love it.
[fast-paced music]
Why is drag an important part
of my life?
I would have to say since I was
homeschooled since second grade
by my parents,
that drag allowed me
to be more social and outgoing.
So I think, honestly, drag
helped me out a lot.
And I think that's why I click
to it so much.
- You have seen
my audition video
for<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
season three.
I hope to be seeing you
at the starting line soon.
Can I get an "amen"?
- This dancing queen is gonna
bring the heat to the runway.
You know, my ladyboys aren't
the only ones who have to prove
they've got the right stuff.
I put potential pit crew
candidates
through their paces too.
And trust me; it was grueling.
- My name is Patrick Cronen.
I'm 27.
I did swing for eight years,
but primarily dancing
in the mirror
is how I occupy
my spare time these days.
- I would have to say
I like my stomach the best,
'cause I put the most work
on that.
- I played football for the
University of South Dakota
for five years.
I'm an actor/model, and I can't
dance worth shit.
- I sew, I paint,
and I do an amazing one-handed
hand stand
while humping the wall.
[chuckles]
- I'm a musical theater actor
and dancer.
I'm the biggest pussy
you will ever meet.
I cry at everything.
I got a nice butt.
It's big.
[boing]
- I'm very confident.
I have some Tom Cruise moves.
You need to get ready, actually.
- I do cry at movies.
I'm very emotional.
And I think I'm a good dancer.
Yeah, got a great ass, so...
[laughs]
- I'm a ex-go-go dancer.
My favorite part of my body is
my ding-dong.
[elephant trumpets]
- I'm actually not a dancer
at all.
- So the one thing you probably
would not know about me
is that I can be very buff.
I can look like I'm really
cut up and really ready to go.
But I can also get really skinny
very quickly.
- I have in my blood
the mighty DNA of God.
So I have his blessing.
I can do it all.
both: We are from Russia.
- My age is 21.
- And I'm 18.
Sometimes we dance
in the shower.
- My name is Alien Hanson.
I'm the world's best dancer.
[cymbal crashes]
My career goals are to be famous
and to be a household name
on everybody's TV screen.
- The economy's turned terrible,
as we all well know,
and I turned to male escorting
to put bread on the table,
to feed my family,
and keep the women happy.
I was a<i> Playboy</i><span style="bodyStyle"> model,</i><i> </i>
<i>Penthouse</i><span style="bodyStyle"> model for years.</i>
- Yeah, I'm probably a little
too short to be a model.
- You know, everyone sees
my chest,
and it just drowns
everything out, so...
See a little bit of that?
[laughs]
- My name is Shawn.
I'm 31 years old.
I work in outdoor advertising.
My favorite part about my body,
I guess, would be my midsection.
[laughs]
- My favorite aspect of my body
would have to be my abs.
- I love my chest.
That's all.
Other people always comment
on my ass, though.
- Hi, my name is Jason Carter.
I'm 29.
I am a dancer/radio jockey/
host.
That's what I do for a living.
What I like best about my body
is my abs.
- Do you see how I suffer
to bring you this show?
You can thank you me later.
Actually, you can thank me now,
because the season three
pit crew is here.
Say hello, boys.
both: Hello, boys.
- This season, we received
a lot of submissions
from plus-sized ladies.
Let me just say,
the bigger the cushion,
the better the...drag queen.
- I'm really freakin' annoyed
with all the big girls
that have been
on<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
A big girl can't make it past
the first or second episode.
- I'm 6'7" flat-footed,
7'2" in heels.
I wear size 17 shoe.
And I dance like I'm little.
[laughs]
- Initially,
when I first started drag,
I was always too big
or I was always a booger
or I was not feminine enough
or not this enough
or not that enough.
- My butt goes up and down
on the scale and everything.
But a girl doesn't have to pad.
- You know, I was always
the fat kid,
and drag just gave me confidence
to be ballsy, brash,
kind of like a Mae West.
- I make fun of myself.
I don't want to make fun
of other people.
Yeah, I'm a bigger guy.
I'm a bigger drag queen,
a bigger girl.
But I have a lot of fun.
- Unfortunately, those zaftig
queens didn't make the cut.
But here are two delicious dames
who did.
This next queen
will not be ignored.
Joining the competition,
it's my pleasure to introduce
Mimi Imfurst.
- Hey, everybody,
it's Mimi Imfurst,
the hardest-working bitch
in show business,
and I'm the fat bitch
you're looking for.
You need to put a fat bitch
on the show
who's gonna tell it
like it is.
You need to put a fat bitch
on the show like me,
who's gonna deliver,
'cause I'm sick and tired
of messy fat girls
misrepresenting the big girls.
Honey, I'm gonna come in.
I'm gonna squash
the competition.
I don't care
if you're skinny or fat.
I know how to win.
I'm gorgeous, I'm glamorous,
and I'm semi-retarded,
and that is the advantage
that I need to take over
and be America's next
drag superstar.
All my drag is big
and glamorous and super campy
and smart.
And most importantly, I'm a
fierce motherfucking lip-syncer.
This is my fabulous closet.
As you can see, there are wigs
and dresses.
Lots of ruffles and sequins
and feathers.
Do you know how many Muppets
I had to kill to make this?
I didn't make this one,
but I have Asian slaves
in Thailand who did.
- What I love about doing drag
is that it's empowering,
is that it allows you to be
anything that you want to be,
that you can take
what you were born with from God
and transform it
into whatever you can dream.
- We'll see if Mimi has
what it takes to finish first.
Bow down for our next queen.
From Back Swamp, North Carolina,
Miss Stacy Layne Matthews.
- Hello?
Oh, what's up, RuPaul?
It's me, Ron Jones.
Give me a second.
I'll be right out.
I'm gonna show you a little
glimpse into my life.
My drag persona
is Stacy Matthews.
She's vivacious.
She's large and in charge.
So being a big girl,
don't let anybody ever tell you
that you cannot do the things
that small girls can do,
because I've done it all.
I would say
my life as a drag queen
has been the most fabulous thing
I've ever experienced.
I've been doing drag now
for about nine years.
Being a plus-sized queen,
it's not always easy
to have the confidence
that you need,
especially living where I live.
I am from the deep South.
This is my closet.
I want to show you a few things
that I've been working on.
Here are some of my shoes
that I do wear.
We've got this...flower gown.
You see that fringe, girl?
- Being in the Bible Belt,
people around here
look down on people like us,
because they don't
understand it.
So I do not feel upset or angry
at those people.
It's my job as a queen to
show them that we're people too
and we deserve respect.
- This country queen is busting
out of Back Swamp
and coming for the crown.
Let's hear from some of
the other hopefuls
to find out what inspired them
to do drag.
It's a little package
I like to call
"everything you wanted to know
about being a ladyboy
but were afraid to ask."
- This is my calling, and this
is what I'm supposed to do.
- I could have never anticipated
all the people
that I would meet
or the places that I would
travel to.
- In my charity work,
I've raised almost $200,000.
- Doing drag, to me, means
escaping the everyday life.
- Drag enables me to be
a supersonic version
of who I am on the inside.
- I don't want to be a woman.
I just want to dress up
and have fun.
- Drag, for me, gives me that
courage and that fearlessness.
- You can wrap people
around your little finger,
and they can't say a word.
- For me, drag is like therapy.
And so I don't have to pay
a therapist.
- Drag, for me, was an art form
that I can actually hide
all of my feelings behind,
from all the name callings
or just the word "faggot"
in general.
- I am not a gay man.
I'm a straight man
that performs in drag
for entertainment.
- When I was 19, my mother
kicked me out of the house.
By doing drag, I was able to
eat, to dress myself,
to go out shopping.
- I have two younger sisters.
They saw me perform
for the first time,
one of the best things that's
happened to me when performing,
because I really love
performing.
- I've done everything.
I've worked in Lower Manhattan,
the financial district,
for six months.
I've sold sunglasses
at the mall.
I've even been a contestant
on<i> Showtime at the Apollo.</i>
But nothing comes close
to the satisfaction that I get
from doing drag.
- A drag queen
is a true artist,
and her body is the canvas.
As many queens showed
in their audition tapes,
their face painting is nothing
short of a masterpiece.
Eat your heart out,
Michelangelo.
Raa!
- I put some Elmer's glue stick
over my eyebrows.
And I'm just gonna give you
a very pretty fishy lady face.
Aren't I gorgeous?
Don't you want to do me?
[kisses]
- First of all, it takes me
a good shower.
You must wash that ass
before you get in drag.
- I always do my makeup.
Normally, I take a good hour,
like, on my face.
And I'll put on
a really cute outfit.
When I walk into the bar,
I'm ready to perform.
- Now I'd like to show you
what it takes to become Versace.
So undergarments are an
extremely important accessory
for a drag queen.
I like to take in my waist
even further
with a cincher like this one.
And this is not my real ass,
but I did pay for it.
- This is what it takes to
transform into Jackie
along with a--with a nice big
roll of duct tape,
and we're all good.
And some couch cushion.
'cause you know
I'm a white girl,
so I got to put the curve in it.
- Can I get a "amen" up in here?
- Speaking of stunning
transformations,
the next two queens
competing this season
are masters of illusion.
First this high-energy queen
could give the Energizer bunny
a run for her money.
From the isle of Puerto Rico,
Miss Yara Sofia.
- I'm Gaby, a.k.a. Yara Sofia.
I'm from Puerto Rico.
I was born and raised here
in this beautiful island.
My character's name come
from a girl that I have
in high school.
She had beautiful legs.
So everybody told me
that I have beautiful legs,
and that's why I'm Yara Sofia.
When I look in the mirror,
I wasn't boy.
I was a girl,
'cause I love being a girl.
Now we're gonna talk fashion.
I have too many looks.
This one is a remake
from Alexander McQueen.
I could never forget the shoes.
What Yara Sofia loves to wear,
the animal print,
'cause I love animals.
I'm a fierce bitch.
- I want to compete
in this fabulous race,
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
So here I am.
This is the time.
The third time is the time,
'cause after Jessica Wild,
the Puerto Rican girl
will win this race,
this competition.
It's for us.
So be prepared and watch me.
- Will Yara's edgy style
get her to the finish line?
<i>Escandalo.</i>
This next queen impressed me
with her professionalism,
not to mention she put the "hot"
in Hotlanta.
It's my pleasure to introduce
Phoenix.
- Hi, my name is Brian Trapp,
also known as Phoenix.
Hi,<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
Phoenix here
in Atlanta, Georgia.
I started drag, like,
ten years ago.
I kind of started doing these
little, like, amateur contests
and started winning.
And I kind of just got pushed
into the scene, and here I am.
The biggest hardship
is the boys.
The boys are crazy with it.
Like this year alone, I've had
this happen several times.
I'll have a guy, like,
all into me as Brian,
and then they figure out
what I do,
and it just completely changes.
It, like--
and it drives me insane.
I just look at me doing drag
as more of another way
for me to be creative
and be an artist.
I don't really consider myself
just a normal drag queen.
I look at myself as more like
an entertainer.
- I've pretty much been
a full-time entertainer,
and now I work six days a week.
I have one day off a week.
But I'm ready to do
something different,
and I really think,
from what I've seen
with<i> RuPaul's Drag Race,</i>
it gives you a larger scale
to work with.
Bye.
- Rising from the ashes,
Phoenix is ready
to burn it down.
Now, that's my kind of queen.
For the very first time,
we held open auditions
on Hollywood Boulevard.
[people cheering]
<i>Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> judge Santino Rice</i>
joined me,
and we got to meet
some very colorful characters.
- Let me get in on your shot,
girl.
I'm sorry, girl.
- Let me in there!
- Security?
- My name is Delta Work.
I'm from Norwalk, California.
And I'm here to try out
for<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
season three.
I'm so excited.
I put my tape together
the day before the deadline.
I rushed it.
I was ready to go.
The waiting's over, and I'm
ready to take it to the top.
- You ain't gonna do nothing.
- You shady cow.
- My name is Venus D-Lite.
I'm 26 years old.
I'm from Los Angeles,
California.
I think what sets me apart
from all the other drag queens
is that I'm unique,
I'm professional,
and I like to get
the shit done.
- Hello, world.
It's me.
It's Terlene.
I'm America's next
drag superstar,
'cause I have the fucking gall,
the talent, the nerve.
- I'm America's next drag
superstar,
because I am a superstar.
- I'll cut some bitches
if I have to.
I'll do whatever I have to do.
- I'm not worried at all
about the competition.
Bring it on.
I've dealt with a lot
of shady queens.
I'm ready, RuPaul.
- Where would you put this
if you were me?
- Tell us
about your drag persona.
- My name
is Miss Mona Lot-Moore.
- I'm Miss Barbie Q.
- I'm Allusia.
- Mercedes Electra,
the Hollywood icon.
- I bet you are.
- My name is Detox.
I'm pretty much, like, a mix
between<i> Jem and the Holograms</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
on crack
and Patrick Nagel.
- Oh, well,
that's all you need.
- Whoo!
All right!
Yeah!
Whoo!
Bring it on, baby!
Bring it home to mama.
- I feel like a fake
Barbie right now, to be honest,
the way I'm talking.
Do I sound like a Barbie to you?
"Yes, hello.
How are you?"
- [chuckles]
- I'm Christina Boss.
I'm 16.
Okay, I'm 27.
Shh.
- Vickie Bouffant.
I'm 37.
And, bitch, I am from Chicago!
Originally.
- Hi, I'm Wendy Watch
from Wetumka, Oklahoma,
and I'm 42 years old.
- Mona can go from gowns
and, like, glamour
to solicitation
on the streets.
[record scratch]
- Are you Lady Deuce?
- Yes, I am.
- How'd you get the name
Lady Deuce?
- One of my really, really best
friends,
her name is Lady Deuce.
Kind of, like, a tribute to her.
- You have a best friend
whose name is Lady Deuce?
- Yes.
- And you decided, "I think
I want to use that name too."
Did you try Claire Voyant?
What about Sarah Tonen?
- No.
- Tara Misu?
- Tiramisu?
- Yeah.
- Isn't that, like, a soup
or something?
[cymbal crash]
- Hi, good morning.
- Hello.
How gorgeous you are.
- Thank you.
My name is Delta.
I'm 34 years old.
And I'm from the city of
Norwalk.
I've been doing drag
for over ten years.
- Do they tip
in southern California?
- On a good night, yeah.
I hate showing up to,
like, Ross,
and paying all ones, but...
- Do you cross-dress for less?
- I cross-dress for more,
'cause I got more to cover.
- Okay.
- A lot of the "big girls"
that do shows,
it's always a comedy.
I do comedic things.
I do things that are serious.
Hopefully, overall, the thing
that runs through it all
is just entertainment.
- Awesome.
What unique skills do you have?
- I can stick my tongue
behind my uvula.
- I've been tap-dancing
for the last ten ye--
last ten--
[gasps] 20 years.
- I can sing live.
I've been classically trained.
- Hmm, well, my physical talent
right now is a little tucked.
- I can, uh, make a dinner
for 40 on $1.95.
- Oh!
Oh! Ah!
Ah!
Mm.
- [laughs]
- I can get spots
out of anything.
- I can do this.
[crickets chirping]
- Jiminy Christmas.
- Yeah.
Ah.
Well, hello there.
What as surpris--look at that.
- Oh, do you live?
- Oh, Mary McFadden,
eat your heart out.
- Oh, yes.
- I love it.
- Now, this is just day wear,
okay?
You got to see my evening wear,
okay?
- You're Venus D-Lite?
- I'm Venus D-Lite.
- Now, you look like
a country queen.
- It's a little Cyndi Lauper
too.
- Just a little bit.
I'm giving, like, Cyndi Lauper,
Judy Jetson.
- Who do you pattern yourself
after?
- Madonna, Grace Jones,
Barbra Streisand.
Madonna just shocked people,
and that's me as a performer.
- How long have you been
performing?
- Almost ten years, and I'm 26.
- Oh, my goodness.
- Wow.
- Jailbait queen. Brilliant.
- Thank you.
- I tell you what.
Let's take a look
at your lip-sync prowess.
Are you ready?
- Yes.
- Okay.
- Can I turn around?
- Yes, ma'am.
- [clears throat]
- Is this new?
- Yeah, it's new.
- [laughs]
It's the new new.
- Is this KISS FM?
- I know you're watching.
Oh, my goodness!
Don't hurt nobody, now.
Oh, okay.
Yes.
- Gorgeous.
- [laughs]
Thank you guys so much.
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you, baby.
- Thank you, Allusia.
And we'll see.
- All right.
Mwah. Bye.
- Well, thank you so much,
Reya.
- Thank you.
- Thank you,
and I will sleep with anybody
if it helps me get the part.
Just putting that out there.
- Thank you.
- Well, Mercedes Electra,
thank you very much.
- Thank you.
- And that boa is amazing.
Wow.
- It's like the embodiment
of being gay.
- Now, would you wear a boa
like that?
Well, I got to tell you,
you know,
I'm so impressed with you.
I think that you are--you're
what we're looking for.
And, Venus, you're coming
to<i> Drag Race.</i>
- [squeals]
Oh, my god!
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.
- [laughs]
- Thank you.
- Don't fuck it up.
- This is the best thing that's
ever happened to my life.
I'm so excited.
This is just--oh, my god.
I finally won my Academy Award.
Oh!
[squeals]
- You know,
you are so unspookable.
- Am I?
- Yes.
- Okay.
- Well, condragulations, Delta.
You're in.
- Really?
So in the running, like there's
one more step, or...
- No, you're in, girl.
- [screams]
Oh, my god!
I just got on<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i>
season three!
I'm excited.
I'm ready.
Let's do it.
Start the race.
Shoot the gun.
- All right, darling.
- Buh-bye. Thank you.
- Bye. Awesome.
All right, Santino, I think we
got some really gorgeous gals.
- The world is going to gag.
- The world will be gagging.
Let's go.
- Let's get out of here.
- Every drag queen knows
that there's one thing
that can never be too tight:
her lip-sync.
Because one day, her very life
may depend upon it.
- Some of those lip-syncers
were pretty tight.
But, unfortunately, none of them
made the final cut.
My advice to those girls is to
keep working on your game,
because persistence pays off,
as proven by this next queen,
who applied not once, not twice,
but three times
before being invited to compete.
Please meet a girl who won't
take no for an answer,
Alexis Mateo.
- Hi, everybody.
My name is Alexis Mateo
from St. Pete, Florida.
I'm 30 years old.
I always bring something
to the table
completely different
and completely fresh.
And I'm original
from Puerto Rico,
and I come from a broken family.
I grew up
always trying to be accepted
and always trying to be
part of something.
When I was 12 years old,
I realized that all my dreams
were set in the performing life.
This is Alexis Mateo,
the little character
that I create inside my room
after that fabulous first
drag show that I saw.
It's the only thing
that I have of my own,
that nobody can steal from me.
When I'm with other drag queens,
I do have a very strong
point of view that I defend
and that I make myself be heard
and be respected.
Let me see.
What else can I show you?
This, I started
with a long dress,
and I just kind of cut it.
I use Mardi Gras beads sewn.
It's completely turned
into a giant ball gown.
I love the 3D effect
of the flowers.
- Alexis Mateo means to me
everything.
I love Alexis Mateo
because of that,
and, of course,
I love Alexis Mateo
'cause he can disguise
as everybody
and just be himself.
- This pageant queen
has her eyes on the prize.
And last but not least,
this breathtaking beauty
is from Atlanta,
and we call this queen Mariah.
- I am Mariah, and I reside now
locally in Atlanta, Georgia.
Mariah, she's an eclectic
bundle of inspiration
from everybody.
My style,
especially professionally,
is pretty much
just to go in there,
do what you have to do
without a whole bunch
of unnecessary extra.
Well, I don't perform
professionally.
That's not, like,
my form of income.
I don't do it for a living.
I actually compete
in the ballroom circuit.
And so it's pretty much kind of
a sudden-death version
of a pageant.
You have about 30 to 45 seconds
to prove yourself.
I'm bringing my "A" game,
so y'all girls better have your
lashes, your wigs,
and your fish grease,
because this one's
gonna be good.
Okay, so I'm officially out of
the closet,
ponytails and all.
This is the magic room.
This is, like,
all my human hair wigs.
This is where I keep them,
'cause they're so delicate.
They're so easy to tangle.
If you don't condition
and shampoo them
like you would your real hair,
oh, guess what.
This is where I keep
all my drag,
my feathers and hair
and shoes and things.
Actually made these myself.
I can't wait to serve y'all
little girls.
- Life is a drag,
and it's fabulous.
I mean, I'm really actually
couldn't see myself
doing anything else.
It's been an ongoing process
of meeting new people,
learning new things.
To me, my whole life--
it's an adventure.
Just enjoy it.
Don't take anything serious.
Except for your hair.
- Mariah is bringing ballroom
heat and serving realness.
So there you have it,
the 12 top queens competing
this season
for the title of America's next
drag superstar,
the best of the best.
Manila Luzon.
Carmen Carrera.
Venus D-Lite.
Delta Work.
Raja.
India Farrah.
Stacy Layne Matthews.
Mimi Imfurst.
Phoenix.
Yara Sofia.
Alexis Mateo.
And Mariah.
Now, as fun as their audition
tapes were to watch,
let me tell you,
you ain't seen nothing yet.
These gentlemen are about to
start their engines.
And spoiler alert:
the best woman wins.
So buckle up for safety,
and I'll see you
at<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
season three.


- Previously
on<i> RuPaul's Drag Race...</i>
Condragulations, ladies.
You are the top three.
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Alexis Mateo.
- Stretch and lift.
Are you guys at home getting it?
Sickening, no?
- Cha-cha-cha!
- Cha-cha!
- Yes. Big ol' titties
and lots of ass.
- Look at those hips.
- The drama.
- Papi, I want you to come
back home, baby.
Bam!
- Hello!
- Manila Luzon.
That ensemb-la from the house of
of Imelda.
- Mabuhay, mabuhay.
What's next?
- Oh!
- Is that a bomb?
For the love of money!
- What you buzzin' about?
- Oh, yes! Okay!
- [chattering]
- That is what a lip sync for
your life is all about.
- Yes! Work!
- Raja.
No stranger to the runway.
- No one can hear you
lip-synching in space.
Prepare to die!
- Navajo.
- And tonight...
The winner
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race...</i>
The final countdown...
America's next drag superstar
In this season's stunning
conclusion.
Is...
The winner of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i>
will receive a lifetime supply
of Kryolan professional makeup;
headline Logo's<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> tour,</i>
featuring cocktails
perfected by Absolut;
and a cash prize of $75,000.
May the best woman win.
[tires screech]
- Nice.
- What! Top three, byotches!
- Oh, yeah, that's what
I'm talkin' 'bout.
- We're back into the workroom
today, and Yara Sofia is gone.
- Oh, my god, it's like
a paragraph.
[Manila laughs]
Oh, and there's a flag!
- Yara is my sister, and it's
kind of sad to see her leave.
But it just gonna make me work
harder to reach my goal.
I came here to be America's next
drag superstar.
The top three.
Did you all imagine
that I was gonna be here?
I didn't know
I was ready to be here.
I mean, I always wanted to.
- Yeah.
- But, oh, my gosh, it got
so difficult.
- It got so difficult!
This is so much more difficult
than I ever imagined.
- This has given me
a completely newfound respect
for Alexis.
I've teased about her and called
her a booger, but she's here.
She's part of the top three.
She's worked
just as hard as I have.
I love looking at all these
empty spaces in the room.
Like, I just remember
all the voices and personalities
that were here with us.
- When I first saw Raja, I was
like, "What the fuck?"
Remember you walked in
with that one eye?
[laughter]
I said, "What is this?<i> </i>
<i>The Muppet Show?"</i>
And then Manila was
the other one.
Oh, my gosh, Manila, in the
beginning, you were so annoying.
- I didn't realize how annoying
you were until midway,
and I was like...
[laughter]
- Okay, y'all think
I'm annoying.
Now, imagine what it's like
for me to live my life.
Trust me; I know I'm annoying.
Actually, Raja, I'm really happy
that I got to meet you,
because you've been doing it
for so long,
and it's nice to know that,
like, you can still do it
when you're in your late 40s.
- The library is closed!
[siren]
- Ooh, girl!
You've got shemail.
Mirror, mirror on the wall.
Who's the queeniest of them all?
Who's got the style?
Who's got the grace?
Who's got the balls
to take my place?
Now, if more is more,
then bigger is badder.
And when it comes to your
dreams,
size really do matter.
Mm-hmm.
- What does that mean?
- I think whoever has the
biggest dick, honey.
- I won!
- Yay!
- [laughs]
- Hello, hello, hello.
- Oh!
all: Oh!
- It's me, your favorite judge!
I'm here to deliver
your final challenge.
Ru's often said
that this competition is like
the Olympics of drag.
And now this is your chance to
go for the gold.
This week, you become
Greek goddesses.
all: Oh!
- Living statuary.
- Oh, beautiful.
- Prepare for the clash
of the Xanadu Titans
as you costar in the music video
for RuPaul's single<i> Champion.</i>
[whooping, laughing]
- That's awesome!
- Yeah!
- The brilliant Mathu Andersen
will be your director,
and the super-talented
Ryan Heffington
will teach you
to dance like goddesses.
- Yay!
- And...
to keep up your strength,
you'll each have
a one-on-one luncheon
with Miss RuPaul herself.
- [whooping]
- Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.
[all cheer]
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi, ladies.
- Hi!
- When I first saw Ryan,
I said...
- Today we're gonna work on some
choreography
for RuPaul's new song,<i> Champion.</i>
So let's really try to take it
out on this contemporary mode.
It's about being
a statuesque goddess.
Raja, can I have you take
this box here?
- I'm a little nervous,
because I am a runway girl,
and I don't know about dancing.
That's not my thing.
- You are statues,
but you are gonna morph
into different positions, okay?
So I want to see you guys
hit poses
every four counts.
One, two, three, four,
and then morph.
One, two, three, four.
Hold one, two, three, four.
Pose, one, two, three, four.
Okay?
Here we go.
Five, six, seven, eight.
And hah, two, three, four.
And switch, six, seven, eight.
Hold one, two, three, four.
- Whoo!
I'm gonna fall off the box.
- Raja, let's try to be more...
hieroglyphic,
beautiful statues, yes?
Again, five, six, seven, eight.
And switch.
- Oh.
- Manila, make it a little bit
more grand.
You are a statue.
They've carved you out of stone.
This is not gonna get it.
Now cross over.
Go!
Bah bah bah bah bah.
Bah bah ah-bah bah bah.
And through.
And through.
And through.
And off camera, yes.
- Oh, I see.
- Yes, yes, yes.
Alexis, her poses are amazing.
She knows how to portray
the character I'm asking for,
and it's instant with her.
The other two girls are really
gonna have to pull up
to match her.
- Hi, Ru.
- Darling!
Have a seat.
- Walking towards Ru
to have my lunch with him
is nerve-wracking.
It's a moment that could define
the whole competition.
- I've taken the liberty
to fix you a plate.
- I'm on a diet.
- Just have half of one.
- [laughing]
- Who is rooting for you
back home?
- Well, my family's rooting
for me.
[tearfully] I am so blessed.
When I walk in my house,
I can be myself with my mom,
with my sister...
with my friends.
And it's completely strange
that people
that I met in United States
that, like,
they always keep me going.
- So they're an extended family
that you've created in America.
I'm sure that they're<i> very</i><span style="bodyStyle"> proud</i>
of you.
Now that there are three,
what is your strategy?
- Well, I just gonna be myself.
And I am very sure
that I am perfect,
so it doesn't matter
what happens in the competition.
I know I'm a star.
- You already are a star.
Well, we had lunch,
and you didn't touch a thing.
- [laughs]
I told you I was in a diet.
I want to work on my body
so Michelle likes it.
- [laughs]
All right, darling.
You just keep on flying.
- Thank you for lunch.
The bill's on you.
- [laughs]
- Bye, Ru.
- Hi.
- Now it's time for us to
rehearse the part of the routine
where we get to use a pit crew
member as a prop.
- It should look like you've
known each other forever.
Actually, no.
You've known each other
for two nights.
It's always a little bit more
heated after...that point.
Yes. Mm.
Now peeking over
the shoulder.
And in that moment...
ah, we missed that moment.
Come back.
Yes, now get intimate and
closer.
Ah, and down, down, down, down,
down, down, up.
- Ta-da! No?
- Do you have a fear of
intimacy?
- Little bit.
I'm having the hardest time
focusing.
And I understand
where it's coming from.
He is probably seeing me
holding back,
because I fucked up a lot
in my life.
I want to win this contest.
And I really do not want
to fuck this up.
- It's about the intimacy
between you two,
and I think if
it's a little bit more true,
it'll read true on camera.
- Okay.
- Okay?
Raja really needs to let
her guard down.
I think that's what she's gonna
have to break through
in order to make this part
of the video work.
- Well, hello there!
Have a seat.
- Oh, thank you.
- What's been the hardest part
for you?
- Being away from my family,
not being able to call.
Hopefully,
they'll be proud of me,
because this is my medium.
- You're saying hopefully
they'll be proud of you.
Is there a chance that they
won't be proud of you?
- You know, it's a part of me
that my father really doesn't
like to be a part of.
Ever since I was a little boy,
he tried playing catch with me,
and he said, "Oh, well, this is
not gonna work."
- [laughs]
What do you think it would take
for your father to come around?
- Part of it is me.
I feel like my dad's probably
willing to learn
and be part of my lifestyle
as a drag queen.
I came here hoping that I would
be successful at it,
and then I could come back
and be like,
"Dad, Dad, look what I did."
He'd be so proud of me, even if
it's not, like, the ideal thing
that he would want me to do.
- I want you to say to him
what you're feeling,
what you would want him to take
from your being on this show.
- Daddy...
um, I couldn't have been here
without you and Mom.
It feels nice to be blessed,
to have, um...
like, a supportive family,
'cause I know lots of people
don't.
- And you're one of
the lucky ones.
It would be great for your
father to be proud of you,
but the truth is, it's about you
being proud of yourself.
- Well, hello.
- Hello, hello, hello.
- Welcome.
- Now it's time to rehearse
the part of the video
when I gonna be joined
by the pit crew guy.
- So we are now gonna work
on the more intimate side
of the video.
- Can we take the clothes off?
- Whatever helps.
- Let's go.
- And rotating in...and...
Beautiful, yes, yes, yes.
Gorgeous. So from here...
I want you guys to improv.
- Oh, Jesus.
- But I don't want you to
separate.
A little closer.
Don't lean away.
Get into it.
Uh-huh. And...
[Alexis giggling]
No laughing.
Stay connected...
and work there for a moment,
improv.
[both laughing]
No laughing!
- It was very nerve-wracking
to have somebody
that you don't know
work with you as so close,
because it's a very intimate
moment.
- It's a simple...
- Touchy-touchy.
- Touchy.
You know, maybe it's here.
Click.
Shabam, bam, bam, bam, bam.
Alexis has dance background.
However, when it comes
to turning off
that stage persona,
I think it's really hard
for Alexis to do that.
Hopefully, she can just be
a little bit more in the moment.
Even though I'm giving you
choreography,
it should not look like
choreography.
It should look like you guys
are in your bedroom,
on your satin sheets,
working it out.
- Hi, Ru.
- Well, hello, Raja.
- What is this, Thanksgiving?
- [laughs]
- I couldn't possibly.
- You're a bit of an introvert.
- Sometimes, yeah.
- When you're on the runway,
you own the room.
How does an introvert live
in the body of an extravert?
- [laughs]
- How does that work?
- Duality comes from me being
a Gemini, I think.
There's a whole other side of me
that's a complete ham and
exhibitionist,
and I really love
being in front of people.
- Who's rooting for you
at home?
- I'm really hoping
that my parents
are going to pay attention
and really see what I do,
maybe for the first time
in their lives.
- Wow.
- You know, they've been
in some of the great moments
in my life,
but never have they seen
how proud I am to do what I do.
This will be a really great way
for them to see how much life
it brings to me.
- Is there anything you want
to tell them?
- Hi, Mom.
Hi, Dad.
Look at me;
I'm sitting with RuPaul!
[laughing]
That's a drag queen,
and so am I.
[both laughing]
- Look, darling,
lunch was fabulous.
Break a leg out there.
- I will.
- All right.
- All right, see you later.
- Thanks, doll.
- Bye, Ru.
- And arms come in
around to his chest.
Yeah. Beautiful.
And...uh, okay, cool.
- Oh, oh, oh, watch yourself.
Watch yourself.
I'm a married woman.
It's kind of awkward.
I have to get all, like, nasty
and grind up on some, like, sexy
greased-up man.
- Look at each other.
- You're so greasy!
What's my boyfriend gonna think?
Sorry, baby.
- Oh, my god,
it's a music video.
I never imagine myself
in one of RuPaul's video.
- I've imagined it before.
I just didn't think
it would actually happen.
We're about to shoot
Ru's video,
and I'm a little scared.
I have put in a lot of blood,
sweat, and tears
into this competition.
Now's the time to put on
the real show.
- Oh! Blond Asian, y'all!
Get used to it.
- It's the final challenge,
and it is bigger than ever,
because this is
some serious shit.
This is the real deal.
The jig is up.
- Wow!
Here comes the bride.
We walk onto set, and there's
Ru, a vision in white.
- She looks like a goddess.
It almost looks like a dream.
- Okay, smoke up!
Action!
- Faces!
- Extend those lines!
Go!
- And go!
Go, Alexis, go!
Go!
- Go, go, go, go, go!
- Cut!
Yeah, uh, so try not to leave
too early.
Let the girls pass the end.
You'll be the last one to leave.
So just work the center there.
Don't leave too early.
- Oh, bitch,
I was just called out.
RuPaul's standing right there,
and I'm screwing it all up.
- You'll be the last one,
so just turn, keep posing.
They cross. They cross.
You cross.
- Okay, they cross.
They cross. You cross.
- Yes.
- The first take was a mess.
We don't want Ru thinking, like,
"Oh, these three queens
are gonna fuck
my whole music video up."
We don't want that.
- Long neck, Alexis.
Give face, give bone.
- And...
- More robust!
- Quickly, here we go!
- Oh!
- Cut!
Thank you.
- I almost fell.
- We are not hitting
what we need to hit.
It has become a circus.
- This is our last thing
with Ru, understand?
So get it right.
- Nip slip, aisle four.
- Yes, ma'am!
- Keep that energy up, ladies.
Here we go.
- Action.
- Go!
- And arms, arms, arms!
Hold!
And exit.
Nice.
Much better!
- Much better, ladies.
- Thank you.
- Moving on?
- Yes, moving on.
- I love how I'm wearing, like,
a bikini
on top of, like, a onesie.
- Fierce.
- The Greek goddesses part of
the video is over,
so now we're gonna be athletes
since we have new, black, sexy,
skimpy-ass costumes.
- Raja, let me use your glue
for a second.
- Alexis is wearing huge hair.
Probably not the smartest thing
to do.
I mean, you're trying to be
fierce athletes.
- Whoo!
Olympi-who?
Yes, mama.
Let's do this.
And action.
- A-one, two, three, four.
A-five, six, seven, eight.
And one, two, three, four.
We have to hit our marks,
ladies.
- Manila, you were off.
- I'm sorry.
- If you're off,
you're just gonna get hidden
behind Alexis's hair.
- It's really hard
to see your mark
that's, like, a little tiny dot
on this big, white stage.
And Alexis's hair is, like,
totally, like, in my way.
- Action!
- A-five, six, seven, eight.
And one!
- Oh, sorry.
- Cut. Try it again.
- Manila fucked it up.
- Sorry, guys. I'm sorry.
- When you hit it, you can do
that, but don't...
because someone's hair is
very large,
and it blocks other people.
But I'm not saying who.
- They trying to blame my hair
because of Manila's mistakes.
Bitch, don't hide behind me.
You got your mark.
The bigger the hair,
the closer to God.
- And one, two, three, four.
Five, six, seven, eight.
And up and up
and up!
That was the best shot, yes.
- Now we're going to introduce
boys to the mix.
- Manila, let's hit it.
Five, six, take your time.
Seven, eight.
Moving through it.
And ah.
Let this be a moment here.
Ah.
Lift that leg.
[Latin guitar music]
- I'm a ballerina.
I am 93 pounds.
- Take it slow.
Ecstasy.
Come up slowly...
and improv here for a second.
- Oh!
- Oh.
[both laugh]
- Okay, that was beautiful.
- Awesome.
- Let's move along
to our next victim.
- Raja, you're up.
- Yay! I get to touch
naked man body.
- Here we go. Ready?
- Mm-hmm.
- And...
- Yes, mama.
- Beautiful.
- I feel, um, unfaithful.
[giggles]
- And...it kind of looked like
a head job.
- Before you start going down
his body at the end,
hold it for a second.
- Okay.
[laughs]
Sorry about it. Okay.
[sensual music]
- Yes!
- Now, this is the moment
right here.
We want to see it.
- Beautiful, you guys.
Keep moving.
[both gag]
- She's done that before.
- And...
- Bam.
- Yes, take me!
- All right, high kick.
- I'm tingling!
- Nice!
- I had to just really let go
and realize that you know what?
Raja, you are known for being
a sensual performer.
It was all about me doing
what I do
and doing it well.
- Hello, Alexis Mateo.
- Let's hit it, from the top.
- And...action.
[light rhythm]
Sensuous.
Beautiful.
- Okay. You flip me?
- Alexis, you're going to have
to focus on your profile,
because when you turn front,
you have no--you're just...
both: Hair.
- [whispers] Such big hair.
- All right.
- And...action.
- And go, Jason.
[light rhythm]
Profile.
- Beautiful.
That's beautiful.
Gorgeous, Alexis.
- Maybe some more arms.
- I like it.
It's like a live sex show.
- And...
yes, cha-cha around each other.
And go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
- Bam, baby!
- [laughing]
Bam!
- Okay, ladies, 25 minutes to
shoot the whole video.
- Grab your prop.
So, Miss Javelin,
you'll go first.
- Sure.
- Do it hard and fast.
- Keep the tip up.
Go.
- Beautiful. Great.
That looked good.
Bow and arrow, Alexis.
Make me believe that you're
a huntress.
And go!
Okay.
- Manila, you're up.
- Ooh!
[laughs]
- Action.
- Go, go, go, go, go!
- Action.
That was nice.
Okay, and serving...discus.
Action on spinning
and...play back.
- I think my earliest drag live
growing up
was being in talent show,
the little boy pageants.
Now I am in RuPaul's video<i> </i>
<i>Champion.</i>
I'm a champion.
- Coming to this competition,
I knew that I was going to be
put through the wringers.
It's exhausting.
But the highs and lows, like,
all just kind of blended
into one fun ride,
and it's great.
I feel alive.
- I have told myself in the past
that I couldn't do anything
right
or I wasn't good enough.
Right now, it's just about me
showing off.
I am fearless, and I am beyond
proud of myself.
[song ends]
- [gasps]
The last day ever!
- The last day!
- Oh, my god.
- We're back in the workroom,
and it's the very, very last
day,
and someone is gonna get a crown
tonight.
I'm so excited.
- I don't mean to be corny, but
let's just do a quick group hug.
Can we?
- Oh, yeah.
Oh, I love you guys!
- All drama aside,
it's just the three of us,
and went through
this whole thing together.
And it's very comforting to know
that two other people know this
experience as well as I do.
- Sisters forever.
- Okay, stop humping!
Oh, god!
- Alexis, what is that?
- I don't even care how I did
or how it comes out.
I'm in RuPaul's video,
motherfucker.
- Hey!
- Lick it. Lick it.
- You better work it out, miss.
- [laughs]
- Do you guys think
that you've changed,
like, being in this
competition?
- I think my performance style
definitely changed.
I feel like I've gone
to college, you know,
and I'm graduating or something.
- You know, honestly, like,
I feel like I've changed a lot,
because I never did drag
as, like--
you know, full-time, really.
So it's really cool
to actually experience
doing it, like, hard-core.
- I haven't changed.
I still the same, bitch.
My drag haven't changed at all,
'cause where I come from,
it just one way to the drag,
and that's read it in a book.
- Raja.
- What?
- Why do you think you should
win this competition?
- Because I'm fiercer
than you guys.
- [scoffs]
- Well, you got us there.
- [laughs]
- If I don't win,
I would love to see you
get crowned, Manila.
- Oh!
- Really soon, America will know
who will be
America's next drag superstar.
- [laughing]
[RuPaul's<i> Cover Girl]</i>
[applause]
Well, hello, there.
Welcome to the main stage of<i> </i>
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
Tonight it's just family,
so let's get nuclear.
Michelle Visage!
- RuPaul!
- [laughing]
My muse.
Can you believe
it's almost over?
- I cannot.
Very sad but very happy night.
- Yes, bittersweet.
- Indeed.
- Santino Rice.
- Ru!
- Are you ready to crown
a winner?
- I'm ready.
We've got three amazing queens.
And I can't wait to see what
they bring to the stage tonight.
- Yes.
For the grand finale,
we challenged our girls
to become Greek goddesses for
my newest video,<i> Champion.</i>
Tonight they've put together
outfits
that will take your breath away.
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.
For the grand finale,
welcome Raja.
- All that jazz
and then some.
- Oh,<i> Cabaret.</i>
- Willkommen, bienvenue.
- I'm walking down the runway
for the last time,
and I'm just
in this moment right now.
I'm not really thinking
of the competition.
I'm just gonna rock it.
- Nothing beats a great pair
of legs.
- Bob Fosse.
- Yeah.
- Life is a cabaret!
Up next, Manila.
She done brought her own crown.
- [laughing]
- I'm walking down the runway,
and I'm just in my gown.
I've got sparkly jewelry
all over the place,
and I feel like a winner.
- Look at that train.
Work all of that train, mama.
- Chartreuse charmeuse.
- Mm, gentlemen prefer Manila.
Alexis Mateo.
Sunday in the park with Alexis.
- Yes, she can-can.
- I pick my showgirl costume,
because it's the last time
that the judges is gonna see me,
and I wanted to remind them
that this is who I am.
Alexis Mateo
is all about the show,
is all about the glamour,
and the stage is mine.
- And she vajazzled her head.
- She brings her own shade to
the runway.
- Yes, she does.
- Yes, she does.
- Meet me in St. Louis.
Wow.
My top three girls.
Each of you won three
challenges,
which is pretty amazing.
Are you ready for the judges'
final critiques?
Let's go.
So, Raja, let's take a look
at highlights
from your performance
in the<i> Champion</i><span style="bodyStyle"> video.</i>
[RuPaul's<i> Champion]</i>
[applause]
- I love your take on drag.
I love your Victor/Victoria
look.
You are a star.
But I would say I'm not
feeling you as a blond.
But it did look Grecian.
- Love this look on you
tonight.
And I love androgyny, especially
when it comes to beauty.
You really know how to work
a camera for a beauty shot.
But you would have been stronger
if you had more makeup.
- Manila Luzon.
Let's take a look at highlights
of your performance
in the<i> Champion</i><span style="bodyStyle"> video.</i>
[applause]
- You got to do your scene
with Jason.
I could smell the chemistry.
- It was hard,
because I'm thinking, like,
"My boyfriend's
gonna kill me.
My boyfriend's gonna kill me."
- Well,
as an international star,
Sahara will just have to
learn to accept that.
- You've saved this,
and you just brought it
to us tonight in a big way.
I think it would look better
with smaller earrings.
But it's a lot of fun to see you
come out here.
And I love, you know, when
you're just, like, giving it.
If you could bottle that
for a beauty queen,
you would be a billionaire.
I think you looked stunning
in the video.
Some of the choreography was
a little bit awkward.
- Manila Luzon, from week one to
the top three,
you've been consistent,
never too old to be a princess.
And you are such a pretty,
pretty princess tonight.
The video,
I loved that little lift.
I've told you before I'm not
a fan of you as a blonde.
Your face was still gorgeous,
but you kind of lose you
when you do the blonde.
I love the streak.
That's about as blonde
as you should ever go.
- Alexis Mateo.
- Hola.
- Top three.
- Bitches, we did it!
[laughter]
- Tell me about your outfit.
- Today I wanted to show
who I am for real,
and, like, I'm a showgirl.
- I want to take a look at the
highlights from your performance
in the<i> Champion</i><span style="bodyStyle"> video.</i>
[laughter, applause]
- Yes!
- So how do you feel?
- I feel like when you want to
roll your "r" so bad, like...
rrrrr!
[laughter]
- I really thought you brought
the overall kind of athleticism
and almost Olympic quality to
this piece.
- I'm gonna be completely
honest with you.
You were one I did not expect to
see in the final three.
Every time I counted you out,
you brought it and shut me up.
All I can say
about the video is,
you stayed true to who you are.
Even in the Grecian times,
you were doing some cha-cha.
There was not a minute
in this whole competition
that you ever let down
your sweetness
and your vulnerability
and your honesty.
You're just adorable.
- Oh, Michelle said something
good about me, bitches.
[laughter]
I have to cha-cha for that,
'cause I'm so happy.
- Tonight before the judges and
I deliberate for the final time,
we'd like to hear
from each of you alone.
Alexis, you're first.
I want you to give me
a pro and a con
for each of your competitors.
- Raja's pro is the runway walk,
like nobody else
in this competition.
Something that I don't like
about Raja:
he's so hard to read.
Manila was the only girl
in the competition
who I really want to punch
in the face.
I was like, "Manila, I think
you're annoying," and she said,
"You know what?
I think so too."
And we actually got one thing
in common!
[laughter]
- I want your pros and cons.
- Every time I make a decision
to move forward in life,
I am my own enemy.
If I wish I could have changed
something about my life,
it would be how hard I am
when I judge myself.
But I am a fighter.
And I don't regret anything,
because it have make me
so strong
that I actually can say
I am my biggest hero.
- Alexis Mateo was one of
the first queens
that, like, really
stuck out in my mind.
I think she's an amazing
performer.
As for cons,
the drag that she does,
I've seen it before,
and it doesn't excite me.
I love Raja.
She's very fashion,
but sometimes
it's, like, a little bit
too, like, editorial.
Those are my cons first.
Get those out of the way
so I can end on a high note.
I'm kind of crazy
and a little unpredictable,
and I'm kind of stubborn
at times.
But I feel like I've proven
I can do almost anything.
So...I can be me for myself and
please other people.
- Alexis is a very, very
talented performer.
Cons: I don't really think
she thinks outside of the box.
Her marabou and her rhinestones
feels a little bit stagnant
to me.
It's always an entertaining
moment with Manila,
and I think that's awesome.
But Manila has a lot of growth
to do.
There's still a bit of
a template that she fits into.
I'm not really into templates.
- I want to ask you
about your pros and cons.
- For the first time in my life,
I can say
that I'm a beautiful person.
[tearfully]
It's taken a long time,
and it's been
a treacherous journey,
but I'm in this moment
right now,
and it feels so fucking great,
and I'm proud of it.
I'm very proud.
- Thank you, Raja.
While you and the other girls
enjoy an Absolut cocktail
in the Interior Illusions
Lounge,
the judges and I
will deliberate.
[engine starts]
Just between us girls, Manila.
She's amazing.
She can do everything.
- She is a knockout.
Her personality is fantastic.
If you're looking for somebody
to represent you
and<i> RuPaul's Drag Race,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
she's got
a wonderful stage presence
and can actually speak.
- I wanted to feel...
some sincerity.
She always stops herself
on an emotional level.
- I just happen to think
Manila is a superstar.
- And Manila has won
the last two challenges.
- She did.
- She's on a roll.
So let's move on to Alexis.
- You know how many times
I've counted her out?
- Tell me, how many times have
you counted her out?
- At least three or four times.
And then bam!
- Her Florida style of drag has
been considered, by many people,
to be too regional to be
America's next drag superstar.
- I never counted her out.
She is so authentic in what
she's bringing to the table
that I give her a free pass
on the over-the-top cha-cha.
- Her conviction is flawless.
Yeah, it's just flawless.
Let's move on to Raja.
- Sometimes I feel like she's
only worried
about the runway aspect
of the challenge.
- The bitch is bad.
- But does she do anything else
besides high fashion?
- Well, she won
three challenges.
- Yeah, she did.
- And she doesn't take herself
too seriously.
The bucket of blood,
remember that?
- Yeah, the<i> Carrie</i><span style="bodyStyle"> thing?</i>
- She takes genderfuck
and turns it into something
that's actually heightened and
intellectual and special.
- Her take on drag is very
different, very fresh and new.
- This is not going to be easy.
- All three of them are
superstars,
and they're all
equally as fierce.
- Silence!
This ain't over until they
lip-synch for their lives.
Bring back my girls.
Welcome back, ladies.
It all comes down to this.
Based on your performance
in the<i> Champion</i><span style="bodyStyle"> music video</i>
and your heroic work
throughout this competition,
I've made some decisions.
- [exhales]
This is it.
- Alexis Mateo...
your smile and spirit
remind us all
of the joy that drag brings
to the world.
It breaks my heart
to say this...
but you are not America's next
drag superstar.
Thank you, Alexis.
- [whispers] Thank you.
- Now...sashay away.
- Thank you.
[applause]
It doesn't matter
if I didn't won.
Knowing the things
that I have done in my life
to get to this point,
it feels wonderful.
The sky is the limit for me,
and this is just the beginning
for something wonderful.
The jig is up, bitches.
- Two beautiful queens
stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last
chance to impress me
and walk away with the title of
America's next drag superstar.
- My heart has never beat
faster in my life.
I felt like it was gonna jump
out of my chest.
- The time has come
for you to lip-synch...
for your life!
- I'm so excited.
It might be me that's the next
drag superstar.
So let's get this lip sync on.
- Good luck,
and for the last time,
don't fuck it up.
- I'm lip-synching the song
the way that I lip sync.
I'm lip-synching this as Manila.
- All eyes are on me,
and it's about me
really, really hitting it
and doing it Raja-style.
[song ends]
[applause]
- Wowza.
- Ho ho!
- Oh, I love you.
- Oh, my god!
- Ladies...
I've made my decision.
The winner
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race...</i>
America's next drag superstar,
is...
Raja.
[majestic music]
- Congratulations.
You were so good.
- Manila, you are
an inspiration.
I want to thank you
from the bottom of my heart.
- Thank you.
- Now...sashay away.
- I can't even explain
being so close
and then just not being able
to get there.
I don't think I could have done
anything differently.
I wouldn't have changed
this experience for anything.
I wouldn't have traded it
for anything.
And I'm happy how far I made it.
I'm first runner-up,
so if Raja dies of old age,
then maybe I'll get the crown.
- Raja, my queen...
I bow to thee.
- [laughs]
Along with this title,
I can use it now
to talk to kids who have no clue
that you could be a star.
I just want to let them know
that it's all right to be
a social misfit.
It's okay to think outside of
the box
and think greater than
what you know.
- Now, prance, I say.
Prance, my queen.
- All hail the queen!
[RuPaul's<i> Superstar]</i>
[cheers and applause]
- Bravo!
- Work, mama.
- Work it, baby!
- Yes!
- Grand prize contributed
in part by ALandCHUCK.travel.
- The crown is mine,
the cash is mine,
and I am America's next
drag superstar.
- And now the world premiere
of RuPaul's<i> Champion.</i>


- Oh, but, baby, you know how
I feel.
I mean, you really want me to
say it?
[laughing] This is silly.
Okay, here goes.
[imitating Cher]
Wagon wheel watusi!
[laughs]
You so crazy.
- Hey, Ru.
- Hey, Chaz.
I got that song,<i> Superstar.</i>
You know, the one you wanted to
rehearse for the show tonight.
- Oh, Chaz, I been so busy
selling the air rights to
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> I</i>
completely forgot it.
- Cool.
I-I can come in tomorrow.
- Well, no, no.
Let's just get it over with.
Okay, you want a spot?
- [imitating Cher]
Snap out of it!
What do you think, Chaz?
<i>Tonight, it's the superstar</i>
<i>edition of</i><span style="bodyStyle"> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
- Oh oh!
<i>- Get ready to gag, as we flash</i>
<i>back on this season's most</i>
<i>unforgettable moments.</i>
<i>Watch as this year's</i>
<i>queens bare</i>
<i>more than just their latex</i>
<i>boobies in never-before-seen,</i>
<i>up-close, and personal moments.</i>
<i>Join our extra-special guests,</i>
<i>Jujubee, Raven, and queen Tyra</i>
<i>as we count down the top ten</i>
<i>most sickening fits and</i>
<i>fashions.</i>
<i>Plus, outrageous outtakes</i>
<i>of our celebrity judges.</i>
- It's gonna be a bitch fight!
- [giggles]
<i>- With just one week until we</i>
<i>crown our new queen.</i>
<i>We salute our final three.</i>
<i>Alexis Mateo, Raja,</i>
<i>and Manila Luzon.</i>
Welcome to the superstar edition
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> chock</i>
<i>full of never-before-seen</i>
<i>footage for added freshness.</i>
<i>This season, none of our</i>
<i>showgirls threw marbles on the</i>
<i>runway, but they did have a few</i>
<i>catty things to say about each</i>
<i>other.</i>
Let's take a look.
- What did you think about
Shangela's Tina?
- Shangela's Tina was okay.
You know.
- Are you serious?
She looked like Tina Turner
after Ike beat her down.
- Was that my name?
- Yeah, we're talking about
Tina Turner, girl.
- This hair is not soundproof.
- When people are talking about
you, that means you're doing
something right.
What's more American than
Marilyn Monroe?
- Oh, my gosh, you don't look
anything like Marilyn Monroe.
You probably look like Marilyn
Manson.
[laughter]
- But not Marilyn Monroe.
- If, but--I'm not in drag, I'm
so quiet.
- You say you're quiet?
You're not quiet, bitch.
- You're not quiet.
- Who would you say is the
funniest person here?
- Like, who cracks me up the
most?
- Mm-hmm.
- I do.
I crack myself up all the time.
- No one ever gets your jokes
except for you.
- First of all, she look like a
fat ass, cheap Barbie doll from
the dollar store.
- [laughing] Damn.
- If you have nothing nice to
say, don't say anything at all.
But if you nothing nice to say,
come sit next to me.
- I like your shoes.
They're cute.
- [deep voice]
Thanks, Heather.
You guys have the most
a-softest voices for men.
- Well, that's because you sound
like James Earl Jones, honey.
- Oh, fuck off,
sprepper bitch.
- What do you think of Alexis'?
- Wow.
That's just gonna make her look
really thick in the middle.
- That is so ugly.
- I don't want to look like I've
been eating the cake.
- Raja, girl, listen, I'm gonna
give you a little bit of advice.
Don't ever walk into an antique
store.
They just might keep you, girl.
[laughter]
- I mean, even her skin is
rejecting the makeup.
It's like, some people are just
not meant to do it,
and if your skin is rejecting
the makeup...
- Your body is telling you
something.
- Your face looks so much
better; so much better.
- Uck, I know, 'cause before I
was painted like Carmen Carrera.
- No, before, bitch, you was
painted like a motherfucking
ghost, honey.
- Okay, the library's closed!
- Me-ow!
Speaking of mean girls, the
self-proclaimed popular queens,
led by Raja and Manila, formed
a secret clique called
the Heathers.
- She was fetch.
- Heather!
Stop trying to make "fetch"
work; it's not happening.
- They pitted themselves
against the rest of the girls,
who they lovingly referred to as
the boogers.
["valley girl" voice] Oh, my
god, don't you, like, totally
miss high school?
- Heather.
- Heather wants to talk to us.
- Come hither, Heather.
- Heather, what are you making?
- Carmen, Manila, Delta, and
myself have decided to call each
other Heather because we formed
this clique which looks a lot
like the movie<i> Heathers.</i>
- There's just Heathers and
boogers.
- Does anyone know why the
other girls are calling each
other Heather?
- I don't know.
- It's just retarded.
These dumb bitches.
- I love calling you Heather.
It's so much fun.
- How's your outfit going,
Heather?
- It's going gorgeous.
- So, Yara, are you still
friends with Shangela?
- Yes.
- We can make you a Heather,
but you can't talk to the other
boogaronis.
- No, I don't want to.
- I'm just kidding.
- Everybody's just playing a
game.
But I think they're going
overboard.
No, I would have never worked
with the Heathers.
- If anyone looks at us as being
a clique, it's just
because they're insecure.
- I don't know what they put in
the breakfast.
- Boogers.
- Relax.
- I'm so over them.
- We got this.
We're the Heathers.
- Thank you.
- Here at<i> RuPaul's Drag Race,</i>
we don't just entertain.
We "edjumacate."
And this season, our queens
taught us more new words than
Sarah Palin, although she may
refudiate that.
The first<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> word is...</i>
"busted."
- Everybody should have the
right to do drag, even if they
look busted.
- When it's not polished and
it's not there, it's just like,
bitch, it looks busted, and you
need to fix it.
- And you have to not be busted
like miss Raja over here.
- Crusted and busted.
- Busted people, they don't
know they're busted.
- Busted, party of one.
- [laughs]
- These other girls are busted.
- If you want to know the
truth, you need just one letter.
T.
- Ugh, I have so much T for you.
- What is the T?
- Here's the T.
- Just give me the T.
- There's the T.
- What's the T?
- She knows the T.
- You spilled your T to your
mom?
- How do you say, "that's the
T in Spanish?"
- [speaks Spanish]
- What?
- Oh, that is not the T.
- Some queens invented
their own catchphrases.
- Hallelu, ladies!
Hallelu!
He said hallelu.
- Hallelu!
- Hallelu.
- Hallelu.
- Is that a read?
- Hallelu, lelu.
- To quote Alexis Mateo, it
should say...
- Bam!
- Bam.
- Bam!
- Love the bam in all that
stuff.
- Bam!
- It was bam.
- Ah, thank you.
-<i> Echa, echa, echa pa'lante!</i>
- Help me say it.
-<i> Echa pa'lante.</i>
-<i> Echa pa'lante.</i>
-<i> Echa pa'lante.</i>
-<i> Echa pa'lante.</i>
- Darling, I have one thing to
say to you.
- And there were certain
expressions that seemed to get
stuck in all our heads.
Be a lady.
- Be a lady.
- Be a lady.
- "Don't be shady, be a lady."
- That bitch dances the house
down.
- He is going to ream me the
house down.
The house down is a drawn-out
version
of the exclamation point.
She is fierce, the house down.
- She is painted the house down.
- I'm padding the house down.
- I'm a diva, because a diva
delivers.
- Oh, so now you're delivering.
- Cannot walk.
- Oh, so, now you injured.
- It's really just the shoes.
- So now you're a drag queen?
- I can walk on water.
- Oh, so now you Jesus?
- [laughs]
- And then there's every drag
queen's favorite.
The f-word.
- Ooh, girl, you look fierce.
- I am fat, I am fierce.
- The reason you're here is
because you are fierce.
- It's like, "bitch, you look
fierce."
- Your Joan Crawford was not
Mildred fierce.
- You know there are some fierce
bitches here.
- She's one fierce mothertucker.
- But I think I did a fierce job
today.
- We're not here to be shady,
just fierce.
And what do you call something
that's fiercer than fierce?
You call it sickening.
- I am what? Sickening.
- Sickening.
- It was sickening to break him
in, honey.
- And by sickening, she means
sending people to the hospital.
- That's when it's, like,
sickening, girl.
- My thing is glamour and being
sickening.
- Thank you.
- One day, Alexis Mateo, I will
be as sickening as you.
- Sickening, no?
- Hi, and welcome back to the
superstar edition of
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
Now, here to help me count down
the most sickening fits and
fashions, I've invited three
legendary children.
Yes, legendary.
Welcome back the tasty Jujubee.
The mistress Raven.
And America's reigning drag
superstar, miss Tyra Sanchez.
Well, hello, my queens.
- Hey, Ru.
- Hey, mama.
- Welcome back.
- Thank you for having us.
- [laughs]
- Now, ladies...
let's count down the most
sickening fits and fashions on
the runway.
Coming in at number ten,
Manila Luzon
and her fluffy Christmas muff.
- Ooh.
- Look at the size of that muff.
I think she looks like this
exotic Russian model.
She looks absolutely
breathtaking.
- Manila Luzon, you have a muff
to die for.
- I think she looks fabulous.
I mean, I want that outfit for
myself.
It might be the only muff I put
my hands in.
It's cute.
- Coming at number nine
is Yara Sofia's
twisted follicle fantasy.
- I loved it.
The purse is my favorite.
It was, like, very hot.
- Yeah, she puts it together.
- This thing, though, I don't
know how that stayed on her
head.
- I think she looked like
a couture poodle.
Giving you hair body.
Ruff.
[laughter]
- All right, girls, coming in
at number eight, the ambush of
Shangela.
Who do you think should go home
tonight?
- I would like to see Shangela
go.
She's just a loudmouth, and
she's always talking, and
halleluing.
- Shangela, although your
personality shines, I think you
should be on season five or six.
That's where you should be.
- You know, you three have all
been in the workroom with
Shangela before.
- Yes.
- Is she annoying, Jujubee?
- I don't think she's annoying
at all.
She cracked me up.
- Yeah?
- I was mad when she left.
I wanted to see more of her.
So I think it was great that
she's back.
- Do you think that was fair
what Manila and Raja said to
Shangela?
- Well, I think everyone's
entitled to their own opinion,
but it just reminded me of the
wedding episode.
So I felt like how Shangela
felt.
They're entitled to say what
they want to say.
I think they could have said it
in a more polite way.
- In your case or in Shangela's
case?
- In both cases.
- [laughs]
- I'm sorry.
- In our number seven spot,
it's our cheerleading jocks in
frocks.
They've got spirit, yes they do.
They've got spirit.
How 'bout you?
- Whoo!
- Baby!
- Wrap your dick!
Wrap up your dick!
- No bareback! No bareback!
- Abstinence is for boogers,
but we love our diaphragm!
- Protection is the key!
Safe sex!
- These are some ladies.
- Well, one of 'em looked like
Juju.
- Okay, she was giving you body.
- Yeah.
- She was giving shoulders,
girl.
- Whatever.
- Raja was my favorite.
It reminded me so much
of<i> White Chicks</i>
when they started dancing.
It was just hilarious.
- I love Yara Sofia trying to
spell out the word "wrap," and
every letter, it sounds like
she's gonna say a different
letter.
- Give me the A!
- A!
- Give me the ah-a!
- A!
- Their performance was one of
the funniest things I've seen on
national television in a long,
long time.
- Safe sex, motherfuckers!
- Wrap that dick!
- Coming in at number six is
Raja from the lost tribe of
supermodels.
- Fabulous fierce.
I wish I had her body, for real.
There needs to be a time when
you can go, "okay, I'm gonna
rough it up and make this a
little edgy."
I wanna see that bitch do
<i>Avatar.</i>
-<i> Dragatar.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
- Yes.
- At number five, Alexis
Mateo's eye-popping,
jaw-dropping outfit from
the drag queens of comedy.
- I'm a Latina girl, and I only
have two options in this
country.
And you all know I didn't came
here to clean toilets, baby, so
I became a stripper, baby!
- I love big titties.
[laughter]
- Actually, last season,
I think you were the only queen
who had a breast plate.
- Mm-hmm.
- This season, several of the
girls were pumping breast
plates.
Is that a trend that's happening
around the world right now?
- Um, I've noticed that,
wherever I go now, there are
a lot of queens with it now.
It comes to the point where,
like, I don't even wear it as
much anymore because--
- Are you pumping the breast
plate now?
- No. No.
- Just natural.
- Just natural.
- [laughs]
Making the number four spot
on our countdown is the gift
that keeps on giving...
Carmen Carrera's ass.
- I think clothing repels off of
her.
You know?
I'm like, "girl, did you get
that half off?"
- My dick would be really mad
as--
I don't know where she put it.
- Pissed off.
- She's got some skills.
- Yeah.
- In your group, Raven, were
there any girls who were naked
like that?
- I think the only one that
came close to that was Mystique.
- Yeah.
I'm kidding.
[laughter]
- Coming in at number three is
Shangela, serving some
post-modern pimp realness.
- Well, you know I had a dumbass
girlfriend.
She came screaming at me last
week, talkin' about, "Laquifa!"
I said, "what?!"
"Where your hoes at?"
I said, "bitch, don't you see
I'm wearin' four pair of hose
right here
holding back my dick!"
- That bitch is hilarious.
I can watch that over and over
again.
- It was very well thought out.
Everything that she did.
The way she puts her hand on
her, "I'm also my own ho."
I absolutely loved it.
- Coming in at number two on
the most sickening fits and
fashions involves miss India
Ferrah getting a bit carried
away.
- If that were me, if that was
me carried away...
Mimi would have been
drop-kicked.
- Uh-oh.
- I would have got kung fu on
her.
- Okay.
- Yes, ma'am.
It crosses a line, and it shows
your desperation.
- First and foremost,
be a lady.
- Keep it cute.
- Keep it cute.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Now, what would you have done
in that situation?
- Well, it's $75,000 that
you're giving away, and you
don't want to go home.
You want to be there and you
want to win.
So, in her mind, she's thinking,
"I can't go home.
I cannot go home."
- But I will say India handled
it very well.
When she was finally put down,
she did her thing.
I will say props to India.
And I love India's mug.
- And now, the moment we've all
been waiting for, the coveted
number one spot on our
countdown.
The most sickening of them all
goes to...
Who could it be?
Isn't anybody gonna interrupt
me?
- Hold on, now, Ru.
The top spot belongs to...
- Ahggh...
- You!
- Me?! What?
What are you talking about?
Are you telling me that I'm
number one three years in a row?
- Three years in a row.
- Is that a record?
Susan Lucci, eat your heart out.
- My favorite was
your Barbie look.
You came out and you were like,
"okay."
- Valley girl.
- Oh, yes.
- Where I was going as a black
woman for the first time in my
life.
I was portraying a black woman.
- You nailed it.
- Do you think so?
- Did a really good job.
- Oh, good, thank you.
Thank you.
Raven, what was your favorite
look?
- The one where you're in the
black and yellow dress.
- That's the glamazon with the
Mohawk story going.
- Yes.
- It was gorgeous.
- And, Tyra, what about me?
What about RuPaul?
What I want to know is what
dress would you want to mock?
- It's like a peach color.
- Yeah, it's got the dandelion
big--
- All over, I think I'd want to
mock that one.
- Very ra-cha-cha.
[laughter]
Well, thank you, ladies.
I know you'll be watching next
week to find out who gets
crowned America's next drag
superstar.
Thank you for chiming in.
Lots of luck.
Welcome back to the superstar
edition of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
Now, to reach the final three,
Alexis, Manila, and Raja had to
really pump up the volume.
Because the ten queens who left
before them did not go quietly.
- Hello.
all: Hi!
<i>- Now, we barely got to</i>
<i>know Venus D-Lite.</i>
<i>A fierce Madonna</i>
<i>impersonator...</i>
<i>Venus found her holiday was cut</i>
<i>short, and quicker than a ray</i>
<i>of light, she was gone.</i>
The next queen to fly the coop
was Phoenix.
After an awkward first
impression, her psychic ability
made her team captain.
- Action!
- You've arrived in a
hermaphrodite spaceship.
Prepare to trannyport in three,
two, one.
- Phoenix, you're delivering
all your lines away from the
camera.
We need to see your gorgeous
face.
- Okay.
- I think you could have been a
little zanier, especially with a
name like Lady Tata.
<i>- But even Phoenix couldn't</i>
<i>predict that her performance as</i>
<i>Lady Tata would make her the</i>
<i>second queen to leave the race.</i>
Mimi Imfurst...
- Welcome to my party!
I brought cookies.
<i>- Got off to a rocky start.</i>
<i>Her confidence was shaken when</i>
<i>she tried to put the "merry"</i>
back in Christmas.
- [crying] I don't know what I
was thinking.
And if I have to lip-synch,
I'll
motherfucking lip-synch my life
off.
<i>- But her lively personality</i>
<i>soon came busting out all over.</i>
Much to the annoyance of some of
the other girls.
- Action.
- Aah!
- Miss Mimi, there's a
difference in being talented...
and being a showboat.
<i>- Her performance from</i>
Queens from Uranus<i> received</i>
<i>some stellar reviews.</i>
But her workout video proved to
be more pain than gain.
- You gotta get higher!
Chase after your man!
You're gonna grab him!
- Oh!
- Hold him up!
- Cut! It's just feeling a
little disorganized.
- It was hokey.
It was not good.
<i>- And her lip-synch with India</i>
<i>Ferrah got way too physical.</i>
- Get her off of me!
<i>- And Mimi Imfurst was the</i>
<i>third queen to go home.</i>
India Ferrah arrived from Ohio
with an all-star reputation.
- Girl...prison, honey.
I look over to Phoenix copying
my style, so I actually had to
go up to her and be a little
cunt to her.
I love your hair.
<i>- India's rubber boobies became</i>
<i>stars in their own right.</i>
- I thought they were just
completely believable.
- But the judges wanted to see
more than just jiggle.
- Give me more face.
- Okay.
- Give me more of that.
- There is a hell no storm.
Okay?
<i>- Her performance as the QNN</i>
<i>weather girl was met with an</i>
<i>arctic blast, and India was the</i>
<i>fourth to sashay away.</i>
This next lady boy served fish
like she was working at Red
Lobster, and we call this queen
Mariah.
- Prepare to gag on my eleganza.
<i>- One of the most flawless</i>
<i>beauties to ever grace the</i>
<i>runaway.</i>
<i>Mariah's poise and</i>
<i>self-confidence seemed like it</i>
<i>would carry her far.</i>
- When we find out that we have
to go out during the daytime and
go shopping in drag, I'm good,
'cause, baby, if it's right,
it's right.
<i>- And in the snatch game, her</i>
<i>impression of Joan Crawford did</i>
not earn her the respect she
felt entitled to.
- Now, that is not a wire
hanger.
- It's not.
- What is it?
- It's a wooden hanger.
[all groan]
<i>- And that led to the</i>
<i>emancipation of Mariah.</i>
It's safe to say that Stacy
Layne Matthews has put
Back Swamp, North Carolina, on
the map.
Her clone does not sleep alone.
- You look so much
like my relatives.
Is she related and I don't know
it?
- The back swamp Jacksons.
- Shake it! Ohh!
- Excellent.
- Yes! Mmm!
<i>- But Stacy's personality,</i>
<i>humor,</i>
<i>and star quality soon emerged.</i>
- Okay.
- Monique?
- Precious!
- Uh-oh.
Is Precious back there?
- Mm-hmm.
Bitch knows I'm hungry as hell.
- Eventually, the pressure of
competition started to get to
Stacy.
<i>And even her red velvet cake</i>
<i>ensemble wasn't sweet enough to</i>
<i>keep her in the competition.</i>
Delta work arrived here as one
of the girls to beat.
- Delta, you better...
- And I'm Delta Work.
Pour yourself another cup of
ambition
because this is the Morning
After News.
- Looking sexy.
- So do you. I love you in pink.
- Thanks.
- And, darling, we're done.
- Oh! Cool!
- [laughs]
- We won't be able to get you
to put clothes on anymore.
- No, I don't think so.
Carmen Carrera better watch out.
- [laughs]
<i>Her ability to make us laugh</i>
kept her in the competition week
after week.
- One, two, three. Like that!
You see how that feels?
Do it like that!
You've got enough, you can stick
it right down inside there.
And you can jump up and down.
<i>- But in the end, it was her</i>
<i>stand-up comedy routine</i>
<i>that got</i>
<i>her eliminated.</i>
Jersey princess Carmen Carrera
flaunted a figure
that wouldn't quit.
- Hey, hey.
- Carmen Carrera is like the
flyest girl you're ever gonna
meet in your life.
- She's an ass-tronaut.
- I make sure that her body is
flawless.
If you find the flaw, let me
know.
- Hey.
No foam here.
- 100% made in the USA.
- Ohh!
<i>- Her reggae version of</i>
Superstar
<i>didn't make the sun splash</i>
<i>she wanted it to.</i>
<i>- But in a</i><span style="bodyStyle"> Drag Race</i><i> first,</i>
the judges later overruled
my decision.
- I can't.
I don't wanna look.
Ohh!
[cheers and jeers]
- I'm back, bitches.
both: Uh-oh, she said
my pussy's turning red.
- Ooh!
both: No burn, limpy.
Protection is the key!
<i>- Unable to turn her jock into</i>
<i>a convincing drag sister,</i>
<i>Carmen</i>
<i>was sent home...again.</i>
<i>This time for good.</i>
This season started with a big
surprise.
- Hallelu, ladies!
[cheers and applause]
- What the fuck?
- Ohh!
- But it turns out the surprise
was on Shangela when her snowman
couture put her in the bottom
two in the first week.
both: Stop flirting!
You stop flirting!
Ohh!
<i>- She rocketed back, winning</i>
<i>the next challenge with her</i>
<i>twin bot, Alexis Mateo.</i>
[imitating Cher] Shangela.
It's the drive I saw in Shangela
that kept her fighting when her
back was up against the wall.
- I said, "bitch, better have
my money!"
You pick up the hallelula hoop
and you put it back around your
waist!
And you work the hallehula hoop.
One, two, three, four.
I don't want that whore no more.
Five, six, seven, eight.
I am gonna find a date.
<i>- But even her irrepressible</i>
<i>hallelu spirit couldn't carry</i>
<i>Shangela into the final three.</i>
Yara Sofia arrived from
Puerto Rico as a dark horse
in this competition.
- Oh oh!
Oh, almost burned my ass.
Oh, my god.
Cha! Cha!
<i>Echa pa'lante!</i>
<i>- But her sense of humor and</i>
<i>her</i>
<i>joy for life proved to be</i>
<i>contagious in challenge...</i>
- Ohh!
<i>- After challenge.</i>
- Hyuh! [raspberry]
Get out! Get out! Get out!
Get out! Get out!
Get out, get out, get out!
- Let me hear some of your
English accent.
[laughter]
- Can I have some whater?
[laughter]
How'd it sound?
- By George, I think you've got
it!
- Ohh, rheally?
- Yes!
<i>But, forced to lip-synch for</i>
<i>her life against her good</i>
<i>friend</i>
<i>Alexis Mateo, Yara seemed to</i>
<i>throw in the towel too early.</i>
<i>- I'm so angry, and I'm so</i>
<i>disappointed.</i>
<i>I'm a mess.</i>
<i>- Sadly, we had to say adios.</i>
I'm so proud of each of these
incredible queens.
They made this competition the
stiffest one yet and really
forced our final three to earn
their place at the top.
Welcome back to the superstar
edition of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
<i>This year, the judge's panel</i>
<i>was star-studded.</i>
- [laughs]
- But you didn't get to see
half of what goes on behind that
table until now.
Like when my best girlfriend
Michelle Visage and I start
kicking, things can get real
stupid.
- Seeing India tonight on the
runway was like walking into the
mall,
and Claire's exploded all over
her.
- Well, I want to see you do me;
how would you do me?
[laughs]
Michelle, sashay away.
- Ohh.
- You know, my personal mantra
is, it's not a party until
someone gets a bucket of pig
blood dumped on her head.
- Oh, that's mine too.
Mm, it smells like freedom
in here.
- Ooh, I thought I washed.
- [laughs]
The boy judges had their manic
moments too between Santino,
Billy B., and Mike Ruiz--
child, nobody was safe.
- She always looks beautiful,
but she looks like a beautiful
special needs child.
[laughter]
- And we love special needs
children.
- Some of you who do have very
feminine features still contour
the crap out of it, and you look
like Lil Kim before she went to
the doctor.
- Oh! Oh, oh!
- I'm just saying.
- You need to get
a refrigerator,
because you're going sour.
- Am I wilting?
- There's some fruit flies
buzzing around your head.
- Now, Billy, is it possible
that you are pregnant right now
and you don't know it?
- My shoes are wet.
I think my water just broke.
[laughter]
- You did this funny thing with
your lips when you were doing
the runway, this puckering
thing.
It looks like you were--
suck the
paint off a Cadillac
with those lips.
- Your...pie looked delicious.
And not the one you were
holding, heh heh!
In a whole constellation of
asses,
she's got the brightest ass.
- Thank you very much, Albert
Einstein.
Santa Claus, please, keep it
quiet.
Thank you, Phil Donahue.
Now, my favorite part of the
show is watching our celebrity
guest judges, who are really
just big fans, get caught up in
the spirit of drag race.
And nobody goes home until
they've strutted their stuff on
the runway.
Don't be jealous of their
boogie.
- Not only can the judges walk
the walk,
they talk the talk too.
Here is some never-before-seen
footage to show you just what I
mean.
- I think it's extraordinary.
You look like Paris Hilton if
she was the Motel 6 heiress.
[laughter]
- I think Santa has Venus envy.
[laughter]
- It looks like ladies' night at
the Star Wars cantina.
Are you feeling intergalactic?
- Very intergalactic.
- That's so funny, because I'm
interga-lactating right now.
- Are you?
- Because that is the real T,
this girl, okay?
If you could put a pair of
trousers and a blazer and look
feminine, hon'ty, you deserve to
snatch several daytime Emmys,
okay?
- The walk, however.
It's like you do have a horse
between your legs.
- Apparently, he does.
- Your smile is absolutely
lovely.
- 15 years since I've been to
the dentist.
I just brush and floss.
- What?
- But you just take 'em out and
put 'em in a glass at night,
right?
- The biggest career move I ever
did was
to have my teeth removed.
- Exactly.
- Choking on chicken in an
exercise video is not good.
- It's not cute.
It's not cute for her.
- But choking on chicken in
private or choking your chicken.
- Choking anybody's chicken is
not cute
if it's on camera.
- I think your dress goes with
the whole India theme.
Sari.
- Sorry seems to be the
hardest...dress to wear.
- Yeah.
It is, it is.
- Smizing got out of control.
The smizing was--it's like gonna
be the next version of<i> Saw.</i>
Like,<i> Saw 10: The Smize.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
- Smize 5.
- Oh, I'm gettin' daggers!
I'm gonna cut you and she's
gonna cut me.
It's gonna be a bitch fight!
- You know, there's something
about<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> that</i>
frees up our judges to let it
all hang out.
Maybe a little too far out.
- If you haven't noticed, I'm
like a bald-headed ho.
I don't have any hair at all.
- That's the cake I would've
wanted
when I was like eight and having
my princess birthday party,
so I guess when I was eight, I
wanted a gay wedding cake.
Which makes sense.
- I want that shrug so bad.
- This one?
- I want to roll around in it.
I want to see it first thing in
the morning.
I want to nuzzle it.
- The thing that I didn't like
was, like, I felt like she had a
bouquet of flowers in her hair.
- What's wrong with flowers in
her hair?
- And it was really distracting.
- Will you look at Ru?
- Yeah, I've got a bouquet of
flowers here.
- Ru's got a damn florist,
not a bouquet.
- I got a lot going on.
- You're more fresh than a
hibiscus bush.
- I got some birds.
I had some snakes.
- I'm gonna have an apple in a
minute.
[laughter]
- Did you bake that cake in your
lovin' oven?
- What? I'm sorry?
[laughter]
Never mind.
Judges, you have not been a help
at all.
- Sorry.
- Two-time guest judge, the
luminous La Toya Jackson, has a
giggle that is both magical and
infectious.
Before long, she had everybody
doing the toy-toy titter.
Hee hee hee hee!
- [giggling]
[laughter]
[giggling]
Am I wrong for saying that?
- How about that La Toya
Jackson?
- Hee hee hee hee hee!
- Are you recording this?
[giggling]
[all mocking La Toya's laugh]
- I'm drinking champagne!
Hee hee hee hee!
- [giggles]
Stop it.
- Welcome back to the superstar
edition of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
<i>Now, there's more to drag</i>
<i>queens than meets the eye.</i>
<i>Beneath all the padding,</i>
<i>glitter, and false eyelashes,</i>
lady boys need love too.
- I've had a boyfriend
for ten years.
- I want to be with my husband
for ten years.
It's been more than three years.
- The thing about a
relationship, and plus, you're
a drag queen; I mean, you gotta
just be ready for anything,
you know?
- Well, the thing is that he
gets a two-for-one with Carmen,
you know what I mean, so...
there's no complaints.
- Are you missing your husband
at all?
- Yes, I miss him, girl.
- Are you?
- And I know he's missing me.
Like, I guess that's the hardest
part of--that I know, like, what
he's going through.
You know, he loves me to death.
He would do anything for me.
He goes to all my shows.
Helps me, dresses me.
- Oh, how cool.
- It's so difficult for us in
this business to actually meet
somebody.
- Oh, yes.
- That's why you have to date
another drag queen.
- Yes!
- It's nice, because, like, you
understand each other.
And you double your wardrobe.
[laughter]
- When it comes to seeing their
son in high heels and a dress,
some parents just don't
understand.
But our brave and talented
queens have learned to carry on.
- Yara, has your family ever
come to see you perform?
- My mother, the thing she
doesn't get it is she thinks
that I'm a stripper.
- Well, you kind of are.
- She doesn't get that
we lip-sync and we do
[indistinct],
you know what I mean?
She doesn't get it.
- I think Yara's a stripper.
[laughs]
- Hey, Shangela, has your
grandmother ever seen you
perform?
- She loved it, she was like,
"I couldn't believe it.
You look like a woman.
I said, 'That's not DJ.
That's a white woman.'"
- Home is where the love is.
And some of our queens have
created new families, with drag
mothers and drag sisters that
make the world a more fabulous
place to live.
- You guys have houses.
- Mm-hmm, houses.
- What does that mean?
Like a family?
- It's kind of like
fraternities and sororities.
But with gay culture.
Most of our house names are
after designers.
- Okay.
- So it's like you have the
house of Balenciaga, the house
of Chanel, the house of...
so many others.
- What house are you in?
- Balenciaga.
- The Balenciaga.
- Balenciaga. Okay.
- I miss my drag family.
I mean, I see my family...
I call them my family 'cause
they really are my drag family.
But more than that, they're my
friends.
And I see them and talk to them
every day, all day long.
Even if we're not working.
- Exactly.
So really just family.
- Let's do this; let's do that.
- Before I did drag, I used to
go watch Raja's shows.
So she's like my unofficial
drag mother.
- Okay.
- Amen and hallelu.
Now, coming out is different for
everybody.
Some queens don't put it
together until later in life.
And others, well...they just
seem to be born that way.
- When I came out of the womb,
I came out.
So it was just a matter of my
parents having to learn
and deal with it, you know?
- I grew up in a very ignorant
place.
We got, like, one gay kid a
year.
- Were you that one gay kid in
your class?
- I was the one gay kid that
everyone probably suspected.
I can remember, like, in
kindergarten, I was in catholic
school...and I would just like
go up to boys and kiss them.
- Believe me, if we were in
kindergarten together, I would
let you kiss me.
- [laughs]
- So, miss Phoenix, girl, we
both are from Georgia.
Was it as unpleasant for you as
it was for me?
- I remember, like, in high
school, somebody getting pegged
in the head with a Coke can,
'cause he was gay.
- Girl, shut up.
- And...
- They, ooh, they were--
- Yeah, I was like, "absolutely
not."
I'm like, "whatever is going on
with me..."
- Is gonna be with me.
- It's gonna be with me.
I'm not telling another
motherfucker.
One of my best friends, he kind
of like helped me come out, and
he actually is the one that
helped me get started in drag,
so...
- Oh, word.
- Yeah, I mean, he, like, kind
of showed me there is, like,
another world out there.
- Thank god.
- I'd take my friends to lunch
and be like, "um, okay.
So I have something to tell you.
And, as you know, I've gone on
dates with girls, but also I
have gone on dates with guys."
And then I'd just pause and wait
for the reaction.
And every time, everyone went,
"oh, I knew."
And I was like, "oh."
- I didn't come out.
My mom caught me.
- What do you mean she caught
you?
- Wait, wait, wait.
Your mom caught you doing what?
- I called my neighbor, and I
was doing my thing, and then my
mom opened the door, heh.
And I was there...
- Alexis, what's your coming out
story?
- It was horrible.
- How?
- I decided to have an
experience with a man.
He used to pick me up at school.
I got really scared, 'cause
everybody started saying that I
was gay and all this bullshit.
So I cut off relationship
thingy,
and he wrote a letter to my mom.
- [gasps]
- I walk in my house, and my
mom was sitting at the table,
and she said to me, "put your
backpack in your room.
I need to talk to you."
The jig was up.
- Welcome back to the superstar
edition of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
In just one week, one of these
queens--Manila Luzon, Raja, or
Alexis Mateo--will be crowned
America's next drag superstar
and walk away with a lifetime
supply
<i>of Kryolan professional</i>
<i>makeup...</i>
<i>headline logo's</i><span style="bodyStyle"> Drag Race</i><i> tour,</i>
<i>featuring cocktails perfected</i>
<i>by Absolut,</i>
<i>and win a cash prize of 75,000.</i>
Let's take a look back at the
special blend of charisma,
uniqueness, nerve, and talent
that make these three queens the
cream of the crop.
Manila Luzon had a unique
insight coming
into this competition.
- My drag persona Manila is my
personal muse, because I inspire
myself.
During the day as a boy, I'm a
graphic designer.
And my job does affect my drag
because it really helps me put
together a visual story that I
want to communicate to the
audience.
- Her comedic abilities made
the judges laugh in challenge
after challenge after challenge.
- Manila, you're all ears, girl.
[laughter]
- Manila proved that there's
more to her than just comedy.
She brought originality and
served up high glamour.
<i>- Drag, to me, is creatively</i>
<i>bringing together an entire</i>
<i>story and costumes and</i>
<i>character</i>
and putting them
into one living being.
That's the best part.
<i>- A world-class queen</i>
<i>with beauty, brains,</i>
<i>and a bright persona,</i>
Manila just might have what it
takes to be
America's next drag superstar.
Christmas came early for
Southern California native Raja,
winning both challenges her
first week here.
- Oh, no stranger to the runway.
<i>- I've always been a drag</i>
<i>queen.</i>
<i>To me, it's just like</i>
<i>breathing.</i>
<i>I've always loved fashion and I</i>
<i>do drag because I don't believe</i>
<i>that only women are allowed to</i>
<i>wear beautiful, fashionable</i>
<i>things.</i>
<i>- Her high fashion</i>
<i>sensibilities, unexpected</i>
<i>choices, and incredible makeup</i>
<i>artistry kept Raja at the top</i>
<i>of the class.</i>
<i>- I love iconic people</i>
<i>within fashion.</i>
<i>A little coo coo, a little</i>
<i>berserk, a little funny,</i>
<i>a little eccentric--that's my</i>
<i>style; that's my fashion</i>
reference that I look to.
I don't care to look like
a Kardashian.
<i>Raja is cultural.</i>
<i>She's smart.</i>
<i>She's adventurous.</i>
<i>She definitely thinks</i>
<i>outside of the box.</i>
And she's genderless.
She's raceless
and she's ageless.
- Raja isn't just fierce.
She proved that she's versatile,
intelligent,
and isn't afraid to act the
fool.
- No one can hear your
lip-synching in space.
Prepare to die!
<i>- Raja is definitely at the top</i>
<i>of her game.</i>
<i>But will her many talents take</i>
<i>her to the top of the heap?</i>
Straight out of central Florida
comes Alexis Mateo.
Bam.
- Hi, my name is Alexis Mateo
Rodriguez Rivera Elizabeth
<i>y todos los demas.</i>
[laughter]
Bam! Bam!
- Cha-cha.
<i>- A Puerto Rican pageant queen</i>
<i>whose beauty and positive</i>
<i>attitude are captivating.</i>
<i>- I grew up doing pageants.</i>
And it's always about how
flawless
and how perfect you are.
So I guess, in the back of my
mind, I'm always trying to be
completely pageant-ready.
- Behind her big smile,
we learned a story of pain
and loss.
Do you know anybody
in the military?
- [sighs]
Three years ago, I met somebody
very special in my life.
We get our relationship very
secretly.
And, like, the best moments of
my life was with him.
And he got called to go to
service,
and I don't know nothing
about him
since like a year and a half.
So I really don't know
if he's okay.
- What would you say to him
right now?
- I want to say I'm sorry and
that I love him so much
and that I am very proud of him.
- Alexis Mateo, you turned
sadness into gladness
and made us proud.
Condragulations, you are
the winner of this challenge.
- Thank you.
- Is there anything
you'd like to say?
- I know some things
happen in life.
It teaches you a lot of valuable
lessons.
And this one helped me to grow,
'cause I normally depend a lot
from people.
And I want to say thank you to
that special person that showed
me that I needed to love myself
first.
<i>The best part of being a drag</i>
<i>queen--have the chance to be</i>
a star and be the center of
attention for a second.
<i>When I'm Alexis Mateo,</i>
<i>I think I'm perfect.</i>
<i>In my eyes, Alexis Mateo is the</i>
most beautiful drag queen
in the world.
[cheers and applause]
Bam!
- Alexis proves the winning
power of perseverance.
And that is a quality of
a champion, honey.
So there you have it.
Are you team Manila?
Team Raja?
Or team Alexis?
All three are fierce
competitors.
But only one can be
the champion.
Tune in next week, when we crown
America's next drag superstar
on the grand finale of<i> </i>
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
And remember,
if you can't love yourself,
how in the hell you gonna love
somebody else?
Can I get a amen in here?
- Amen!
- Let the music play!
<i>Grand prize contributed</i>
<i>in part by ALandCHUCK.travel.</i>


<i>- Previously on</i>
RuPaul's Drag Race...
- Her name is Mimi Imfurst,
but she's not first.
And I don't even think
she's second.
[exclamations]
- Alexis and I, as the twinbots,
we delivered.
both: Dragonauts away.
<i>- All right, Miss Raja.</i>
<i>- India Ferrah.</i>
<i>Her clone does not sleep alone.</i>
<i>Mimi Imfurst.</i>
<i>- I think that I stand a good</i>
<i>chance of winning this one.</i>
- Oh, damn the rules.
Let's call it a tie.
Shangela, Alexis,
you've won this challenge.
- Ooh!
- Delta Work, Shante, you stay.
Phoenix, sashay away.
<i>And tonight...</i>
It's time to get
totally leotarded.
[exclamations]
<i>The dolls get physical.</i>
- Feel it.
- [laughs]
<i>And it ain't always pretty.</i>
- Whoo-whoo-whoo.
<i>- And extra-special</i>
<i>guest judges</i>
<i>fitness guru Susan Powter</i>
<i>and Latoya Jackson.</i>
<i>The winner of</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
RuPaul's Drag Race
<i>will receive a lifetime supply</i>
<i>of Kryolan professional makeup,</i>
<i>headline Logo's</i><span style="bodyStyle"> Drag Race</i><i> tour,</i>
<i>featuring cocktails perfected</i>
<i>by Absolut,</i>
<i>and a cash prize of $75,000.</i>
And may the best woman win.
- Eh.
- Poor Phoenix.
- Delta, you got rid of her.
- Oh, she said boots.
Phoenix is gone, and it's a new
day, it's a new challenge,
and I feel totally reenergized.
Raja, get ready to write
your name on here later.
[laughter]
- We won, girl.
- I'm a little surprised that
Shangela and Alexis won.
I think that I sort of went
a little outside the box
and was a little more sci-fi.
I felt like I got really close
to winning
the first challenge too.
- Mimi really does think
that Mimi's first.
- I mean, it's hard.
It's like, you know, you don't
want to be second best.
You want to be best.
- Really, I just didn't wanna
hear her talk.
<i>[alarm blares]</i>
<i>- Ooh!</i>
<i>Girl, you've got she-mail.</i>
<i>Hello, drag stars.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
all: Hi.
<i>- If you wanna win this race,</i>
<i>you've gotta feel the burn.</i>
<i>So stretch, bend over,</i>
<i>and take it</i>
<i>like America's</i>
<i>next drag superstar.</i>
<i>Let me hear your body talk.</i>
<i>And remember...</i>
- Ow!
<i>- No pain, no gain.</i>
<i>[laughing]</i>
- Oh, my god.
- Ooh, girl.
- Oh, my god.
- Let me hear your body talk.
- Girl, you don't wanna hear
what this one has to say.
[laughter]
- Well, we just lost, girl.
I just lost.
- Hello, hello, hello!
all: Hey.
- Do you know what time it is?
It's time to get leotarded.
- Oh.
- In this bag is a drag queen's
best friend
and worst kept secret...
duct tape.
all: Oh.
- Now for today's
mini-challenge, you'll become
drag MacGyvers to customize
a sporty fashion leotard using
only these rolls of duct tape.
But first, you'll need
to split up into groups of two
and one group of three.
- Delta, Stacy.
- Immediately, Mimi decides it
needs to be
the three
plus-sized queens together.
- You three here? Okay.
- The last thing I wanna do is
be on a team with Mimi.
Like, that's the last thing that
I wanna do.
- Ready?
Steady...
Tape!
[shrieking]
- Whatever I 'm doing to you
in pink, you do to me in purple.
Carmen and I have a bunch
of neon colors.
And so our idea is to do, like,
a super '80s,
kinda '90s workout leotard.
Girl, my tuck.
- Whoo!
- Sorry, I didn't mean to touch
your dick.
- Don't worry.
- Alexis and I came up with the
concept of corsets, bustiers,
with a little bit of ruffle.
- Whoo, sister,
you got me together.
Hallelu.
Good thing I didn't need
those ribs.
Get up in there.
Ow, ow.
- This looks like a trash bag,
completely.
I mean, it really looks bad.
This is a disaster.
This looks horrible, and we're
completely mismanaging the time.
- Start over?
- Yeah.
- Get over here.
Come here, Stace.
- Sorry.
- We ought to tape these
into your ear.
- Your braid.
- Oh, my god!
I love it, I gotta wear it.
- One, two, three, go.
They're not gonna close.
The boots aren't gonna close.
- Oh, shit,
something just popped.
- Okay, ladies, time's up.
Wow.
Ooh-wee, y'all are leotarded.
Let's see how
my designing queens did.
Alexis and Mariah...
Category is duct tape.
- Alexis and I,
our outfits came out nice.
I feel good about what we did,
and I might even save it
for later.
- Let them have it.
Next up, Yara and Raja.
Letting them have it
in a<i> Flashdance</i><span style="bodyStyle"> effect.</i>
Carmen and Manila...
she's wearing
her duct tape iPod.
- We're giving fierce
jazzercise realness.
- Yes, ooh, la-la.
Shangela and India,
serving desert storm.
Yes, she's looking
for a few good men.
Last but not least,
Stacy, Delta, and Mimi...
The Supremes are back.
- There were parts
of the leotard
that didn't fit properly.
Everyone in the room
is looking at me,
and it's a really
uncomfortable feeling.
- Okay...
[laughing]
- That whole group
with Mimi, Delta, and Stacy
looked like two sisters
that had gotten pulled
into a girl group that they
didn't wanna be a part of.
- Okay, gym bunnies...
Now I've seen your leotarded
outfits, and...
The winning team is
Manila and Carmen.
- Ah! Wheeee!
- Condragulations, ladies.
Come on up.
Do you know what time it is now?
It's time
to get totally leotarded!
- Oh!
[applause]
- Now, a great drag queen knows
how important it is
to keep her charisma,
uniqueness, nerve,
and talent in tip-top shape.
So for this week's main
challenge, you are going to
produce your very own
inspirational workout videos.
[applause]
Yes.
Now, Manila and Carmen,
you are the captains
for this team challenge.
Manila, you won the toss.
Who do you pick first?
- Raja.
Thank god I won the coin toss.
Gag.
I want Raja because Raja is
the only person I've seen here
that's actually done a sit-up.
- All right, Carmen,
who do you choose?
- Hmm, I want a big girl.
I want Delta.
- All right.
- My first pick is Delta
because I wanted to form
the prettiest group,
you know what I mean, so I
picked the prettiest big girl.
- Shangela.
- Mariah.
- Mimi.
- Ah!
- So I choose Yara.
- Alexis.
- Yes.
- I love Stacy,
but I already got my big girl.
So I 'm gonna choose India.
- I get Stacy.
- Yay.
- No shade, girl, no shade.
I've come to realize that if
this was gonna be
a workout challenge,
they were gonna leave
the big bitch behind, honey.
- Captain Manila...
Captain Carmen...
you're in charge of assigning
each queen an exercise
and creating a sporty team look.
Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best woman win.
All right.
- What's the--what's the name
of our video?
- It has to be hysterical.
- Transform yourself.
From flab to fierce.
- Mm.
- I have this idea.
What if I painted myself to look
like I was 85,000 years old,
and I was like, it's,
"Do you like my big ball?"
[giggles]
- What?
- Mimi gets that whole Miminess
of it all,
and it's driving me up the wall.
Shut up.
Shut the fuck up.
- I'm gonna do the stepper.
- You said you wanted something
with your boobs?
- The boob shaker thingy.
- So she has the shake weight.
- Titty shaker girl.
- Is that funny?
- No, you should just call it
the shake n' bake weight,
and you just shake and bake,
do it from this side.
- That's right, that's right.
- You can do it from this side.
- There's times when I feel like
I'm not heard,
because a lot of people
in this competition
like to talk over you.
- I can do the jump rope; what
can you do with jump roping?
- Chuck-a-rope.
- [giggles]
- What about chuck-a-rope?
- Okay, yep.
- Our challenge today is to
create a workout video in teams.
- I want us to look like,
kinda like a rainbow.
Like Skittles.
You do blue, and you do green.
Do red. Do red.
I think I'm a good leader.
I think I'm a great leader.
I'm really good
at judging things.
- Something tastic,
since it's elastic.
- No.
- I listen to people.
- You can put one in here.
- No.
- Like, I could--I could this
one, like...
- No.
- Carmen is so bossy.
- Okay.
But what is that gonna be for?
I don't know if Delta's gonna be
able to do that.
- This is gonna be about
physical fitness,
and I'm completely terrified.
The fact is,
I sit before you 350 pounds.
And I would say not a week goes
by that I don't get a letter
from someone commenting on what
a pig I am, or how ugly I am.
Jesus Christ, I feel sick.
Thank you for picking me.
- Of course, you're my girl.
Delta really needs to work on
her self-confidence issues
because she's flawless.
I think she's sickening,
you know what I mean?
And...it's a shame.
- So we're doing busted, right?
- Don't look, like,
too crazy busted.
- And we're doing garage doors?
- Garage doors, girl.
One color on your eye.
- Where'd you hear garage doors?
- One of my friends from Texas
was, like,
making fun of some queens.
She was like, "that bitch came
out with blue garage doors
on her eyes."
- [chuckles]
I'm sitting here thinking
it's an industry term.
I was like, mm-hmm, yeah,
garage doors, girl.
- Hello, hello, hello!
all: Hi.
- How are my little endorphin
junkies doing?
Team Carmen, right?
all: Yes.
- Now I wanna hear all about
your workout video.
Now India, did you choose
your expertise?
- I was assigned.
I got the rubber tug.
- Oh, have you ever used one
before?
- No. I don't know nothing
about exercising.
I don't work out, I don't have a
gym membership.
And I 'm like, "oh, god,
this could be good or bad."
- What about you, Yara?
- It's called<i> echar pa'lante.</i>
- Oh, help me with that.
- It means move forward.
You wanna look like this, you
gotta work it out, darlin'.
So<i> echar pa'lante.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
- Work it out.
- [giggles]
All right, Delta?
- So I'm going
to shake and bake.
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah.
- Delta, can you come over and
show me what you've done there?
I'm already inspired.
- Well, we're gonna start with
the weight here.
- Yeah.
- So it's gonna go up and down.
- Ooh, ooh.
- And then you're gonna go...
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
- Do you feel it?
- Shake it, don't break it.
Oh, yeah.
I think I just lost five pounds!
- Feel it.
Ha, ha!
- Stacy, you better come up with
something quick.
- Okay, we need to come up with
something else
because I just heard "shake
and bake" over there.
- Well, we'll just change
the name of it.
- What are you thinking, Stacy?
- Spritz stick.
- What?
- A spritz stick.
- What the hell's
a spritz stick?
- I do think that Stacy's
a lovely person.
And you know, we'd probably have
a really fantastic time
listening to bullfrogs and
drinking sweet tea in the
backwoods that she lives in.
But I would lose my mind if we
had to be on the bottom
because of her.
- Well, hello, ladies.
all: Hello.
- Manila,
you're the team captain.
- Yes.
- What is your area of expertise
in this workout video?
- The step and strap.
Works your core muscles.
You bend down and strap your
heels together.
- Have you done it yourself?
Have you tried it yet?
- Girl, no.
- No.
Great, just let the camera roll,
and step and strap.
- Yeah.
- Manila was just clueless.
You have to be prepared
in front of Ru.
- Stacy, do you have
an area of expertise
that you're doing in the video?
- My name's actually
the sit and shake.
- The sit and shake?
- Lets you eat your chips.
And while you're doing that,
feeding your face,
you can just shake it off,
like, you know?
- I like it.
Yeah, but what if you don't have
one of these things here?
- A can of soup will be just
fine.
- Okay, I love it.
What about you, Mimi?
What are you doing?
- You gotta love me jump rope.
And it's when you got that man
that you don't wanna lose...
- Yes.
- You can jump rope, grab him,
tie him up, and don't ever
let him leave.
- Now just be careful jumping
rope with heels--safety first.
- Of course.
- Now...
Shangela, what
is your expertise?
- This is the hallelula hoop.
Kate Gosselin, she learned this,
and then she loaned me
this hair.
- Oh. Oh, okay.
- You get your hallelula hoop,
and then you say...
and that'll keep your hip.
And the hula hoop hits
the ground.
Ru is probably thinking,
"This ho don't even know
how to hula hoop."
Now listen...
- Okay.
- If it goes down--you see,
I'm single.
- [giggles]
- But if it goes down, you talk
dirty to it
and it'll rise back up.
- Oh, I see.
- Cardinal rule.
- Everybody is very funny on my
team.
I'm very concerned about that,
'cause I don't--
I actually don't
do comedy at all.
- All right, Alexis.
- I'm going to be working out
my upper body,
using the stretch
your upper body.
- Oh, I see.
- And I'm using, of course...
lip gloss.
The "lapilaviar" stretch.
- So it's like a cross-training
thing?
- Yes.
- Your lips don't lie.
- Okay.
- Okay.
All right, ladies, now remember,
your workout videos need to be
truly inspirational.
So I'm bringing in someone
to help you...
Stop the insanity!
Fitness guru and motivational
speaker Susan Powter
will be here.
- Whoo!
- To help you make this workout
video truly inspirational.
- Susan Powter?
I mean, she's legendary.
When I was growing up, I even
wanted to bleach my hair
as white as hers.
That was, like, my reference
when I went to the hair stylist.
- I've got a few words of
inspiration for you myself.
Don't fuck it up.
- [giggles]
- Bye.
all: Bye, Ru.
- Okay.
- Good job, team.
- Well, well, well!
Hello, team Manila.
Meet Susan Powter.
all: Hi, Susan.
- Welcome to the fitness world,
ladies.
- Our first exercise is called
the step...and strap.
- Give me more over-the-top
drag queen sexy.
- Step and strap!
- What's your name, honey?
- I am Manila Luzon, and you've
just worked out
to the step and strap.
- And that's a cut.
- Hi, everybody, my name is
Alexis Mateo.
And right now, we gonna--just
gonna work out all
our upper muscles.
- I think that was super cute.
I think you should go
over-the-top.
- Hi, my name is Alexis Mateo
Rodriguez Rivera Ocherat--
<i>y todos los de mas.</i>
- [laughing]
- Here we go.
The stretchy thingy-majingy.
Open the lip gloss, and we gonna
pull...your lips.
- Give me a little more
attitude.
- Stretch and lips,
stretch and lips.
Are you guys at home getting it?
You need to breathe.
[panting]
My titties were sweating.
[panting]
Yes, you just gotta stretch
thingy-majingy lip gloss
with Alexis Mateo.
- Super cute.
Super cute.
- Tough act to follow.
- [deep voice] Well, hello,
ladies at home.
We're gonna increase some energy
and get rid of that unsightly
bulge in your pants, ladies.
Grab the ball and violently bang
your crotch for ten times.
Here we go!
all: Ah!
Two, three, four...
- Raja's character was just
totally crazy.
I just thought
it was really crude.
Not what you're gonna expect
from a drag queen to act like,
basically a dude.
- They call it, in the
infomercial industry,
that soft to camera moment.
- Mm.
- Where you do the "and you
can!"
And then you go,
"and you can also."
- Ah.
- It's that moment.
Give me a little swear
this is gonna work
for you moment, please.
- A lot of times, things don't
go the way that you plan them.
- Yes, yes.
- Okay, that happens for a lot
of us out there.
But let me tell you something.
You pick up the hallelula hoop,
and you put it back around
your waist.
And you work the hallelula hoop.
One, two, three, four,
I don't want that boy no more.
Five, six, seven, eight.
I am gonna find a date.
- From your hips to god's lips.
- Hallelu.
- Yes.
- Shangela was adorable.
Shangela is always adorable.
Like a little puppy or kitty
cat, they're always gonna be
cute, no matter...if they're
shitting on your carpet.
- Well, how you doin'?
My name is Stacy Layne Matthews.
Grab your plates, and we're
gonna take our sit and shake,
and we're gonna shake it.
Come on, girls.
- When you shake that, your
beautiful body shakes with it.
So if you're gonna be it, don't
just be it shoving shit in your
mouth.
Be it physically.
- Shake it!
Ooh, ugh.
- Excellent.
- Ooh, yes.
Shake it.
- Stacy Matthews surprised me.
I was so proud of her 'cause she
completely turned it.
And I say "get it, Stacy.
Eat that chicken, you bitch."
- Mm! Mm!
- Hello, everybody.
My name is Mimi Imfurst.
Take your jump rope...
chase after your man.
You're gonna grab him... oh!
Hold him up--
- Cut, cut, cut.
Just hold on a second.
Safety first, people.
We don't want anybody
to get hurt.
It's just feeling
a little disorganized.
Okay, everybody get up
and get untied.
- All right, here we go, jump.
Jump higher!
You gotta get higher, you gotta
find yourself.
I thought I did great.
I really wanted to create
a character
that really was memorable.
Quick, jump higher!
Faster, faster!
You wouldn't be able to forget
that voice.
'Cause perspiration is
inspiration.
- Team Carmen.
- Yes.
- Bitch, we ready to work it
out, and we're gonna pump it up.
Okay.
So...remember, catchphrase is
"work it out."
Work it out, work it out,
work it out.
Okay, so I just have a question.
Do I have to do it from here,
or can I walk in
and then start from here?
Or does it have to be very,
like, "welcome?"
- You can walk in.
- Do I get a little...?
Hello, everybody.
My name is Carmen Carrera.
And I would--am so excited to
welcome you to work it out.
All right, ladies, we're ready
to pop a squat.
You're gonna work everybody's
favorite asset.
So we're gonna go down... up and
around.
Down again.
And up the other way.
- Cut for a minute.
Now Carmen, we're asking you to
make a connection with the
camera, but we're actually
making a connection
with your ass.
- Well, yeah.
- Hello, ladies.
I'm here to show you one of my
favorite workouts.
It's called the rubber tug.
Gonna lower it down, ladies.
One, two, three, four.
- It was a little low energy.
- Give me more face.
- Yes.
- You've gotta--
give me more of that.
- Inspire us to get up off
the couch.
- Okay.
What we're gonna do is
we're gonna place it under our
toe, ladies.
Pull up...
- Oh!
- And down...
- Ah, it doesn't matter.
- [laughing]
- One, two, three, four.
- I was actually--it was
exciting watching the girls back
there, 'cause they were camping
it up a little bit.
- When you're making a video,
you have to express your
personality, and you have to
convince.
And I didn't get that from
India.
- Hi.<i> </i>
<i>Hola!</i><span style="bodyStyle"> [speaking Spanish]</i>
'Cause you like Latin guy...
[claps]
You have to work your body,
darling.
If you don't understand me,
don't worry--I will include
a translation
at the end of the video.
- [laughing]
- It's called<i> echar pa'lante.</i>
You gonna step on the step, and
you gonna cha, cha,
<i>echar pa'lante!</i>
Cha, cha,<i> echar pa'lante!</i>
- I feel like I am making a
workout video with Uber-Charo.
- Oop-a!
- And we are going to go ahead
and show you how to keep a tight
snatch to make sure that you
keep your man so he don't have
to come and bother me, okay?
- Get to what you're doing,
don't tell me what you're doing.
- All right, first you put your
ball...
in a nice, delicate position.
And stretch.
Ah, and bring it back.
And stretch.
Do y'all feel that?
Ah!
- I liked Mariah.
She did not bring it,
she did not have conviction.
You're sitting in front of
RuPaul and you're a drag queen,
you better pull it together.
- All right, I feel like my
snatch has been aired out.
- Hey, ladies, my name is Delta.
We're gonna start with one of my
favorite exercises,
the shake and bake.
We're gonna start with the small
weight.
Squeeze your boobs together,
that's always a good asset.
One, two, three.
Now if you're working out with a
partner, have them stand behind
you and reach around.
They can give you
a little bit too.
It's so fun to work out with
a partner.
- You should go over-the-top
with the shake.
Over-the-top! You like it?
Get vicious.
- One, two, three.
- Yes!
- Like that.
See how that feels?
Do it like that!
If you've got enough, you can
stick it right down inside there
and you can jump up and down.
This challenge started off to be
my worst nightmare.
But this challenge is gonna be
my strongest success.
- Nice job, team Carmen.
- Thank you.
- Now, ladies... tomorrow night
on the main stage,
come dressed in an outfit
that features
your favorite body part.
Because along with Susan Powter,
our extra special guest judge
will be la-luminous,
la-legendary...
Latoya Jackson.
- [gasps]
Oh, my god.
This is unbelievable.
I love Latoya.
I would jump up and get her.
- Go hit the showers!
- All right.
- Another day.
- Good morning.
- We're back in the workroom,
and today's runway challenge is
to pick something from your
closet that accentuates your
favorite or your best body part.
- I am wearing a dress that's
just low-cut, because I'm gonna
show off my boobs.
- I'm doing titties too, girl.
- Okay, there we go.
- I think I've showed it
already, so I 'm just gonna wear
something complimentary.
- Chaps.
You have a pair of chaps over
there you
about to put on, Carmen?
- I don't wanna be known as the
naked one.
That's not really what I wanna
go for.
And it just keeps coming up.
So I'm gonna do something that
Carmen would do, but just
a different kind of Carmen.
- Should I start out with a
ruffle cone?
- Yeah.
And then take it off?
Girl, I'm not, like, a skinny
twig.
You know, like, I look like a
football player out of drag.
And I will never look
like a woman.
My drag, it's more clown
than anything.
Did you always go by India?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
- My brother's ex-boyfriend at
the time was my drag mother.
He got me started and he gave me
the name India Ferrah.
- Oh, so your brother's gay?
- Yeah.
- That's great.
That's really good.
- My family's really supportive,
so.
- That's so great.
My biological family, they threw
me out of the house.
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.
Through all this--this awful
things that have happened to me
in my life, laughter is a way--
it's a coping mechanism.
Because if you can laugh at it,
you can deal with it.
- I think I worry too much what
people think,
and I've gotta get over that.
I was a little nervous 'cause,
you know, I got picked last.
Back at home, I'm a whole lot
more out,
and open, and humorous.
I mean, I feel like I'm not
myself here.
I'm not used to such big
personalities.
- Just be strong.
I've been on your team twice
now.
I've never been disappointed.
- Thank you, girl.
Well, you work it out just as
much, honey.
- Oh, that's 'cause I work in
the spirit of hallelu.
[laughter]
- When I frst came out,
I was like, well, I guess
this is perfect timing
for me to become a drag queen.
If I'm gonna be a queer, I might
as well be, like, the queeriest.
- The queeriest, yeah.
My interest in drag was just
because I loved clothes
and fashion.
- How was high school for you?
- I was picked on,
I was really awkward, I was
a little on the heavy side.
In my generation of growing up,
gay was just kind of disgusting
and kind of a subculture,
and drag kind of came
and saved me.
But it was hard.
I grew up in a very, like, Latin
neighborhood.
- You're in California?
- Mmm-hmm.
- So where'd you grow up?
- Gainesville, Georgia.
It's not a progressive city as
far as the thought process.
I didn't feel like there was
something wrong with me;
I just knew that people were
picking on me.
Kids don't understand that being
different
ultimately means you're gonna
become something special.
Even if you don't have, like, a
strong support system at home,
you have to get that
from within.
<i>[laughter]</i>
<i>- And what?</i>
Hey, guys.
Welcome to the main stage of
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
Michelle Visage, hello, my dear.
- Hi, gorgeous.
- And I wanna welcome to the
<i>Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> family my good pal</i>
and makeup superstar, Billy B.
Hi, honey.
- Hey.
- I'm so glad you could get away
from Gaga to be with us.
- Thank you.
- And Susan Powter.
- Hi, Ru.
- So happy you're here.
- Thank you.
- And the multi-faceted yet
complex talents of Miss Latoya
Jackson is in the house tonight!
- Hello, gorgeous!
How are you?
- I am so happy you're here.
Welcome to my home.
- Why, thank you.
- This week, we challenged our
queens to make totally leotarded
workout videos.
Tonight, they're dressed to show
it off
and ready to pump you up.
Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best woman win!
Raja!
- Not a stitch of makeup on.
- None.
<i>- I've chosen my legs.</i>
<i>My inspiration for my outfit</i>
<i>was a milf/cougar who is sort</i>
<i>of waiting poolside for the</i>
<i>pool boy to come clean it up.</i>
- Nothing tastes as good as
skinny feels.
Manila.
It's very Manila Deville.
<i>- I wanna show off my face, so</i>
<i>I'm wearing a strapless dress,</i>
<i>pulling my hair up, so it's</i>
<i>very, like, "look at me."</i>
- She looks like Erte a bit too.
- Yes, it's very Erte.
- It's got bride of Frankenstein
in there too.
- Yes, his second wife.
Next up, Stacy Layne Matthews,
from back swamp to the main
stage.
<i>- My fat ass,</i>
<i>I'm gonna pull out</i>
<i>the skimpiest top that shows</i>
<i>off the biggest part of my</i>
<i>body, which is my tits.</i>
- Add a little R&amp;B in there.
- Rear and boobs. R&amp;B.
This is India Ferrah.
- Ooh, Rapunzel.
- X marks the spot.
<i>- I honestly chose the</i>
<i>see-through catsuit because it</i>
<i>shows my whole body.</i>
<i>I don't think anyone will have</i>
<i>trouble seeing my titties.</i>
<i>I mean, that's my favorite</i>
<i>body part.</i>
- Not a shy girl.
- She is training the ponies at
the circus.
- I think it needs a whip
though, for real.
- Up next, Alexis Mateo.
- Oh, that's beautiful.
- Look at those hips!
<i>- My best feature is</i>
<i>everything.</i>
<i>I'm gonna serve you hair,</i>
<i>face, hips, everything.</i>
- I love the glitter.
The sparkle is great.
- I'm blinded by her beauty.
Up next, Mimi Imfurst.
- Mimi in the leopard!
Isn't it Bette Midler?
- It is Miss Kitty.
<i>- I love my dress.</i>
<i>It's high camp, it's glamour.</i>
<i>And I think it's something</i>
<i>the judges haven't seen before.</i>
- Wow.
- Very slimming,
the butt looks good.
- Meow, meow.
- Up next, Shangela Laquifa
Wadley.
- Pull up to the bumper.
- Oh! Oh! Yes!
<i>- I choose to highlight my</i>
<i>shoulders.</i>
<i>The outfit that I had that</i>
<i>showcases my shoulders is one</i>
<i>I've had a little bit up my</i>
<i>sleeve.</i>
- She's giving you a little
Kardashian.
- She's giving Kardashian.
- She's the forgotten
Kardashian.
- This is Kiki Kardashian.
They call this queen Mariah.
- Bring the drama, Mariah.
- The elegance of brown.
- I love the hair.
And all the colors are
coordinating, aren't they?
<i>- My outfit, it complimented my</i>
<i>mood so much.</i>
<i>It was flowy, airy, sexy.</i>
- Milk chocolate is what it is.
- Milk does a body good.
Up next, Delta Work.
- Work.
- Ooh!
- All right, Delta.
- She looks like Delta Burke,
doesn't she?
<i>- I am geared up</i>
<i>for the judges.</i>
<i>I am ready to show the twins.</i>
<i>And I know that they're gonna</i>
<i>fall in love with my look.</i>
- Priscilla Presley happening
in there.
- A southern girl.
- John Waters would love her.
- I love that hair.
- Mm-hmm.
- Yara Sofia.
- Her legs are gorgeous.
Look at that.
<i>- I chose a short dress.</i>
<i>It is simple, but I am showing</i>
<i>my legs.</i>
- Is she wearing stockings?
Those are her legs!
- Those are her eyes.
- She bought them.
- She has the receipt.
- Carmen Carrera.
Oh, she's all grown up.
- Seductress.
<i>- I wanna show the judges</i>
<i>that I am versatile.</i>
<i>This beautiful gown is gonna</i>
<i>show off my beautiful ass.</i>
- All about Jersey right now.
- She's Jersey-licious
right there.
- Yes, ma'am.
Welcome, dolls.
Earlier, the judges screened
your workout videos.
You competed as teams,
but tonight you'll be judged
as individuals.
Will the following queens
please step forward?
Stacy Layne Matthews,
Mimi Imfurst,
Yara Sofia, India Ferrah,
Alexis Mateo, Mariah.
Ladies...
you represent the best
and the worst of the week.
Raja, Manila,
Shangela, Carmen, Delta.
Good job this week, ladies.
You're all safe.
Leave the stage.
Now.
Ladies, it's time to face
the judges.
Let's start with Alexis Mateo.
Let's go to Miss Latoya Jackson.
- I love anything that sparkles,
of course.
And you are one sparkle.
It's just absolutely beautiful.
- Your look has, like, a moment
of retro Barbra Streisand
Hollywood glamour.
- As far as the video goes,
it was very Puerto Rican
Chrissy Snow.
- Yes! She was!
- From<i> Three's Company!</i>
- Yes!
- I thought that was
so different and clever
at the same time.
- Your one of the first
contestants
who brought real humor.
- Thank you, Alexis.
Next, Mimi Imfurst.
- Your video was much more
of a comedy skit.
<i>- Today we're gonna help you</i>
<i>find you.</i>
- You don't have to pull every
drag trick out of the hat
every single time.
- The video was a little bit
of a let-down.
It was like Divine meets
Sally Struthers.
- I really wanted to come in and
create a large character.
You know, I try to put the B
in subtle.
- It was hokey.
It was not good.
- I feel like you wasted
an opportunity.
Thank you, Mimi.
- Thank you.
- Stacy Layne Matthews.
I guess I don't have to ask you
what body part you're featuring
tonight.
- You look so much like my
relatives.
Is she related and I don't know
it?
- The back swamp Jacksons.
- [giggles]
- I have to say, having eaten
chicken in your workout segment,
you actually made us laugh
with you.
- And to incorporate that
into an exercise,
I think you did an excellent job
on what you had to do.
- Thank you.
- I liked it.
I like what she did.
- What I really loved was seeing
a personality.
We need more of you, Stacy.
- India Ferrah.
- It's the hat with the feather,
and the ponytail to
the floor, and the glitter lips.
Your boobs out with Xs and a
tarantula or something
on your vajayjay...
there is so much going on.
I think, "well, what is she
covering up?"
- Is every outfit gonna be the
bosoms featured?
Because that's what we've gotten
three weeks in a row.
- Okay.
- As far as your workout,
I wasn't inspired.
I didn't feel that connection.
- There was nothing. There
wasn't even a joke.
It was nervous.
- You could tell she was scared.
<i>- Looking at the video, what</i>
<i>would you have done</i>
<i>differently?</i>
- You know, more inspirational
words.
- It's not just the words.
Inspiration has to come from a
sincere place inside of you.
Thank you, India.
- Thank you.
- Yara Sofia.
You took a potential liability,
which is your accent, and you
made it work for you.
- That whole Latin thing and
that sexy swish,
you had everyone roaring.
-<i> Echar pa'lante!</i>
<i>If you want that guy, you have</i>
<i>to work it out, darling.</i>
- I think you are so hot.
I just have a problem,
outfit-wise.
- I can take it off if you want.
- [laughs]
Well, thank you very much,
darling.
Up next, Mariah.
What body part were you
featuring?
- My face.
- I love the fact that all the
different browns coordinate
with you quite well.
And they work.
- And then there's, like, this
Vegas makeup
that I think cheapens you,
and I think you're too pretty
for that.
- During the workout video,
I think your own sincerity
didn't shine through, and we the
audience didn't believe you.
- If you could think of your
personality
as your face, get that same
confidence,
it will take you to another
level, and that's the truth.
- Well, girls,
we have heard enough.
While you enjoy an Absolut
cocktail in the interior
illusions lounge, the judges
and I will deliberate.
You may leave the stage.
Okay, now just between us girls.
Let's start with Alexis Mateo.
- I think she nailed
the bloody workout.
- I thought she was
the funniest one.
- Yeah.
- I like the energy.
- You worked in a workout video.
- Yes, I did.
- Was it difficult for you?
- It was, because unlike Susan,
I had never worked out before.
And I still don't work out
this day.
So I think once you start-- my
sister, she has to do it all
the time because
that's what she does.
- Right.
Let's move on to Mimi Imfurst.
The workout she did,
it wasn't funny.
- It was stupid.
- [laughing]
- Seriously.
- Right, it'd be a different
story if her shtick had
inspired us or at least made us
laugh.
- That's what I'm saying.
- Thing is, Mimi's always been
teetering
throughout the competition.
And I think she may have gone to
the other side.
Stacy Layne Matthews.
During her workout routine,
something was coming out.
- I know!
- There was potential.
- I like the fact that she made
fun of herself.
However, I don't feel that she
has what it takes to be
the next drag queen.
I just don't think so.
- Will she be in the bottom two?
That's the question.
India Ferrah.
- I hated the way
that she looked.
- I liked her so much.
I liked her.
- She's got a good energy.
She tried to do the double
entendre
with the rubber and the double X
magnum thing.
It just came off dirty
and not clever.
- Bottom line is,
her workout was boring.
- Yara.
Now what she did in that workout
was hilarious.
Who knew that she would do that?
- She's very sexy.
- Yes.
- Extremely sexy.
- She needs to burn
that dress though.
- You have it out for her
and that dress.
- I hated the dress too.
- Mariah.
I wasn't crazy about the snatch
tightening thing.
- It was like, eh.
- It was gay cruise humor.
- And the delivery wasn't good.
- Not at all.
- She has a beautiful face.
- For this title,
pretty isn't enough.
- All right...
[claps]
Silence!
Bring back my girls.
Welcome back, ladies.
Based on your totally leotarded
workout videos
and your performance
on the main stage,
I've made some decisions.
Yara Sofia, your joy and
enthusiasm need no translation.
Condragulations, you're safe
from elimination.
Alexis Mateo...
combining lip gloss with your
thingy-majingy, you've created
a new workout craze.
You are the winner of this
week's challenge.
You will receive a $2,500 gift
certificate to gilt.com.
Yes, that's gilt.com.
Plus immunity from elimination
next week.
Thank you, Alexis.
- Thank you guys so much.
- India Ferrah...
On the runway, your look
was too much.
In the challenge,
you gave too little.
I'm sorry, my dear, but you are
up for elimination.
<i>- My knees start shaking, and</i>
<i>I'm just standing there like,</i>
"oh, my god, what am I gonna
do?"
- Stacy Layne Matthews.
In your challenge, you ate
the scenery...literally.
And you made us laugh with you.
But still, we feel you are
holding back.
Condragulations, you're safe...
for now.
- I'll bring it.
<i>I think RuPaul gave me</i>
<i>a second chance.</i>
And I just want to be more open
and be myself
so people can actually see who I
really am.
- Mariah...
you are a bronze beauty.
But your workout performance
was pale.
Mimi Imfurst...
you showed us your glamorous
side on the runway.
But in the challenge, your
slapstick got sloppy.
Mariah, condragulations,
you're safe.
- Thank you so much.
- Mimi Imfurst...
I'm sorry, my dear, but that
means you are up for
elimination.
<i>- When Ru says that I'm in the</i>
<i>bottom two,</i>
I'm totally surprised.
I think that now anything goes.
- Two queens stand before me.
Ladies, this is your
last chance to impress me
and save yourself
from elimination.
The time has come for you
to lip-synch for your life!
Good luck.
And don't fuck it up.
<i>- I'm like, "well, bitch, step</i>
<i>it up."</i>
<i>You gotta make sure that you're</i>
<i>always the one that's in front.</i>
[low growling]
<i>- What the hell</i>
<i>is she thinking?</i>
You can't be lifting up
drag queens.
<i>- I was honestly scared.</i>
<i>And all I could do was scream.</i>
Get her off of me!
- [laughing]
- Whoo!
[applause]
- Ladies...
I have made my decision.
Mimi Imfurst...
Drag is not a contact sport.
India Ferrah...
Shante, you stay.
- Whoo!
- Mimi Imfurst...
you are, and will always be,
part of an elite group
of drag queens.
Remember that.
Now, sashay away.
- Thank you.
[sniffs, sighs]
<i>I don't agree with the judges.</i>
<i>I don't think I should've been</i>
<i>in the bottom two.</i>
I know what I do best, I do me.
And I'm just gonna keep
doing me.
I'm Mimi Imfurst.
Not Mimi, I'm like everyone
else.
- And to my girls...
condragulations.
And remember, if you can't love
yourself, how in the hell are
you gonna love somebody else?
Can I get an amen up in here?
all: Amen!
- All right, let the music play.

-<i> Previously on</i>
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race...</i>
There is no place like
the U.S. of A...
- No foam here.
100% American, made in the USA.
- Wah!
- Papi, I want you to come back
home, baby!
- Alexis Mateo,
you made us proud.
Condragulations.
You are the winner
of this challenge.
- I wanna say thank you to that
special person
that's shown me that I needed
to love myself first.
- Ladies...I have made
my decision.
<i>For the first time</i>
<i>in Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> history,</i>
no one is going home tonight.
- What?
- And tonight, Rupaulapalooza!
- Ooh!
-<i> The dolls hit a high note.</i>
-<i> But some fall flat.</i>
No.
-<i> And extra-special guest judges</i>
<i>Jody Watley and Carmen Electra.</i>
<i>The winner of</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
RuPaul's Drag Race
<i>will receive a lifetime supply</i>
<i>of Kryolan professional makeup,</i>
<i>headline Logo's</i><span style="bodyStyle"> Drag Race</i><i> tour,</i>
<i>featuring cocktails perfected</i>
<i>by Absolut,</i>
<i>and a cash prize of $75,000.</i>
And may the best woman win.
- Buon giorno, buon giorno.
- Back again, new day.
- We're all still here.
It's a new day, and there's
still six of us...
<i>because no one went home, so...</i>
<i>we'll see what's gonna happen.</i>
- Why do you think Ru gave us
another opportunity?
- Honestly, I think that Ru
feels like
she says--like we're both really
fierce queens.
Like if I was anyone else in
this competition,
I might feel a little bit like
oh, shit, like...
Ru feels like we're too good
to go.
I would be nervous.
- Can somebody just slap her
and wake her up?
- I wasn't expect to be in
the bottom two.
- You never expected--
- And, yes, I know--and I know.
I know, I know, but...I still
have something to learn.
I appreciate that RuPaul give me
another opportunity.
I cannot fuck it up.
[siren]
-<i> Ooh, girl, you got she mail!</i>
Hey, dragsters.
all: Hey!
- Listen up.
Can you hear that?
It's herstory calling.
<i>Learn to embrace the past.</i>
Make it your own...and you just
might be America's next
drag superstar.
Hello, hello, hello!
Hi...my gorgeous queens.
Now, to kick things off, we're
gonna play a little game
of Rusical chairs.
all: Oh!
-<i> It's a lot like</i>
<i>musical chairs.</i>
When the music stops,
who's ever left standing
has to finish the lyric.
If you get it right, you get
to give a queen the boot.
But if you're wrong, you're out.
Oh, and you have to play
the game wearing high heels.
- Oh, of course!
[laughter]
-<i> Are you ready?</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
- Yes!
- Let the music play.
[music stops]
- Oh!
- Ah ha!
- Carmen is left standing.
What lyric comes next?
- Um...
- Ding ding ding ding ding!
<i>You got it!</i>
- Mm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm!
- You get to give one
of the queens the boot.
- I choose...Shangela.
- I knew it was me.
- Bye!
- Let the music play!
[music stops]
- Ha ha ha ha!
- Carmen, dear, are you on
a five-second delay
or something?
What lyric comes next?
- I got to think about this one.
[laughter]
I'd rather something than try to
fit in.
Damn, these bitches got me.
- I'm sorry, Carmen,
but you are out.
You may join Shangela.
Let the music play.
[music stops]
- Oh!
- Ha ha!
- That is right.
Ha ha ha ha!
- Get out, girl!
all: Oh!
- There are two chairs left
and three queens.
[music stops]
- Ha ha ha ha!
All right, Yara.
- Can't wait to hear this.
I don't know!
- Time is up, Yara, I'm sorry.
But go ahead and join
the other girls.
Okay, we have two girls
and one chair.
Sounds like a video you can
watch online.
[laughter]
Okay. Let the music play.
[music stops]
both: Aah!
- Ah ha ha!
- All right, Raja.
Do you know the lyric?
- Mm...
-<i> We have a winner!</i>
- Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop!
Ow!
- Now, it is time to pump up
the volume.
<i>For this week's main challenge,</i>
you'll need to find inspiration
from the vast herstory of music
to perform in a ladyboy music
festival
we're calling...
Rupaulapalooza...
sponsored by Absolut vodka.
Please welcome Jeffrey Moran.
[applause]
all: Hi!
- Hi, guys.
There are a couple of things
I think you need to know as you
go through the competition.
You need to let your personality
show through.
We really wanna see that you
know who you are.
<i>Show us what it means to be</i>
part of this family and part
of Absolut.
- Now, ladies, this week
each of you will record
the brand-new RuPaul song
<i>Super Star.</i>
all: Ooh!
- But each of you will be
interpreting it in a totally
different
<i>and timeless musical style.</i>
<i>Your options are hip-hop...</i>
<i>country...</i>
<i>disco...</i>
<i>reggae...</i>
<i>punk, or pop.</i>
Now, Manila, since you won
the mini-challenge,
<i>you get to choose first.</i>
And then one at a time,
you decide who chooses next.
- I'm gonna go with...
bloo, bloo, bloo, bloo, bloo...
disco!
- Ooh-ah, ooh-ah, ooh-ah!
- Now, Manila, who gets
to choose next?
- We'll go with Raja.
- I want punk.
-<i> Who gets to go next?</i>
- Yara.
- Yara gets to go next.
<i>Come on over, Yara.</i>
-<i> Manila picks Yara, not Carmen.</i>
What happened to Team Heather?
- I'm gonna take pop.
- All right, Manila,
who goes next?
- Alexis.
- Alexis.
- Thank you, Manila.
- I get what you're trying to
do, Manila,
but girl, just pick
the Heathers.
Who cares about those boogers?
Girl, stop being fair.
- I'm gonna take the hip-hop.
- All right, mami.
- Next is Carmen.
- Next is Carmen.
- Finally.
- Carmen, are you feeling
coun-try?
Or are you feeling reg...gae?
- I really like reggae.
So I'm gonna go with reggae.
- Okay!
And of course, that means,
Shangela, you are our
country queen.
- I'm straight out
of Paris, Texas,
and I'm going to hold onto
the country.
- All right, ladies, before
your recording session,
<i>you'll have time to rehearse</i>
<i>and put together</i>
an appropriate performance
outfit.
<i>Until then, gentlemen...</i>
start your engines...
and may the best woman win!
- Carmen Carrera.
Join us here on
<i>Alexis Mateo Show.</i>
<i>You have any questions</i>
<i>for our comedy queen?</i>
- No, I thought you--I thought
you was gonna ask--
I thought this was your show.
- I'm giving you the free option
to say something to her before
we continue
just criticizing you.
[laughter]
Manila just took me by surprise.
- I wasn't expecting her
to pick me first.
I know her.
She would have said okay.
<i>Now, who do I think's gonna try</i>
<i>to turn this competition?</i>
I don't want them to have
the music they want.
- I don't really read into
those things.
I think that some people might
want to, you know, stir up
some drama because of that, but
I think that's why she did it.
- Oh, I don't think nobody's
trying to stir up drama.
<i>But you can be stupid all day</i>
<i>long,</i>
pretend to be aloof,
but I know better, honey.
You go play that one with
somebody else.
- I think Alexis and Shangela
wanna start drama.
Fuck those hos.
Who cares?
Maybe she did and maybe
she didn't.
I don't know.
I'm gonna ask that bitch.
Gonna ask her now.
<i>They're trying to say that</i>
<i>you're trying to sabotage me</i>
because I only had two options
instead of four,
and I should have been called up
there after this bitch.
- You know what, honey,
it's not shade.
I'm not strategizing
besides myself.
- Oh, so you're being selfish.
- Going down the line was like
the easiest and fairest
way to do it, 'cause I don't
wanna start drama
being like picking you guys
first and then having
all the other girls being like,
"Oh, Manila's just picking
the Heathers."
- I actually wanted the reggae
one, actually, so...
- Well, then it worked out,
so what are you fucking
complaining about, bitch?
- I'm not complaining about
anything.
<i>Don't get me twisted, honey.</i>
- You know what? No.
<i>Carmen's trying to start up</i>
<i>some motherfucking drama!</i>
She's turning into Shangela.
<i>The main challenge this week</i>
<i>is we have to record</i>
<i>our own version</i>
of RuPaul's new single
<i>Super Star,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
and we have to perform it in
front of a live audience.
- [laughing]
- It is battle of the vocals
right now.
<i>Everyone is doing their song.</i>
- Girl, I thought I was at
the audition for<i> Glee.</i>
- [off-key]
- Yara sounds horrible.
- Maybe tone is lost in
translation.
- She don't sing it in Spanish.
She doesn't sing in English.
[laughing] She doesn't sing in
any language.
- Bah!
- Hello, hello, hello,
my superstars.
all: Hello.
- Hey, Carmen.
- Hey, hey.
- Lady reggae.
- Yes.
- Does this challenge
frighten you at all?
- No, this excites me.
- Because you were
in the bottom two...
- Maybe I might have a little
bit more to prove,
but I like a challenge.
I'm not gonna try to fake it,
you know?
I'm just gonna sing like I do
and gonna go with something that
I can pull off.
- Irie, man.
One love.
- Okay.
- Well, hello, Raja.
- Hi, gorgeous lady
of wrestling.
- [laughs] Yes!
So why'd you choose punk?
- As much as I wanted to be a
punk rocker as a teenager,
I was way too glamorous up here.
- Ha ha ha ha!
- Like I could not stick
a safety pin in my nose.
I might bleed, it might hurt.
- You've been criticized for
over-thinking your challenges.
You're very cerebral.
What is your strategy to sort of
break out of that?
- Well, you know, this is
a perfect one for me
because I can finally go balls
to the wall.
- Something that's always worked
for me is to remember
that what other people think
of you...
- Right.
- Is none of your business.
- Yeah.
- That--that's their--
that's them.
All right, Raja.
- Thanks, Ru.
- Get back to work.
- Right. See ya later!
- Hey, Manila.
- Hi.
- Do you have your disco moves
together?
Can you do the bump?
- Yes.
- Can you do the double bump?
Uh-uh.
You got it, kiddo.
- Yara Sofia!
The new princess of pop.
- Yes.
- Do you know how to sing
at all?
- Um...yes.
- You do? [laughs]
There was a little hesitation
there.
- Yes.
<i>I'm not the best singer.</i>
I'm an actress.
You have to believe it.
And in front of the mirror,
I'm gonna practice--
<i>"I'm a singer, I'm a singer,</i>
<i>I'm a singer,"</i>
and I'm gonna sell it.
- I'm very glad I kept you
around,
because I'm very excited to see
your pop princess.
- You're gonna love it, darling.
- Hey, Shangela.
- Hi, Ru.
- Now, you got stuck with
country.
Would you have chosen it?
- It's not about the song.
- Yeah.
- It's the look.
There's the traditional,
you know,
Jessica Simpson, these boots are
made for walkin' kinda look.
- Yeah.
- And then there's
Carrie Underwood concert.
- That is quite a conundrum
because a lot of people are
gonna expect...
- Jean skirts and plaid tops.
- You're just gonna have to
follow your heart on this.
Yo, yo, yo, yo!
- [laughing] Hey, Ru.
- Whassup?
- I got the hip-hop.
- And you chose this.
- Yes.
I'm modeling myself after
Lil' Kim.
- Uh-oh!
- [laughing] Yes!
- Uh-oh, the queen bee?
- I love Lil' Kim.
Ru knows I am hip-hop.
[pops tongue]
- Keep it hood and, um...
- Peace.
- Peace.
Bam!
- Bam!
[pop]
- All right, ladies,
in a few moments,
you'll be headed to
a professional recording studio.
- [whooping]
- Now, tomorrow on the main
stage,
you'll be debuting your version
of<i> super star</i><span style="bodyStyle"> in front</i>
of a live audience.
<i>We'll be joined by our</i>
<i>extra-special guest judges,</i>
<i>Grammy-award winning artist</i>
<i>Jody Watley...</i>
- Ooh!
- Hey!
- Jody Watley is an amazing
performer.
So I'm excited that someone on
that judge's panel
is gonna finally be looking at
performance over look.
-<i> And the sizzling hot</i>
<i>Carmen Electra.</i>
- Wow!
- Whoo!
- So whatever you do...
don't fuck it up.
- [snickers] Shangela.
She looks like Mystique's
country realness.
- Poor Shangela.
I mean, she's got country and...
ugh!
It's tragic.
How's Shangela gonna do
in country?
- I think she's gonna rely what
she's been relying on this
whole time--
being a loud mess.
<i>I don't know what the hell</i>
<i>Shangela's wearing right now.</i>
<i>Like she just cut a piece</i>
<i>of fabric,</i>
<i>and it's all uneven</i>
<i>and it just--</i>
it's not making any sense to me.
- I hope that I don't get ragged
for not coming out there
in a cowboy hat, you know,
in a denim skirt, but...
it's not that.
<i>It's more this.</i>
This is Carrie Underwood
concert.
You know what--you know what
I mean?
- She's somehow got her way
through
with fucked-up outfits before,
so, you know, we'll see
what happens with her.
Bless her little heart.
- Hey.
- Hi. I'm Shangela.
- I'm Lucian.
- Today our main challenge is
to record RuPaul's song
<i>super star</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
in a specific musical genre.
- Have you been in the studio
before?
- No. I have not.
- This is your microphone.
Steve is in the booth.
He's gonna help us out.
- Lucian produced RuPaul's CD
<i>Champion.</i>
<i>This is real!</i>
<i>It makes me feel like</i>
<i>I'm already</i>
a musical recording artist.
-<i> The melody that you're singing</i>
there seems a little different.
- Okay.
- Are you changing it on
purpose?
-<i> I may have taken it too high</i>
<i>with the "oh."</i>
- What I would say is that--
- But I'll do it...
and then I'll take your feedback
on it.
I'd love to record one more
time,
and then that way I can get
the timing down for the intro,
so you guys may not have to do
any editing,
which would be nice.
<i>Okay. Thank you.</i>
- It seems like Shangela might
benefit
from being less confident.
[laughs]
- Anything else that I can do to
make it better?
No is okay too.
<i>[laughing]</i>
- It's gonna be my first
experience as a singer okay?
So...easy on me.
-<i> Oh, okay. All right.</i>
It's really scary, though.
- It is?
It's been a while since we have
seen a hot, gorgeous guy.
Bam!
I cannot concentrate.
- Okay...
There's a lot to go over here.
- What you didn't like?
- You sound terrified.
- I am terrified.
- Your vocals are like...
oh...oh...
- Shaking?
I know! I'm nervous.
-<i> I know.</i>
What would make you not nervous?
- We cannot say that on TV.
[pop]
[music ends]
- Yeah, it's those upper notes
that are a little like...
- So I'll just like push harder.
- Well, don't think push.
Just think power.
- Okay.
- Here we go.
[stronger]
[music ends]
Okay, if you can run some
auto-tune on that,
that'd be great.
[laughter]
- Just enunciate the words
a little bit more and make it
a little more prettier
in that girl punk way.
<i>[laughs]</i>
What does that mean?
- Sounds like you have a deeper
voice
than the key of this song.
- I'm kind of a more edgy gal.
<i>I don't wanna compromise</i>
<i>my voice</i>
and fuck it up by doing
something
that's out of my range.
- We gotta figure out how to
make you sound less
"I can't find the right..."
- The right tune.
Right.
<i>I can't wait to perform in</i>
<i>front of a live audience,</i>
and I just hope that
the recording...
the look, all of it goes well
so that the audience
can love it.
Yeah, there is definitely
pressure.
- Maybe we should play it back
so you can hear...
and then maybe we can figure out
a game plan.
- I'm doing reggae.
- Okay.
- But I don't wanna be like...
old-school,
like with the accent...
- You don't wanna play up any
comedy here or anything.
- Yeah, I think that's--that's
not really my thing.
- Well, this is the microphone.
- Okay.
This is to catch my spit,
I guess?
- It's actually to block
the air from...
- Oh!
[off-key]
[laughing]
I'm sorry.
Hearing my voice
is freaking me out.
- Do you think that you're
performing right now?
- Well, I don't sing,
so it's like is there a way that
you can throw in
some extra things in the beat?
The beat is so like...
da da da.
- Reggae is laid-back.
You have to perform it.
If you were in a club
and you were singing this
and there was a crowd of people
around you,
<i>what would you do?</i>
- I would sound like a mess.
But let's go, let's do it.
[music starts]
No.
- It's just not interesting
at all.
It's just like...just so flat.
If you don't give me something
more entertaining,
it's gonna be like...
[snaps]<i> Just do it.</i>
- I'm a little frustrated.
<i>Lucian just wants me to keep</i>
<i>going, give more.</i>
But this is not my thing.
- I think we're done.
- Oh! That was crazy.
Ah! Fuck.
I'm sorry.
Fuck.
- Okay, here we go.
From the beginning.
Fuck.
Sounds bad, right?
- It's still not great, no.
- Okay, uh, let's try--
keep trying, 'cause...
- Okay. Here we go.
- I'm sorry.
Is bad too?
- We should figure out the
best way
to make you...sound good.
- I'm doing my best.
I don't have the best...voice.
<i>But after being in the bottom</i>
<i>two last week,</i>
I'm gonna be a professional and
I'm gonna be more serious.
- You know, I have to give you
props, because you're workin'.
[laughs]
- Thank you, Lucian.
<i>Appreciate it.</i>
- I felt like Yara was always
trying hard, even,
<i>to make something happen.</i>
But I don't know that anything
ever really did.
[music ends]
[hip-hop]
- Recording artist Manila Luzon
is in the house!
- Whoo-hoo!
- Yaaah!
- Oh, are those our music?
We walk into the workroom,
and and there are mp3 players
just waiting there
with our songs on them.
<i>Today we have to lip sync the</i>
<i>song we had just recorded...</i>
<i>super star!</i>
- Oh!
I gotta be alone.
<i>Hearing my voice</i>
<i>with the track and the lyrics,</i>
I mean, it was a full-on song,
and it was me singing it.
And I had never heard that
in my life.
I love it!
I love it, I love it!
I wanna do more.
It's good to have that feeling,
<i>'cause I'm an old jaded queen,</i>
and I just--I was, like, beside
myself.
- Whoo-hoo! I love it!
I'm so excited to hear my song!
I cannot believe it!
I can understand me!
- Wow, Yara!
- What?
- I love it--I can actually
understand you.
- Oh, shit!
I sound sickening!
I sound ten times better
than what I was expecting to
sound like.
- It's awesome!
- It sounds great!
Bam!
-<i> So I got my track.</i>
<i>I'm listening to it.</i>
But I'm like, oh...my...God.
I don't like the way it sounds
right now.
- I wanna hear yours.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I need to learn mine.
I don't like the song
personally,
so I'm not gonna go around
and like spreading my bad song
to everyone.
I wanna keep it to myself and be
like, all right,
let me think of a plan in order
to make this work.
- So, Heather, what did you
think of your recording session?
How'd it go yesterday?
- It went well.
I like it.
- Now that we have our music,
I was like, "Oh, dang,
I don't know about this."
<i>It's kind of weird to hear</i>
<i>my own voice.</i>
<i>Trust me; it sounds a lot</i>
<i>better in my head,</i>
but there was really nothing
left to do
except to perform
the hell out of it.
This is gonna be interesting.
- Oh...making a cowboy hat?
- Mm-hmm.
- Did you rhinestone the trim?
- Uh-huh.
- That's cute.
Do you need more rhinestones?
I have some more.
- Mm-mm. I have some more.
Oh, you sure you don't wanna put
some more rhinestones on that?
<i>That was not her trying to help</i>
<i>me.</i>
<i>That was her trying to get into</i>
<i>my head.</i>
- Well, these are pretty
rhinestones, gir.
- Thank you.
[dramatic music]
[RuPaul laughing]
[music plays]
<i>Well, hello there!</i>
Welcome to the main stage
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
Michelle Visage, a name
that's music to my ears.
- Aw, go on.
- Jeffrey Moran...
<i>Absolut brand czar.</i>
Baby, we gotta stop meetin'
like this.
- Yes, honey, but in that dress,
we're gonna meet a lot more
often.
- [laughs]
Jody Watley.
Not only are you one of my
favorite singers,
you're my favorite<i> Soul Train</i>
dancer.
- Thank you!
- Carmen Electra, welcome!
I feel so Paisley Park tonight.
- Yes, very!
- This week, each of our queens
was challenged to record my song
<i>Super Star</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
<i>in a different style.</i>
Now they're here to perform in
front of a live audience
at Rupaulapalooza,
sponsored by Absolut.
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.
[music plays, applause]
[whooping]
<i>I just unfold my wings.</i>
<i>I'm giving you</i><span style="bodyStyle"> Soul Train</i>
<i>realness, honey.</i>
<i>I know I look good.</i>
<i>I'm feelin' fabulous.</i>
Whoo-whoo!
Alexis is serving hip-hop.
- [whooping]
- Bam!
- Can I get a hallelu?
<i>Everyone looks wired.</i>
They might as well be in
a country hoe-down,
<i>and I love that.</i>
<i>So I just start boot-scootin'</i>
<i>my way</i>
<i>right on across that stage.</i>
<i>I'm a little worried</i>
<i>about the audience...</i>
how they are gonna take this
ballad.
But at the end...people like
receiving me with open arms.
<i>I love it.</i>
[singing in native language]
<i>It's hard to get into character</i>
<i>and be, you know,</i>
<i>the sexy person</i>
performing to, like, the cats
in the alley.
<i>So I'm just trying to like do</i>
<i>something that's gonna</i>
<i>compensate</i>
for the horrible vocal.
[punk rock music begins]
- [whooping]
<i>I go out there, and I'm really</i>
<i>feeling my look.</i>
I want it to embody punk as a
philosophy and as a movement,
<i>and I just wanted to have</i>
<i>a great time out there.</i>
- [whooping]
- Ladies...
<i>it's time for the judges'</i>
<i>critique.</i>
Let's start with Manila.
- Ooh!
- [laughing]
- I thought the lip sync
could've
been a little more on point.
I wanted to feel like you were
singing it a little bit more.
- I was surprised that you went
directly to the audience,
as soon as you came onto
the stage.
I felt you grabbing
at the audience too early.
- Okay.
- Your moves were great.
You had really super moves,
and I pray to god there's a
bottle of Absolut
hidden in that fro somewhere.
- There's actually a whole case.
- The song was totally late '70s
<i>After School Special</i>
starring Scott Baio theme song,
which I love.
And you look gorgeous.
- Thank you.
- Next up, Alexis Mateo.
<i>Now, tell us about your outfit.</i>
- My outfit was inspired
by Lil' Kim.
- Uh! Bam!
Girl, I think you got Missy
Elliott stuffed up in there!
- Yes. Big ol' titties
and lotsa ass.
- Alexis sold it.
I could tell that you were
enjoying it.
<i>The lip sync was great.</i>
<i>Loved the rap.</i>
<i>- I'm a hip-hop girl,</i>
and this is like Hannah Montana
does hip-hop.
-<i> Hannah Montana?</i>
- All right, up next,
our country queen Shangela.
- Hey, y'all.
- You chose to do today's
country look
<i>like Carrie Underwood</i>
<i>and Taylor Swift.</i>
-<i> To me it was a little more pop</i>
<i>than country.</i>
I would have liked to have seen
something
just a little bit more
unexpected.
- You definitely came out
with the energy.
There's no question.
<i>But I think I almost saw that</i>
<i>energy getting the best of you.</i>
It got a little sloppy
sometimes.
- Your energy is always great.
<i>But I would have liked to have</i>
<i>seen</i>
a little more country stuff
in there.
- But I just--you know, I feel
that it's important that we just
are open-minded with regard
to country.
I know you guys are definitely
open-minded to that,
and so I appreciate all
your comments back.
- When we're sitting here,
we hear that song,
that's what dictated it.
It's not our preconceived notion
of country.
It's that [imitating banjo]
You know?
That's what you heard.
- All right, next up, our
pop princess Yara Sofia.
I love the fact that you put
some Spanish in there.
- Yes.
-<i> That was fantastic.</i>
- Thank you.
- I don't know if I would have
picked that outfit
for that version of the song,
<i>but you do look spectacular.</i>
- I appreciate that sex sells.
<i>I might have maybe covered up</i>
<i>a little skin.</i>
- Had you stood at the back
of the stage back there
for a little longer with
the mic stand,
you could have sold the ballad
a little bit more.
- Yes, you could have worked
the mic stand more,
but you connected
with the audience.
I love the glitter.
<i>It's very Britney MTV</i>
<i>Video Music Awards,</i>
<i>I'm a Slave.</i>
Britney wants her old body back
too, by the way.
- I bet she does.
[laughter]
Up next, our punk queen Raja.
We've been asking you here for
you to tap into that power
that you have when you walk
the runway,
and it looked to me like
you did it.
- I loved it.
<i>I loved the performance;</i>
<i>the lip sync was great.</i>
- You really owned the stage on
this one.
<i>I mean, I was there.</i>
<i>I felt like I could have gotten</i>
<i>in the mosh pit.</i>
- When I was 14, I had the same
hairdo, but it was blue.
<i>Everything was on tonight,</i>
<i>Raja.</i>
Your performance, your look,
your attitude, the emo...
Like, way on.
- Thank you so much.
<i>- Up next...</i>
lady reggae, Carmen Carrera.
Tell me about your outfit.
- Well, my outfit is kind of
like if Bob Marley
had a lovechild
with a Puerto Rican girl
and she grew up in jersey.
-<i> I love the outfit.</i>
There was some problems
in the lip sync.
It was a little off.
- So, now Jeffrey, she pulled
the guy up onstage,
but she left him there.
- Frankly, he diverted
my attention
a little too much from you.
This is about you.
You're going to be
the super star.
It made me feel like quality
impression...
and a little low on the
delivery.
- I sound horrible,
but that's okay--I'm a man.
- You didn't sound horrible.
You didn't--you just--it felt
that you weren't committed
to the vocal.
Ladies, $75,000 is at stake.
<i>And the decisions get harder</i>
<i>and harder to make.</i>
And I need your help.
Who should go home tonight
and why?
Raja.
- Oh, man.
I fucking hate this question.
You know what, I--
oh, God.
I would Shangela,
only because, you know what,
clearly you could go down
the line,
you can tell which genre
of music every one,
for the most part,
and then, you know, it just kind
of gets lost
as far as her look.
- Carmen, same question.
- I have to agree with Raja
because I feel that there's
always a look issue.
You need to look the part
if you're going to be
a drag super star.
- Where look is definitely
important,
you have to be able to perform,
and you need to be able
to connect,
and obviously she didn't do that
tonight,
and she has continuously not
done that
throughout this competition,
and that's truly why I feel
Carmen Carrera
should be the one who goes home
tonight.
- Alexis Mateo.
- I'm going to pick Carmen
Carrera as well,
and I think she's resting
and pretty.
- All right, girls,
I think we've heard enough.
Now while you enjoy an Absolut
cocktail
in the Interior Illusions
lounge,
the judges and I will
deliberate.
You may leave the stage.
All right, just between us
girls...
<i>We'll start with Manila.</i>
Now, I have never enjoyed
a performer
to come out and immediately
attack the audience.
- I loved the fro,
and I love what she delivered,
but I think I'm with you.
I don't want her attacking
that audience.
- I think she looked good;
her costume and the whole
package.
And I love that she attacked
the audience.
Good for her.
-<i> Alexis Mateo.</i>
- The good was she really did
own her performance.
- It's hip-hop.
We don't know you as that kind
of an artist,
and then you come out here.
You got a hip-hop hat on,
you got a girl hip-hop jacket
on,
and then the rest is stripper.
That's not hip-hop.
- I mean, what was she supposed
to wear,
some--she's supposed to sport
a sag and a wife beater?
- If I pick her up, we're going
to an interview
and I see those--you
gotta cover those up!
- Well, a big trend
in queens these days
are those latex boobs.
- Oh! I don't like the way
they look.
Those aren't breasts.
These are breasts!
- Oh! Girl!
- These are breasts!
- You don't have to tell me
twice.
Shangela, now, she made
a bold decision
to do today's country look.
- She didn't do it for me.
And I understand, you know,
the whole "I want it to be
current
and I want it to be now
country,"
like...fine.
But someone's paying you to do
something, sweetie;
you gotta deliver on that.
- I almost don't even remember
it,
it was so middle of the road.
- If you have to explain it,
it's not being projected.
It was a fail.
-<i> Yara Sofia!</i>
- That body is near-perfection.
- But with that said,
that voice is still there.
- [laughs]
- And I don't ever want to hear
her record again, just FYI.
[RuPaul laughing]
- I don't know, I thought she
had guts to get up here.
She sparkled.
I liked her.
-<i> Carmen Carrera.</i>
- The best thing about it for me
was the outfit.
- I saw...some style with
no substance.
- I think she's too
self-conscious
about looking anything other
than sexy.
- Right.
- And I do think she has the
goods,
like she's not moving past this
point of posing.
- That's her crutch.
So she really doesn't have to
bring anything else.
-<i> Raja.</i>
- A lot of performing
is owning it.
Raja just owned it.
- She walked out with those
Doc Martens
<i>and that little plaid number,</i>
<i>and I'm like, she got it!</i>
- She can study a look,
and she can get it,
and she works it on the runway,
but when it comes to emoting,
she's fallen short.
And, Michelle, you've seen this.
Do you think she's broken
through that?
- I think this was so in touch
with the core of who she is
that we can't really judge if
she's broken through or not.
- She represented the strongest
type of woman,
which I find so attractive.
And I wouldn't mind if she,
uh...
well, I guess she wouldn't need
to strap it on.
- No!
[laughter]
- Silence!
I've made my decision.
Bring back...my girls.
<i>Welcome back, ladies.</i>
Now, based on your performance
on the main stage,
I've made some decisions.
Yara Sofia, your performance
was graceful...
but your power ballad ran
out of gas.
You're safe.
Raja, the judges OD'ed on your
punk performance.
God save the queen.
<i>You are the winner</i>
<i>of this challenge.</i>
And you've won an original
custom gown by Marcomarco
from the House
of Infinite Radness.
-<i> I feel fantastic.</i>
Grew up being a little punk kid,
so it was kind of nice to get
to live that look.
And I deserve to win.
-<i> Carmen Carrera...</i>
Your reggae was half-baked,
and your performance went up
in smoke.
I'm sorry, my dear, but you are
up for elimination.
- Oh...God!
<i>I was in the bottom two</i>
<i>last time,</i>
<i>so for me, it's do or die.</i>
- Manila.
Your disco look rocked the boat.
You're safe.
Shangela.
Your attempt to explain away
your new country look
fell on deaf ears.
Alexis Mateo, your hip-hop was
just too damn strip hop.
Alexis Mateo...
You are safe.
- Thank you.
- Shangela, my dear, you are up
for elimination.
-<i> When Ru says that I'm in the</i>
<i>bottom two,</i>
my heart is beating so loudly
<i>because it's not time for me</i>
<i>to go home.</i>
<i>It's not.</i>
- Two queens.
Stand before me.
<i>Ladies, this is your last</i>
<i>chance</i>
to impress me and save yourself
from elimination.
The time has come...
for you to lip sync...
for your life!
Good luck and don't...
fuck it up.
[music begins]
- It hurts me to say that
Shangela's kind of turning it
out.
<i>I mean, I'm rootin' for my</i>
<i>girl,</i>
but Carmen might be in trouble.
- Ooh!
[song ends]
- [whooping, whistling]
- Ladies...
I've made my decision.
Shangela...shante, you stay.
- [exhales]
Thank you.
[whispers]
-<i> Carmen Carrera...</i>
<i>my jersey girl.</i>
<i>You're a fierce queen.</i>
Do you believe in life after
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race?</i>
Because I believe in you.
Now...sashay away.
[applause]
-<i> Ru's decision's Ru's decision,</i>
<i>and I respect her decision.</i>
<i>I think in this competition</i>
<i>it's about doing it</i>
<i>and doing it the best you can,</i>
and if other people do it
better,
then that's...
the reality of it.
But I am the most beautiful one
here,
and honestly, I would have liked
to get sent home by
somebody better.
-<i> Condragulations, girls.</i>
You have been turning it out
week after week, and so don't
even think of letting up now.
Now, remember,
if you can't love yourself,
how in the hell are you gonna
love somebody else?
Can I get a amen in here?
all: Amen!
- All right,
now let the music play!
<i>- Grand prize contributed</i>
<i>in part by AlandChuck.travel.</i>


<i> Previously on</i>
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race...</i>
You'll need to perform in
a ladyboy music festival
we're calling RuPaul-a-Palooza.
 I think she's gonna rely on
what she's been relying on
this whole time:
being a loudmouth.
 Can I get a halleloo?
 God save the queen.
Raja.
You are the winner
of this challenge.
 Fuck Yes.
 Ladies.
I've made my decision.
Shangela.
Shante, you stay.
Carmen Carrera.
Sashay away.
<i>And tonight...</i>
I'm gonna give you an
opportunity to really wig out.
 [cursing in Spanish]
<i> Wigs fly.</i>
<i>And a tangled twist.</i>
[hissing like a cat]
<i>With extra special guest judges</i>
<i>Fantasia Barrino,</i>
<i>and Wayne Brady.</i>
[cheers and applause]
<i>The winner of RuPaul's</i>
<i>Drag Race will receive</i>
<i>a lifetime supply of</i>
<i>Kryolan professional makeup,</i>
<i>headline Logo's Drag Race tour,</i>
<i>featuring cocktails perfected</i>
<i>by Absolut,</i>
<i>and a cash prize of $75,000.</i>
And may the best woman win.
[car tires squealing]
 Good morning.
 We're back again.
 Top five, bitches.
 Oh, she wrote notes
for everyone.
 Says, "Raja, I love you."
Oh, my girl.
 Bye, Heather.
 I'm gonna miss her.
 In the workroom this morning
there's a huge, huge, void...
that used to be taken up
by Carmen's giant ass.
So I guess Raja, it's up to you.
You're the bitch now.
I appoint you.
 Gladly.
You know what, I've been so nice
this whole time.
And I'm not holding back
anymore.
If I win something
and I deserve it,
why not show it off
a little bit?
So I won.
 Watch out, darling.
Anything could happen.
One day you're in,
and the next day you're out.
 Suck it, bitches,
suck it, bitches.
I win, I win.
 I really don't give a fuck
about raja.
He just want to become a model,
but he's old,
and he looks like a man.
Shangela, you was
in the bottom two again.
 Oh, Lord have mercy.
 How was that, girl?
 You start to feel like,
I'm here again, why?
But you just gotta go back to,
you know--
 Yeah, wi to fi, you know?
 Who you are.
You gotta fight.
I feel like I have to work
harder to prove to everyone,
you know, that I deserve to be
here.
 And they keep talking
about you.
Like, they keep attacking you.
 'Cause they want me gone,
sister.
If Raja and Manila
really didn't think
that I was competition,
they wouldn't be
bothered about it.
They'd embrace me like Carmen.
[alarm sounds]
<i> Ooh, girl!</i>
<i>You've got shemail.</i>
Hello, ladies.
all: Hello!
 However you dippity-do it,
the next drag superstar has got
to keep her hair bouncing
and behaving.
It takes just one bad blowout.
You could be hair today,
and gone tomorrow.
And parting is such
sweet sorrow.
 Whoo.
 What?
 Something about hair, honey.
 Hello, hello, hello.
all: Hey!
 Hey, Ru.
 Now, every now and then,
we all have a bad hair day.
And that's when a ladyboy
really has to improvise.
Now for today's mini-challenge,
you need to make a dramatic
headpiece,
using only materials swiped
from the gay beach.
all: Ooh!
 Now, ladies.
You've got crabs,
beach balls,
grass skirts,
and a whole bunch of fun stuff.
Now there's 20 minutes
on the clock.
Ready.
Set.
Go!
 Yeah.
 Ooh, look at the fishy!
[high-pitched muttering]
I'm making this headpiece
with a fishy lace front.
[laughing]
 I want mine to be chic.
 Well, good luck, honey.
'Cause that looks busted
and crusted, girl.
 Honey, this is a Philip
Treacy Alexander McQueen, honey.
 Oh, you bitch.
Mama, stand up straight.
My headdress is falling over
and dying.
But at least it doesn't look as
jacked up as Shangela's.
 Ooh!
Oh.
 What kind of headpiece
is that?
Like, a parrot with a dolphin?
What the hell?
 All right, lady-kins.
all: Whoo!
 First up, let's take a look
at Raja's head.
Wow.
Now, have you had crabs before?
 Um, yeah, I actually pulled
these right out of my panties.
 [laughing]
Yara Sofia.
 Yaaaay!
 Beach party.
 Yaaaay!
 Girl, you are so fishy.
 Thank you.
It looks so real, right?
 Manila.
Showgirl.
It's very Ziegfeld.
 Although I need
a little Viagra,
or the pit crew to give it
a little inspiration.
'Cause she's starting to sag.
Like Raja!
 Alexis Mateo.
 Pat...
all: Ooh.
 I steal the head fish, bitch.
Look how I float.
 Yes, you are floating.
 I feel like in a boat fat.
Pfft!
[laughing]
 Shangela.
all: [giggling]
 Is that a parrot
humping a dolphin?
 [laughing]
 Mm-hmm.
 I don't know how natural
that is,
but somehow I'm strangely
stimulated by it.
Ladies.
You all had fun
with this challenge.
But...
I'm gonna have to go with Raja.
 Oh, shit!
 Raja is the winner of this
mini-challenge.
[laughing]
 She can jump around
and celebrate everything
that she wants to,
but I won too.
Hey.
 Ladies.
A queen's crowning glory
is her hair.
Now I'm gonna give you
an opportunity
to really wig out.
[cheers and applause]
 Oh, God.
 Oh.
 For this week's
main challenge,
you'll be competing
in a fantasy hair show.
You need to create
three distinct hairstyles.
First, a classic look
from another era.
Second, a modern look
worthy of a red carpet event.
And third, a far-out fantasy
hair extravaganza.
 Mmm, hey.
 Now, Raja.
 Yes.
 Because you won
the mini-challenge,
you get a five-second head start
at the wig bar.
 Oh!
 Provided by Wilshire Wigs.
So get going.
Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best woman win!
 [screams]
 [laughing]
 What are you doing?
The extravaganza?
 Mm-hmm.
That's the one
I'm gonna work on first,
'cause I think that'll
take me the most time.
She ain't slick.
I know what she's doing.
Yara is brushing that wig,
and walking around,
looking at
everyone's creations.
Getting ideas.
What am I gonna do?
Hmm.
 I love doing hair.
 I think Yara's gonna do
really good at this one.
 Mm-hmm.
 'Cause you always have, like,
the craziest, wackiest hair.
 And Manila, how do you think
I'm gonna do with this
challenge?
 Um, I think you'll do fine.
 [laughing]
 Shangela, this is a comb.
 Ooh, girl!
 Oh, yeah.
 It goes through the hairs.
Mm-hmm.
 Thank you, Manila.
 Just sharing the knowledge,
Honey.
 These girls don't expect me
to have any creativity
or ability when it
comes to this.
It's a fire in me
to prove them wrong.
 Our main challenge is
creating
three different looks
of hair,
matching with
three different outfits--
the classic from another era,
a modern red carpet look,
and then we have
a fantasy creation.
 Alexis.
 What happened, boo?
 Which one are you working on
right now?
 My fantasy look.
That's gonna be my hardest part
of the challenge--
is going to be
to get that look together.
I normally work with my own hair
as a base.
So I'm gonna have to see
how it goes tomorrow,
because I can
actually style the pieces
that I'm gonna wear.
 Uh-huh.
 But it's not until it's
on my head
that you actually see
the final product.
 Right.
 Alexis is probably gonna have
this weird-looking Elvis
pompadour
with, like,
an<i> Avatar</i><span style="bodyStyle"> ponytail.</i>
I mean, this is what she does.
Shangela,<i> au naturale.</i>
Do you know what you're doing
for your era?
 Donna Summer
meets Diana Ross.
 Work.
 Yara.
 Huh?
 How you doing?
 This is my '80s look.
 An '80s look?
 Fros seem to be really
popular for a classic era.
 Hello, hello, hello.
 Hola.
 Hello.
 Hi, how are things
shaping up?
 Fierce, honey, fierce.
 Well, hello there.
Alexis.
Which is your classic look?
 I think I'm going for
the 1940s.
 Well, now, during the '40s
there was a rationing
on latex titties.
 Are you serious?
 Yeah.
 '40s look.
 Yes.
 Do you have it here?
 No.
 No?
What about your
red carpet hair?
 I'm going to go for
the evening modern mohawk.
 An evening
modern mohawk style.
And where's that?
 It's not ready yet.
 It's not ready yet?
Oh, Miss Thing.
Let's talk about your hair
fantasy-stravaganza.
 I saw this pink,
and it reminded me
of that cotton candy
that you get
when you go to the circus.
 Yes, yes.
 And that's my inspiration,
the circus.
 Your inspiration is
cotton candy from the circus.
 For the circus.
 Ah.
Hi, Shangela.
 Hey, Ru.
 How you doing?
Oh, this is
your hair fantasy?
 This is it.
We're on it today.
 Wow.
 Yeah, it's kind of like
an alien princess
from the future.
 It is quite the fantasy.
And you've got
your classic hair?
 Classic hair is very
Diana Ross meets Donna Summer.
 I'd love to wear that hair.
That is beautiful.
So you not being a hair queen,
are you asking for advice
from the other girls?
Just how to put things together?
 No.
I know and I'm learning
what looks great on me.
 Mm-hmm.
 And no one can tell you
what looks best on you
but yourself.
I mean, I know it's okay
to ask for help,
but I've kind of
gotten some feedback
from the other girls
that they're over me
asking for help.
 Right.
 So I can do things on my own.
 Good, good.
You got to, 'cause, you know,
we're down to the wire now.
 That's right.
 Yara Sofia.
 Yes.
 Hi, darling.
 Hi, darling.
 Tell me about your
classic hair look.
 I made this with braids.
 Uh-huh.
 On the cover.
And I mixed two afros,
two tones.
 I see.
 Oh, wonderful, wonderful.
You know, um, Shangela is doing
a little bit
of a--sort of a '70s afro.
It's big, curly hair.
Are you worried
about that at all?
 No, well, I made it first.
And when I see Shangela's
classic hair,
it looks like mine.
Even the brunette color.
I think Shangela's a copycat.
 Hey, Raja.
 Hi.
 So tell me,
what are you planning
for your red carpet look?
 I am taking some inspiration
from Janice,
from the Muppets.
 Uh-huh.
She's my favorite muppet,
I think.
 [imitating Janice]
"Hey, man.
Yeah, it's gonna be cool."
 Yeah, uh-huh.
Artistically,
what is your fantasy?
 Well, my fantasy would never
really involve a wig,
'cause the wig would be
pulled off, but...
 [laughing]
 Uh-huh, no...
I really don't know what my hair
fantasy is, to be honest.
 Now, listen.
I just want you to know
that we expect something
truly out of this world.
 Ru wants to see something
that's just gonna wow him
and, you know, take him
to another, like,
another realm, really.
And I definitely feel
a lot of pressure.
I am about to lose my mind.
 Hey, Manila.
 Hi.
 How you doing?
 Good.
 What you got there?
Sort of a rock me disco Amadeus,
isn't it?
 This is my classic look.
 That's your classic look.
 Yeah.
I thought it may be kind of cool
to do,
like, the mix of, like,
'80s meets 1800s.
 This is not
your fantasy look?
 This is my classic look.
 'Cause that's pretty fantasy.
That's--that's out there,
isn't it?
 It's a lot to explain.
 Some of the other girls
have gotten in trouble
for having to explain
what it is they're doing.
 Yeah.
 You know, it should be clear.
 Hits you over the head.
 Yeah.
 Make sure that everyone
gets it.
 Well, to quote Alexis Mateo,
it should say, "Bam!"
 The jig is up.
 You know what I'm saying?
 I will.
 Okay.
 All right, ladies.
Gather around.
Now tomorrow, we'll be joined by
our extra special guest judges--
the talented and hilarious
Wayne Brady...
 Whoo!
 Wow.
 Brady.
 And my favorite baby mama,
Fantasia.
For real.
No, for real, though.
I'm for real.
 Fantasia won<i> American Idol,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
and I can't wait.
 In addition to debuting
your three hairstyles
on the main stage,
there's just one more
little detail
I neglected to mention.
I want you to create
a runway outfit
made entirely out of...
hair.
 [gasping] Oh, my god.
What am I going to do?
 You'll get more hair pieces,
toupees, falls, and merkins.
So y'all can really
get wiggy up in here.
 Like, really, Ru?
Really?
 Listen, the competition is
getting pretty hairy in here.
So don't fuck it up.
 Our main challenge today
is that
we're creating three
different hair looks
that has to correspond
to three different outfits,
and we have to create an outfit
out of hair!
There's so much to do,
and so little time.
You can feel the pressure on.
 We have to make a dress out
of nothing but wigs?
This is insane.
You gotta be kidding me.
 It's crazy,
that's what it is.
 That kind of changes
my whole, like, look.
 Me too.
 It's a giant challenge,
but yet it's like,
they tell you, like, later.
 Isn't that crazy, though?
That there's always a twist?
Just when you think
you have it down.
 Ooh!
Oh!
I almost melted my face.
Sabotage!
Ooh, girl!
It's jumping up in here.
[hysterical laughter]
 Are you losing it, girl?
Quit sniffing all those
adhesive fumes.
Yara is being wacky.
 [cursing in Spanish]
 But a part of me goes,
"Is she doing that
to distract the other girls
in the room?"
Oh, okay.
Miss Girl's got a strategy
of her own.
Ay! Ay! Ay!
 Oh, Christ on crackers.
 Aaiiee!
Oooh!
Aaah!
I mean, come on.
 Hee-hee-hee!
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
 Really?
 I feel like I'm in some,
like, weird alien petting zoo.
It's, like, shut up.
 If you guys had a chance
to kill one of the other queens
in this competition,
who would it be?
 Yara Sofia.
 I never win the challenge.
And this time, I have to win.
Fuck, it's about time for me.
Um, excuse me.
Excuse me.
Darling, I need help.
 What, Yara, what?
 Do you like the combination?
 I like it, I like it since
you made it.
Yara is coming to my station
every five seconds
to ask me how her look is.
I mean, we're the top five.
Ain't no time to be
talking around
or playing with each other.
This is some real shit
right now.
You'll be all right.
 I hope so.
 If Carmen was still here--
 Mm-hmm.
 She would have just taken
two wigs,
glued them to her titties.
 Called it a day.
 I'm always having problems
with the proportions of my body.
Um, the wrong way.
And this challenge, I have to
wear my body, plus hair.
So for me to actually have
a silhouette on stage,
it's gonna
be very difficult.
My fantasy dress was not going
to the right place
that I want it to.
 Alexis finish her garment,
and now she's changing the dress
and cut it.
 Oh, you changed it,
like, fiercely, huh?
 It doesn't look like circus.
 I was wondering why you cut
it all apart.
It's important for me to do well
in this challenge because,
bitch, it's the top five.
I mean, I wanna be
part of the top four.
 It's good, but I don't know
if this could bother you.
 I put it on so it sits,
like, right here.
Fits okay.
 Can you glue hair?
 This is a creative high
for me.
I don't want to look
outward for help.
 It doesn't have to cover
the entire front.
 Okay, awesome.
 Just a design.
 Thank you.
 Shangela's outfit is a mess.
Hey, girl, listen.
You should learn
some new things.
 Have you tried your wig
on yet?
 I haven't even started it.
 This is all good in theory,
but let's see if it
actually stays on my head.
 This wig is, like, super,
like, Halloween-y.
I don't know what the fuck
I'm doing anymore.
In<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> history, this might</i>
be the craziest and hardest
and most stressful
challenge ever.
Time is getting shorter
and shorter and shorter.
 Piece of shit.
 Ow, son of a mother fucking
bitch!
It's do it or die.
[alarm clock buzzing]
 Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God, oh, my God.
 Today, the clock is ticking,
honey.
Nobody's ready yet.
We are going crazy.
 I'm nervous,
'cause I still have to do
my modern, worthy of
a red carpet look.
 There's just so much
for everyone to do,
that everyone's really feeling
the pressure right now.
 I'm stressed out of
my fucking mind.
I can feel the veins
in my temples
and in my neck just pulsating
with, like--
[inhales]
I just need to get it done.
 Ready or not,
here comes mama.
 Manila, you're getting ready
already?
What about your modern look?
 Honey, I'm gonna
make it work.
It's gonna be a shake and go,
honey.
 Did you finish everything?
 Stop talking to me.
 Ha ha!
Bitch.
 I just wanna
get myself painted,
'cause if I'm in the bottom
and I have to lip-synch,
I at least want to be pretty
when I do it.
 I don't feel like
I'm gonna be there.
I've worked really hard.
I'm confident
in what I'm bringing.
 This has to be the most
difficult challenge so far.
But I'm actually finding
that I'm a lot better
at doing hair
than I thought I was.
 I've always wanted to be
in drag,
even when I was a little boy.
I used to sneak into
my sister's closet
and take all of her clothes
and wear them around.
 Drag made me be
who I want to be
whenever I wanted it to be.
It just gives me that freedom.
 Freedom.
 Yeah, it's like a vacation.
You can take a vacation
every night.
 Exactly.
And you get paid for it,
and it's even better.
To me, it's like
my artistic expression.
 It's--I know,
it's your creation.
 Everybody cannot do drag.
 I think everybody
should have the right
to do drag if they want to,
even if they look busted.
I'm here.
 Mm-hmm.
When I started it,
like, I was kind of like,
"Am I an attractive person?"
 I look pretty, and that's--
 [laughs]
And that's it.
 Some people use drag
as an escape.
Like they don't feel
that they--
 Yes, it's true.
 I agree.
'Cause I started so young.
I needed something to boost
my self-esteem, you know?
And people--people finally
told me I was beautiful.
The biggest difficulty for me,
though,
has been, like, people
who you know or knew people
don't know the real you.
They only know your character.
So they start only calling you
by your character name,
or, like, they only want to
see you in drag.
And then if you show up
and you're not in drag,
they're like,
"Oh, where's Shangela tonight?"
 But for Alexis,
that's not a problem.
 [laughs]
 No, I don't--
I don't know if that's true,
because, I mean, RuPaul, like,
you know, half the time here--
 I'm not talking about RuPaul;
I'm talking about me.
 It all starts to become
one person after a while.
 Raja's first picture of her
in drag is an oil painting.
[laughter]
 No, bitch,
it's a cave painting.
 No, it's one of
those pictures
where they have to have
the big flash that explodes
when you take the picture.
 My problem with drag
is the dating scene.
 It is kind of hard.
 My situation that, every time
you're gonna date somebody,
you feel like you just--
 Have to hide it.
 You just have to come
out of the closet.
 Yes.
And then when you're going out
for the night,
and you intend on going out
and hooking up with someone,
you have to make sure
that you put all your drag
up in the closet
and all the sequins
off the floor,
all the rhinestones.
 It is true.
But that was at the beginning.
 Now I don't care.
 Ha!
 [laughs]
Hey, guys.
Welcome to the main stage of
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
Hey, Michelle, we're going back
to our roots tonight.
 Aren't we, baby?
 Santino.
Now are you gonna be
splitting hairs
with our girls tonight?
 Oh, you know this.
 Wayne Brady!
I'm so glad you're here.
 Hey, you.
I am so happy to be here.
And Fantasia.
 Ooh!
 Hi, Ru.
 This week, our queens
were challenged
to compete in
a fantasy hair show
and create three
distinct hairstyles,
which includes a runway outfit
made entirely out of hair.
Gentlemen...
start your engines.
And may the best woman win.
The first looks are their
classic hairstyles
from a past era-era-uh.
Yara Sofia.
Oh, she's got a disco feeling.
 I'm bringing this '70s look.
With such an inspiration.
And I feel flawless.
 She loves the nightlife.
 Studio 54.
 Alexis Mateo.
Bring the fur, baby.
 [laughing]
 My classic look
is all glamour.
Hollywood.
The golden age.
 The drama.
 Looks like she was outside
trapping some animals too.
 A girl's gotta eat.
 Look at Raja.
Very '60s.
 Ooh!
 Yes, hey!
 Twiggy!
 Yes.
 That girl.
 I just wanted her
to feel really sweet,
a little bit like
a sex-cretary in the '60s.
A little<i> Mad Men.</i>
 Oh, I love a nude pump.
That's Raja from
the secretarial pool.
 Sex in the '60s.
 [laughing]
 Shangela.
Uh-oh, I smell a costume change.
 [laughing]
 I'm a Spanish flamenco sister
all the way from Barcelona.
And I'm loving it.
 Ooh,<i> el motivar.</i>
<i>Toro, toro!</i>
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Ole.
 Oh, and she popped the fan.
 Yes, she popped that fan.
 She popped something.
 Manila.
 She's giving you
Marie Antoinette meets<i> Shaft.</i>
 Yes.
 Blonde Venus.
 Is she "rock me Amadeus"
from the '80s?
 I have a powdered wig going.
I have my little, like,
curls on the side.
And I'm feeling fierce,
and the judges are living.
Oh, look at all the cameos.
 And look at the candelabra
in her hair.
 Oh, yes.
That's a candelabra.
This is their modern
red carpet look.
From Yara Sofia.
Wow.
Desperate housewife.
 There's a little J-Lo
in that one.
 I'm giving the judges
a very strong haircut
like Rihanna, for example.
 I'm going to the Emmys.
 It's very Roberto Cavalli.
 Sexy urban camo.
 Yes, it is.
Alexis Mateo.
She's ready for the ALMA awards.
 For my red carpet
modern look,
I make an evening mohawk.
And it's very modern,
it's very couture.
 A little new school Mae West.
 Yes, she is.
 Yeah, there you go.
She's trying life as a blonde.
 Just a little bit at a time.
 Yeah.
 Raja.
Britt Ekland.
Ooh.
 Okay.
 Easy breezy.
 I cut this hair.
This is something
that I razored on my own.
And I am ruling that runway.
All I can hear in my ears are
electric guitars and keyboards.
 Vidal Sassoon.
Shangela.
Miss Diahann Carroll is
in the house.
 Yes, she is.
 I'm daytime class.
So I'm coming down the runway
giving you Diahann Carroll
at the Oprah's Legends ball.
And I'm feeling fierce.
 Red carpet.
 Oh, she gave you a wedge.
 Yes.
I think she's pumpin'
to bump it.
Manila.
 Audrey Hepburn there.
 Well, she's more
Jennifer Love Hewitt's version
of Audrey Hepburn.
 Yes.
 I'm walking down the runway,
and I feel like Audrey Hepburn
in<i> Breakfast at Tiffany's,</i>
or Barbara Streisand.
 She has borrowed those jewels
from Harry Winston.
 Of course.
 The security guard
is backstage.
 Waiting for me.
 This is their fantasy hair
extravaganza.
Yara Sofia.
 Oh!
 Oh!
 Take that, Bjork.
 How much is that poodle
on the runway?
 For the fantasy,
I'm wearing this hairy dress.
It's like a scorpion on the top.
I feel so fabulous.
 I made a purse out
of Shirley Temple.
 Oh, yes.
 Won't get out of place.
 I see her fantasy
is doggy style.
Alexis Mateo.
 Oh!
 Phantom of the drag queens.
 Yes.
 I look like a ballerina
in a circus.
I'm loving it.
It just screams Alexis Mateo
from far away.
 Thighs wide open.
 Yes, hunty.
Wild, wild west.
Miss Kitty never looked so good.
Raja.
Hair fantasy.
 Wow.
 I'm so happy with
what I've created.
It looks like this beautiful,
like, cotton candy
frothy milkshake.
 Earth girls are easy!
 Yes.
Yes, Rainbow Brite.
 She's like a snow cone.
 Oh, my gosh.
 Shangela.
 Ooh!
 Ooh!
 Mad Max.
 Ooh, She-man the barbarian.
 The minute I hit that runway,
I am alien warrior princess,
and I'm coming for you.
 Two queens enter,
one queen leaves.
 [laughing]
 Beyond the merkin-dome.
 Ooh!
I wanna see that in 3-D.
 Mm-hmm.
 Manila.
 What you buzzin' 'bout?
 Yes, honey.
Honeybee.
 I'm feeling cute
and floating around
on the runway, like,
from flower to flower.
 She's pollinating the runway.
 She is.
 Buzz, buzz, buzz.
Welcome, ladies.
Your runway was absolutely
hair-raising.
And now it's time
for the judges' critique.
Let's start with Yara Sofia.
Tell me about
your fantasy extravaganza.
 For me, the word
"extravaganza" means an animal.
 The word "extravaganza"
to you means an animal,
like a scorpion and a poodle.
 Scoodle.
 I made this, um, scorpion,
um, curve.
 Uh-huh.
 And I feel very hairy.
Very hairy.
 [laughing]
Well, girl, you are hairy.
 [raspy groan]
 [laughing]
 It's very Dr. Seuss.
You're like a beautiful woman
from Whoville.
 Don't take this the bad way,
but, like, you're like the ho
of Whoville.
 [laughing]
 A "who-ho."
 A "who-ho."
 Yeah, a "who-ho."
Horton heard a ho.
Who--I love that.
 Right. Right.
 I love that.
 Fantasia, what did you think
of her classic look?
 Um, it reminds me so much of
my aunties.
How, you know,
how they used to do it.
And they used to rock it well.
And I want the outfit.
 Thank you.
 Do you think I can wear
that outfit?
 Yes, I can make a few ones.
 I got a lot of junk
in my trunk.
 Don't worry, darling.
 Okay, good.
 Next up, Alexis Mateo.
Hi, mami.
 Hi, Ru.
Hi, judges.
 Let's start with the best,
which is this look here.
Your fantasy look.
When you came out,
I totally got circus girl.
Your red carpet look that was
supposed to be very modern,
the hair was kind of like
budget RuPaul, in a way.
I mean, it was like, uh,
I don't know what award show
you would have worn that to.
 What I don't understand is,
you do the modern red carpet,
and it looks like you're wearing
the red carpet.
You know, all along I've been
telling you,
I don't understand why certain
things you wear
that makes your body look bigger
and malproportioned.
 But I felt like a star
walking on that runway, so...
I would wear my dress with my
mohawk to my red carpet event.
And I would wear this
for the circus as well.
 [laughing]
 So bam!
[all laughing]
 Up next, Raja.
Hi, Raja.
 Hi.
 What inspired your look?
 The big mission I had
with this
is to make it
not look like hair.
 I love the outfit.
You have beautiful legs.
 They're wooden, by the way.
 [laughing]
I'll take them, I'll take them.
 Thank you, Fantasia.
Now all the way from
the Colombian coffee fields--
 [laughing]
 Let's go to Juan Valdez.
 You look completely, like,
Japanime art.
And as for your red carpet look,
I liked your take on it.
It was definitely like
a young rocker.
Love the hair.
The razor cut.
If I could have one critique,
it's that I think you look
even more beautiful
with less makeup on.
 Your '60s look,
I put that you're like a sexy,
dark Goldie Hawn,
circa<i> Laugh-In.</i>
And you looked really natural
and real,
and that looked like that could
be you walking the streets.
 Next up...
Shangela.
 Hi, Ru.
 Where'd you get
the inspiration
for your fantasy outfit?
 You know,
I love sci-fi films.
I love horror,
scarier films.
 Wait, what did you call me?
 Ooh!
 For the classic look,
I felt the dress
was a little too big.
I just would have loved to have
seen it be a little tighter,
'cause this figure that I'm
seeing right now...
[clicks tongue, imitates sizzle]
Hot.
 Sometimes, just having one
solid look
works better than having kind of
like two mediocre looks,
because after you took
that big coat off,
you still had kind of
a big gunny sack of a dress on
underneath it.
Your modern red carpet look,
it looked more kind of like the
high-class executive secretary.
It just wasn't quite there
to a red carpet event.
 I felt like I was going to,
like, Oprah's Legends ball.
 Montecito.
 That's right.
It was a daytime look.
 Why would you pick a daytime
red carpet?
 I'm an E! fan.
They have carpets all day long.
 Yeah, you could wear that on
the red carpet.
Would E! stop you
to talk to you and ask you,
"Who did your hair?"
No, they'd probably go,
"Eh, she did her hair."
But you appear to be
very fearless
just like your dressed--
you know, when I was a kid,
I was a big fan of D&amp;D,
and you look like a D&amp;D heroine.
 Wait a minute, that's
Dungeons &amp; Drag Queens?
 Yes, that's
Dungeons &amp; Drag Queens.
 Next up, Manila.
 Hi, Ru.
Hi, judges-zzzzzz.
 Hi, Manila.
 I loved the classic.
I want the dress.
I want the boots.
I loved everything about
the classic look.
 Who wears a tiara
to a red carpet?
 I would.
 Hey, girl.
 Hey!
 We queens, Santino.
 Thank you.
 Get into it.
 [laughing]
I really just felt that, uh,
enormous central necklace
made your beautiful neck
and this whole area just
kind of look a little mannish.
 Okay.
 Thank you, Pancho Villa.
 [laughing]
 So, Manila, I can just
eat you
with a spoon tonight.
And what I love most about you
as a drag queen
is your ability
to theme couture.
Like, you always have these
great themes.
 A love of fashion
and insects,
you don't find that
in a woman.
 No, you don't.
 Good job.
 Thank you, ladies.
I think we've heard enough.
While you go and untuck
in the Interior Illusions
lounge,
the judges and I
will deliberate.
You may leave the stage.
[car engine starting up]
Okay, kids.
We're gonna start with
Yara Sofia.
She was our scorpion poodle.
 Scoodle.
 She really brought it
to the fantasy level.
 I thought she tore it up.
The '70s look was
out of control.
The hair was gorgeous.
I loved the big gold hoops.
I want that outfit.
 Is it wrong that I think
that the booty is so amazing?
 No.
 It's juicy, honey.
 Yes.
 Yeah, you know, this kinda
messes with
your perception of things.
 It does.
 Oh, my goodness.
 It wrecks your head, honey.
 Now you see what happened to
Eddie Murphy.
 [laughing]
 What?
 Alexis Mateo.
 She looked like she was
coming from
a Bell Biv Devoe video.
 [laughing]
She didn't look like--
she didn't look like
a Hollywood starlet.
 That '40s look, there was
nothing '40s about it.
Maybe $40.
 Oh, okay.
 And that's about it.
 All right.
Do think that her red carpet
look was too regional?
 She wore the red carpet
and spangled it.
 Miss Raja.
all: [laughing]
 I love her.
When she walked out,
it was that look of,
"Even if you don't like it,
"the way I'm about to walk out
here with it,
you're gonna like it."
 Sell the garment.
 I would say, although
she really worked it
and gave us that rock and roll
kind of
first time at the Grammys
kind of young rocker look,
I do wish maybe
she would have brought it
in a more conventional way,
because I would love to see
what Raja
would wear to the Oscars.
 It's probably more realistic
to think that she would
do something
that looks like
a red carpet gown,
instead of going Miley Cyrus.
 Shangela.
 You know what?
She reminds me
so much of myself,
just with being the underdog.
With going into something
and saying,
"You know what?
"I might not have this,
"I might not have that,
but I'm gonna give it my all."
 All of those things
that you said,
Fantasia, I love about her.
And that's really why
she's still here.
 Yes.
 Because as far as her
fashion sense, her style...
she is clueless.
 Is anybody else seeing
the five o'clock shadow
consistently?
 It's not
a five o'clock shadow,
it's actually
the shade of makeup,
and it's her highlighting.
 So it's picking up where--
 She's not blending it
very well; that's what it is.
 I do think that Shangela has
an amazing spirit
and I think may be pursuing
the wrong thing,
because there are clearly
other people
who eat, breathe, sleep this,
and it comes out of their pores.
 Manila.
 Wasn't a big fan
of the fantasy.
Love, love, love the classic.
She had an afro and she had some
curls on the side.
I'm thinking, "Who does that?
And who pulls it off
like she did?"
 As for her red carpet look,
I think she just kind of
overworked the jewelry.
 I don't know, she did it
for me tonight.
 All right.
Silence!
I've made my decision.
Bring back...
my girls.
Ladies.
Based on your performance
and your presentation
on the main stage,
I've made some decisions.
Raja.
You served three hot looks.
And your cotton candy fantasy is
truly delicious.
You're safe.
 Thanks.
 Yara Sofia.
This week, you scoodled
your way to victory.
Condragulations.
You are the winner
of this challenge.
 [cursing in Spanish]
 [laughing]
 And you've won an Alaskan
cruise for two
from America's number one
gay travel specialist,
alandchuck.travel.
 Do you know what, darling?
It's about time.
It is so good to finally
win a challenge.
 Alexis Mateo.
You are a timeless queen.
But some of your hairstyles were
a little dated
and off the mark.
I'm sorry, my dear, but you are
up for elimination.
 I don't wanna go home.
I wanna stay in this competition
all the way till the end.
 Manila.
You rocked
three very different looks.
And your fantasy bee was killer.
You're safe, honey.
Shangela.
You are a sharp queen.
But I'm afraid your hairstyles
didn't make the cut.
I'm sorry, my dear, but you are
up for elimination.
 Wow, I'm back here...again.
And, you know, it's really tough
having to lip-synch against
a friend in this competition.
 Two queens stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me
and save yourselves...
from elimination.
The time has come for you to
lip-synch for your life.
Good luck.
And don't...
fuck it up.
 The lip-synch is a beautiful
song by Fantasia.
Shangela is doing
the best she can,
but Alexis is, like,
feeling it with her body,
and it's timeless and beautiful.
[applause]
 Yes!
 Yes.
 Ladies.
I've made my decision.
Alexis Mateo.
Shante, you stay.
 [whispers] Thank you.
 Shangela.
No one can say you didn't
try your hardest.
And it's that drive
that will take you far.
Live your dreams, mama.
Now, sashay away.
 Thank you all.
Thank you.
[applause]
 Halleloo!
 Halleloo!
It's a sad feeling because
I definitely came back
into this competition
wanting to win.
And it's not been easy.
But I'm leaving a winner.
And it's just a lesson
for everyone
who's ever wanted to pursue
any dream they've had.
Live your passion.
And live it to the fullest.
Halleloo!
 Well, ladies.
As you know, each week
I consult with the judges,
but the final decision
is mine to make.
It seems that I've been
criticized
for sending some of my queens
home too soon.
Michelle.
 Yes?
 I want you to confer
with Santino and Billy B.
to decide which of
the eliminated queens...
deserve to return
to this competition...
next week.
 Oh, my God.
Are you freaking kidding me?
 And you may pick from
any of the queens
eliminated this season.
Will it be...
Venus D-Lite?
Phoenix?
Mimi Imfurst?
India Ferrah?
Mariah?
Stacy Layne Bryant Matthews?
Delta Work?
Carmen Carrera?
Or Shangela Laquifa Wadley?
Now.
Remember...
if you can't love yourself,
how in the hell you gonna
love somebody else?
Can I get an amen in here?
all: Amen!
 All right!
Now let the music play!

-<i> Previously</i>
<i>on</i><span style="bodyStyle"> RuPaul's Drag Race...</i>
It's time to get totally
leotarded!
- Sha! Sha!
[speaking Spanish]
- Stretch...
- [exhaling rhythmically]
- Alexis, you are the winner.
Stacy, we feel
you are holding back.
But you're safe for now.
- I'll bring it.
- Ladies, this is your last
chance to impress me.
- Bitch, step it up.
You gotta make sure
that you're always
the one that's in front.
- Mimi Imfurst.
Drag is not a contact sport.
India Ferrah, shantay, you stay.
- Whoo!
<i>- And tonight...</i>
<i>Escandalo!</i>
The dolls hit the red carpet.
- Ohh! Ha ha!
- And things get steamy.
- Oh! Ohh!
- With extra-special
guest judges
Chloe Sevigny
and Debbie Matenopoulos.
The winner of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i>
will receive
a lifetime supply
of Kryolan Professional makeup;
headline Logo's Drag Race Tour,
featuring cocktails
perfected by Absolut;
and a cash prize of $75,000.
And may the best woman win!
[car engines racing]
- Another day.
- Good morning.
- Life is too short to lift
someone else.
- Girl, y'all gonna lift me.
[laughter]
- Being in the bottom two,
it's a very serious thing.
It kind of like lit a light bulb
in my head.
I have to, like, fight harder
now, so...
- Speaking of fighting.
[laughs]
When Mimi lifted you up,
I was like,
y'all didn't have to grab me.
- Yeah.
- 'Cause you know I was ready
to come out there.
I was coming out in my ponytail
and everything.
- I know everyone expected me
to, like,
punch her or something,
when she did that.
No, I'm not a violent person.
I just gotta go on,
focus on the competition
and what I have to do.
- Oh, so now you competin'.
- Now I'm gonna kick you--
- Oh, so now I gotta go home.
Alliances in this competition
are very important.
India is someone that
I can share some tea with
and not think it's gonna
come back around to me
from another mouth.
- Girl, I'm just, you know,
hoping I can wear something that
I don't have to wear
my breast plate with.
- And that we don't have to sew.
- Thank god I don't have big
flower patterns anymore.
- Listen,
be strong in your opinions.
Say you don't have another
chance,
so you better bring it
every time you get out there.
- They wanna see who I am.
Miss Visage said she didn't know
if I'm a bitch,
if I'm a sweetheart.
- She doesn't know
your personality.
- Mm-hmm.
- What is your personality?
Do I need to know?
[laughs]
[siren blares]
- Ooh, girl!
You've got shemail.
Today's drag queen on the go
needs to stay abreast
of current events,
whether she tweets, blogs,
or just talks smack
behind some t-girl's back.
Remember, an informed queen
is a winning queen,
and that's the way it is.
Good night, and good tuck.
[laughing]
[all groan]
Hello, hello, hello.
[all cheer]
To make it today, young stars
have to be in control
of their public image.
For this week's mini-challenge,
you need to create
a quick drag look
for an outrageous photo op
on the red carpet.
You have ten minutes
to pull it together
before the photographers from
Polite in Public arrive.
The two queens that create
the most sensational
paparazzi photo
will win this mini-challenge.
Ready, set...
<i>Escandalo!</i>
[laughing]
- Drag, girls!
- Ooh, scandal!
- The first thing I think about
is, like, the crotch shot.
In order to create a fake vag,
it's all about the way that you
tuck and fold your skin.
I noticed Shangela was kind of
doing something similar.
I could put on a pair of
pantyhose and put on some fuzz,
you know, but this is,
like, real.
It's like a double take.
- All right, here we go.
- Oh!
- You're gonna get
three pictures.
- Okay.
- Make them count.
Are you ready?
- Yes!
- Okay, one, two, three.
Doggie-style.
All right.
Yes.
- I'm just so pandalicious.
- Oh, you're a panda!
- Oh, wow.
That's a Carrera
I'd like to drive.
- So is it okay that my face
is not gonna be in the frame?
I mean, 'cause it's about here.
- Yeah, whatever you wanna do.
And I appreciate you sharing
your inner dialogue,
but we're gonna take that
picture right now.
- Okay.
- One, two, three!
Girl, you put the junk
in junket.
- India Ferrah is here.
Yes, Miss Jackson
if you're nasty,
you better
put that nipple away.
Scandal!
Yes, take that, Harvey Levin.
Wow, look at the size
of that rock.
And that ring's not bad, either.
Ooh, that was scandalous.
- Kind of basing this off
real life, a little bit.
- You have a similar story?
- We won't--
we'll talk about it later.
- Fantastic.
- Hey, Shakira.
<i>Uno, dos, tres!</i>
<i>Escandalo.</i>
The red bow tie really dresses
that outfit up.
Something tells me your tuck's
gonna come undone.
- Let's just make sure that
doesn't happen.
We need a plug.
[laughter]
- Oh, my goodness.
Did you forget something?
- Yes, my bra.
- [laughing]
- Yabba dabba don't.
Oh, girl.
- Can we like--bloob is out?
- Yes, I love it. I love it.
Fantastic.
Nobody said you can't do that.
[southern accent]
One, two, three.
It's nipple-gate!
- Ohh!
- [laughing]
- I'm giving him hairy coochie
and toilet tissue shoe.
You don't think you would
double-click?
Aah!
- Now, I reviewed
your scandalous photos,
and I'm proud to say
you all are whores!
[laughter]
Now, news travels fast.
So to see which two queens
have hit the blogs,
let's go to the WOW Report.
Carmen Carrera
is one of our winners.
- Oh, my god.
[laughing]
I look crazy.
- For the next winner,
let's go to newnownext.com.
[all whoop]
- Stacy Layne Matthews.
- Oh, my god, you know,
finally my fat ass
has won something.
So these bitches better
watch the fuck out.
- Condragulations.
You are the queens
of morning television.
all: Ooh.
- For today's main challenge,
you'll split into two teams
to broadcast
a morning news show.
Each team consists of
two co-anchors,
a weather girl, a gossip gal,
and a roving reporter,
who'll be interviewing
celebrity guest
Kristin Cavallari.
all: Ohh.
- Carmen and Stacy,
you are our team captains.
Stacy, you get to pick first.
- I just hope Stacy
don't pick me.
Because that team is going to
crash and burn.
- Alexis.
- Manila.
- Ooh!
- Shangela.
- Ooh.
- Mm, Raja.
- Come on, girl, that's it.
- Yara Sofia.
- Delta Work.
- India and Mariah are
the two girls left standing.
- Mariah Carey.
- Me?
- Is she here?
- India Ferrah,
you are on Carmen's team.
- I end up with India.
She was in the bottom
last challenge,
and I don't want to
have to baby anybody.
- These are your news teams.
You will broadcasting live.
- What?
- Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best newswoman win.
- I would like to be...glossy.
Just serious but funny
at the same time.
- Okay.
- You know what I mean?
- Are we gonna take this, like,
more on a serious note?
- I don't know--what,
you're the team leader.
You tell me.
Is it gonna be like fun-serious
or fun, like spoof?
- We gonna have to figure out
this as a team.
Right now,
Stacy is actually clueless.
- I'm gonna be
the gossip reporter,
because I love to
fuckin' gossip.
- News anchor one
is gonna be Raja.
News anchor two
is going to be...
Delta.
Who wants to do weather girl?
No one wants to be weather girl.
But I don't really see it
for India to be interviewer,
because India can get boring
sometimes.
You're gonna be
the roving reporter.
- Okay, work.
I'll do the interview.
- Weather girl
is gonna be India.
- So I end up with weather girl,
and, honestly, I'm hating it.
But what kind of weather girl?
What should I wear?
- Let's just do a quickie,
just so we get used to it.
- Live from the QNN news center,
I'm Raja Fantaja.
- I'm Carmen Carrera,
and I've got all the tea
in my kiki report.
- Weather girl.
- Oh, is it me now?
- I'm worried for India
a little bit.
- Hey, uh, does anyone know
how much time we have?
- We have like
an hour and a half or so.
- Our main challenge
is to split into two teams
and create a morning news show.
- Remember this?
- Oh, with a bow on it.
- Yeah, this is
my newscaster look.
- Yeah, mine's kind of
muted too,
so that'll look good.
Delta and I have
a great dynamic together
and a chemistry.
So we knew that the banter
was going to be great.
- So what do you think?
What do you got?
- Yeah, I have no clue.
- I've got this.
It's a little skirt and jacket.
- Oh, yeah, that'll work.
Right?
- Is that, like, too bright?
- No, we're drag queens, honey.
- I feel that India
is a little bit
more concerned about her outfit
rather than her character
and knowing her lines.
Last time
she didn't do so good,
so it's like now I want her
to really prove herself.
I really want her to do well.
- I-I don't understand this one.
Like, just how nippy--
can you say this for me?
- Nippy, it's like cold.
- No, I know, I know.
But it's--
- It's getting a bit nippy
out there.
- I asked Stacy if
I could be the weather girl.
Even though speaking English
is kind of difficult.
- Hell, no, storm brewing
deep in the heart of Texas.
- Um, um, Shangela, could you...
- I can say it in Spanish.
- I'm listening to Yara
actually deliver her lines,
and I'm getting a little
worried, you know.
I picked this bitch
for a reason.
She better deliver.
- Hello, hello, hello!
all: Hi.
- So, Carmen,
you're a team captain again.
- Yeah.
- So what roles did you assign?
- Well, I'm gonna be
the gossip girl.
- Okay.
- We're gonna have Manila
interview.
- What is your interview style?
- I'm kind of channeling, like,
the best queens of interview.
- Like who?
- Like Mario Lopez
or Ryan Seacrest.
- Ah, okay, I love it.
[laughter]
- Raja is anchor one.
- Have you ever done
any anchoring before?
Any teleprompter?
- No, but I've pretended
quite a bit when I'm alone.
[laughter]
- And then we have Delta's
anch--uh, anchor two.
- From the desert to the sea,
to wherever there's tea.
- [laughing]
Is that your tagline?
- That's our tagline.
- I love it!
That's perfect.
- [singsong]
Bo-ring.
- Mm-hmm.
- Um, we're gonna have India
as the weather girl.
That may be the hardest part.
- Yes, it might be.
But, you know, I'm kind of going
with a little ghetto twist.
- Uh-huh.
- You know,
because you gotta be like,
"Girl, you know, it's gettin'
sunny outside, so..."
- That's you being ghetto?
- Yeah.
- [laughing] Oh, that's...
Well, I can't wait.
I know you all
have a lot of work to do,
a lot of makeup to put on.
I'm gonna let you get to work.
- The opening, the opening.
I love the opening.
- Okay.
- Well, hello,
team Stacy Layne Matthews.
all: Hi.
- How's it going?
- It's going great, honey.
- So who's who?
- Yara is our, um, weather girl.
- Okay.
- You know miss Shangela,
honey, she's our own
gossip columnist.
- Okay.
- This is my sidekick,
reporter number two.
And this is our roving reporter.
- How are you faring
as a team leader?
- I think I'm doing good, and,
you know, we all just organizing
things, you know, and it's--
- You said we all organizing.
You're organizing,
or we all organizing?
- We're working as a group.
- So now, you've made yourself
one of the anchors, right?
- Yes.
- You got some criticism
from the judge panel
that you weren't, you know,
you're not really the most
outrageous person on the planet.
- I can be.
- I'm...we wanna see that.
- Being from a small town,
it just sets me apart
from the other competition,
because I'm a little rough
around the edges.
I'm not as polished
as the other girls,
but, you know, I represent.
- Now, Yara, you're gonna be
working on a green screen.
Practice with me.
If the map of the United States
was behind you,
where is Florida?
- Florida's right here.
- Yeah.
Where's Maine?
- Maine?
- Maine.
- Where is Maine?
- Uh, now, where's New York?
- Um, right there.
- Yes.
And where's the North Pole?
- Ah, over there.
[laughter]
- Now, Alexis, you're gonna be
reading off of a teleprompter.
Do you feel comfortable
with that?
- I just gonna hope
that I do very well.
This is gonna be
a learning experience.
- Now, Mariah, you're gonna be
the roving reporter.
- Yes, I get to interview
Kristin.
I'm going to first start out
with where she's from.
Touch base on, you know,
her achievements
on film and television,
and then I also
want to touch base
on some of her charitable works.
- How much time do you have?
- Three minutes.
- Three minutes
is not a lot of time.
- I have an outline,
and I have base points
to touch on,
and I'm gonna get to
every single one of those,
and they lead to
the next question.
- Right, this is really about
your own personality.
That's really
what we want to see.
Ladies, to help you get your
charisma, uniqueness,
nerve, and talent
ready for morning television,
you'll be receiving
a crash course in media training
by veteran broadcaster
Debbie Matenopoulos.
[all gasp]
You know her from<i> The View.</i>
- Bitch, we find out
that miss Debbie,
honey, from<i> The View</i>
is gonna be giving us feedback
about our performances.
I mean, this shit is, like,
serious and exciting, honey.
And I cannot wait to hear
what this bitch has got to say.
- All right, news flash:
Don't fuck it up.
- Okay.
- I'll see you all later.
All right.
all: Thank you.
- Thanks for the tip.
[upbeat music]
- Team Stacy Layne Matthews
has entered the news room.
Say hello to
Debbie Matenopoulos.
all: Hi, Debbie, how are you?
- Hi, you gorgeous creatures.
- Now, Debbie's here
to walk you through
some of the technical aspects
of being in a news room.
And then we are going
all the way live.
Three, two, one.
- This just in:
Scientists have announced a cure
for hetosexural--
heterosexuality.
I've never, you know,
been in front of a teleprompter.
Slow that shit down.
I got to read.
- Side effects include diarrhea,
sudden baldness,
and an uncro--
uncontrollable urge
to dress age inappropriately.
- Wow, that's a great discovery,
girl.
- Yes, honey.
- Yes.
- You two are the main anchors.
You have to set the tone.
So at the top of a show,
be up, up, up.
- Hey, Yara Sofia,
how are things looking
out there today?
- Down here, there is a--
hurricane carnage.
Oh!
It's just right there.
There's a barometric dropping.
Oh! Ohh!
Almost burned my ass.
Oh, my god.
- Girl!
You forced me to believe
everything you said,
although I didn't
understand a word.
Slow down<i> or</i><span style="bodyStyle"> don't even speak</i>
a word of English.
- Now
it's Shangela Laquifa Wadley.
- Now, listen, the next
drag superstar wannabes
Carmen Carrera
and Stacy Layne Matthews
were the talk of the town
after creating a huge scene
last night on the red carpet.
Honey, it was<i> escandalo!</i>
Yara Sofia,<i> escandalo?</i>
Honey chile, yes.
That's right.
- You were giving me
the attitude
that you knew exactly
what you were doing.
You were sailing the ship.
I could take a note
or two from you.
- I'm here with
Kristin Cavallari.
So...so...
all the scandal.
Around the town
with Justin Brody,
and you have Shawn--
- Justin Bobby.
- Justin Bobby.
But you've been spotted
with Nick as well.
- Who?
- Uh, Corzone.
Am I saying his name wrong?
- Nick Carzone.
- I had some facts that I didn't
have completely together.
- There are times where I have
had my facts completely wrong.
And it's okay,
as long as you can recover.
- Okay.
- Oh, my god, look at the time.
We're almost on the air!
places, people!
Places!
- It's time to go live,
and I was so scared
about my English.
And how I can deliver
my personality.
- Count it down in three, two...
- Live from the QNN news center,
Stacy Layne Matthews...
Alexis Mateo...
Yara Sofia...
Shangela Laquifa Wadley...
and Mariah.
The QNN Morning After News
starts now.
- Live from the QNN news center,
I'm Stacy Matthews.
Just in, scientists
have announced a cure
for heterosexuality.
- I am so glad that pill
just came out.
- Yes, girl.
- We're suffering
here in United States.
- Honey.
- It's time to check in
with our Drag-U-weather.
- What's going on?
Ohh!
It is raining men down there!
[speaking Spanish]
Okay! Rainbow right here!
Oh, my god, that's so gay.
But it's so good.
That's a wrap on the weather,
I'm Yara Sofia.
- Let me just say, I do think
"It's so good, but it's so gay"
is my new favorite phrase.
I love that, Yara.
Listen, honey, let me tell you.
Which A-list action hunk
is finally
coming out of the closet?
I'll just tell you this:
He's so gay, and he's so good.
Listen, it's
Shangela Laquifa Wadley,
and that's your daily
kiki report.
Back to you, Stacy and Alexis.
- Mariah, over to you, honey.
- Hi, ladies.
Good morning.
I'm here, Mariah,
with Kristin Cavallari.
So are you working
on any new projects?
- I'm working on
a shoe line right now,
which I'm really excited about.
- Oh, perfect.
I'm excited about that too.
So, were you really born
a genetic woman?
- [laughs]
I was, yes.
- Oh, darn, girls.
We can't claim her for our team.
So, back to you
in the news room, QNN.
- Well, that's all
for the Morning After News.
Stay tuned for the same news,
different anchors.
- All right, that's a wrap.
- Welcome, team Carmen!
Cock-a-doodle-doo!
It's time for the morning news!
- Pour yourself
another cup of ambition,
because this is
the Morning After News.
- Today's breaking story:
We'll have the latest on
that horrific freak accident
that killed so many innocent
little people last night.
- Loosen up some.
You two are the anchors,
and you have to drive the ship,
but you also wanna be likable.
- It's Carmen Carrera.
- Next drag superstar wannabes
Carmen Carrera
and Stacy Layne Matthews
were the talk of the town
after creating a huge scene
on the red carpet last night.
I didn't even know I was there!
- Performance is a little bit
flat.
- In Provincetown...
Massachusetts...
I'm like, "Girl, just like,
pictures what, like,
Al Roker would do."
There is the barometric
pressure.
It's dropping.
- The weather people
are the personality.
They have carte blanche to be,
"Girl!"
I'm still waiting for your
personality to come through.
India, this is the time.
- Manila, over to you.
- [Asian accent]
Thank you, Delta.
So...Kristin...
you were on two hit TV show!
Tell us, how has that
changed your life?
- It just made me move
up to L.A. and pursue acting.
- What year you born?
- Uh, '87.
- Oh! Me too.
You are the cock.
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Rooster, rooster.
- [laughing]
- When you weren't pronouncing
your Ls and your Rs,
I thought
it was a terrible decision.
But, you know what?
That never hurt Barbara Walters.
It's time for the morning news.
We are going live.
- I'm very nervous
before the broadcast,
because this team
is depending on me to do good.
So I'm just like, "Ugh."
- I'm gonna count it down...
in three, two, one.
- Live from the QNN news center,
Raja...
Delta Work...
India Ferrah...
Carmen Carrera...
and Manila Luzon.
The QNN Morning After News
starts now.
- Live from the QNN news center,
I am Raja.
- And I'm Delta Work.
- Lookin' sexy.
- So do you.
I love you in pink.
- Thanks.
- [gasps]
- Now let's go to the gal
with all the gossip,
it's Carmen Carrera.
- Ugh, I have so much tea
for you.
Which A-list action hunk
is finally
coming out of the closet?
Well, let's just say
he was at my house last night.
both: Ooh!
- Well, it's time to check in
with our Drag-U-weather girl.
Hey, India, how are things
looking out there today?
- Now...deep in the heart
of Texas, y'all--
y'all feelin' me?
There is a hell no storm.
Okay?
In the heartland,
a rainbow has appeared
in the Gayville
of South Dakota.
This is India Ferrah
with Drag-U-weather.
Back to you, Raja and Delta.
- Thanks, weather grr.
Manila, over to you.
- [Asian accent]
Kristin!
Now that the final episode
of<i> The Hills</i><span style="bodyStyle"> has aired,</i>
what's next?
- Right now,
I'm really focusing
on my shoe line
that I'm designing.
- Oh, shoes.
I love shoes.
- I think every girl
loves shoes.
- You don't have boyfriend?
- I don't, I'm single.
- Ooh, I have brother.
You should hook up with him.
You should marry.
Immigration.
Lots of money.
- [laughing]
- Back to you in the studio,
Raja and Delta.
- From the desert to the sea
to wherever there's tea,
I'm Delta Work.
We hope the rest of your day
is a big ol' drag.
- Ladies, your newscasts
will be played for the judges
tomorrow night
on the main stage,
where we will be joined
by our guest judge,
Academy-Award-nominated actress,
from HBO's<i> Big Love,</i>
Chloe Sevigny.
[all gasp]
- I love Chloe.
Not only is she
an amazing actress,
but she's a fashion icon
at this point.
- So come decked out in your
most fabulous drag looks.
On behalf
of Debbie Matenopoulos,
I'm RuPaul,
and we'll see you tomorrow.
- Can I come in?
- No.
- We're back
in the workroom today,
and we have to put together
our fiercest drag look.
- How do you think our team did?
- I think our team is great.
I think we're not gonna
have a problem with that.
- I'm a little nervous.
I mean, if our news piece comes
out really shitty,
it's gonna be on me.
- I feel confident that we all,
on our team, did a good job.
- Change the subject.
I don't want to talk about this
anymore.
[laughter]
- India.
- What's up?
What went down on y'all's team
yesterday?
Everything went good
except for
the run-through with me
with the weather girl.
- Who else was on your team?
- Carmen.
- She's your team captain,
though, right?
Well, if you want to call it
that.
I'm just calling it like it is.
Carmen's only strategy was just
for her to pick her part.
I think she should be more like,
"Bitch, we need to win
this challenge.
Like, let's practice.
Let's get our roles down."
But you know, she just went on
about her business.
Bitch, I got stuck
with the weather girl.
Looking, trying
to read cue cards,
pushing this button,
trying to point at the map.
My performance yesterday
was horrible, you know.
I feel like I'm gonna be in
the bottom two again, honestly.
Like, I don't think
I stepped up my game,
and I'll see what happens.
Never again, bitch.
I'm not cut out
to be weather girl.
- For today's
runway presentation,
we actually have to bring
our most fabulous
drag-tastic outfits.
I need to get to my glue gun.
Ugh!
I have so much to do.
I do not want to be the one
lipsynching for my life.
Okay--Stacy.
- I actually overheard her
saying that I fucked it up.
- Do you think you did good
in this challenge?
- I think I did all right.
Let's be honest.
I fucked it up.
I did.
I'm very nervous that I'm
going to be in the bottom two
and have to lip-synch
for my life
and probably go home.
- My home girl, Miss Stacy.
Now, you know we're two
country girls.
But Alexis and I were both
engaged in pageant life,
and more so than pageants,
we're performers.
Would you ever compete
in a pageant, Raja?
- It's not my thing.
My name is Raja, so--
I can't do that.
I'm way too rock and roll.
- First thing
out of her mouth was,
"I don't do all that
'do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.'"
That's a stereotype.
- We don't smile
like Miss America.
Like, it's all about personality
and what you--who you are.
- The whole pageant thing
is really new to me.
We don't have that
in California.
- We do.
I'm the current California
Entertainer of the Year.
- Shangela is California
Miss EOY, honey,
and she is really passionate
about that.
She definitely let us all know.
- I've been in California
working it longer than you have.
- I adore Shangela,
but when I see
that little glimpse of,
like, entitlement, when you've
only been doing drag for...
minutes,
I don't think it's cool.
I think you have to be
an artist.
- It sounds to me
like you're saying
that people
who compete in pageants
aren't performance artists.
- Oh, stop it, Shangela.
I didn't say that.
- I'm listening.
- How is it your art form
if you're doing the art
under somebody else's rules?
- Thank you.
- You can defend her
'cause it's your best friend.
- I'm defending her
because she's right.
Shangela decided that
when you start talking
about a pageant,
you're attacking her.
- Girl, it's like
the<i> West Side Story.</i>
Bitches is like, "Ha, ha, ha!"
- It's not part of
our drag culture, though.
I think this is
a really new thing.
- Well, then y'all
defeated yourself already.
- No, I don't want to be
in a pageant.
No, but what if--
- Wait, time out.
Yeah, you're right, Raja.
- That's the performance
I wanted to do, what if--
- You're getting real
confrontational with me,
but I'm just saying other people
could do unique forms of art,
and they could also win.
- That was kind of heated.
- [laughing]
[upbeat music]
- Hi, gorgeous lady.
- Hey, guys.
Welcome to the main stage
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
Hey, Michelle.
How you doing?
- Good, gorgeous.
How are you?
- I'm doing wonderful.
It's gonna be a great show.
Makeup superstar Billy B
is here.
Hi, Billy.
- Hey, Ru.
- Debbie Matenopoulos.
- Hey, girl.
- Chloe Sevigny.
Hey, Scorpio sister.
- Hello.
- I'm feeling very Scorpio
tonight.
- Good.
I'm a double Scorpio.
So watch out.
[laughter]
- Now, for this week's
challenge,
our queens went live,
serving up morning newscast
realness.
Are you ready to take a little
time to enjoy this view?
Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best woman win.
First up, Delta Work.
[all gasp]
- Look out, Darryl Hannah.
She's makin' a splash.
- I think today
I'm just channeling,
like, Mae West or something.
Like, maybe it's like
Sally Kirkland,
like that, on the red carpet.
- We found Nemo.
- Yes!
Up next, Shangela.
Donatella would approve.
- As I'm coming down the runway,
I feel "wind" with me.
It's like that Beyoncé feel,
where everywhere you go
you've got wind.
- Sell the garment.
- Go 'head, go 'head, girl.
- Fly, butterfly.
Carmen Carrera.
What could she be reading about?
- I handmade that whole thing.
So I'm just hoping
nothing falls off.
There's no strap to my top,
so if that comes off,
then it's like you guys
are gonna see my titties.
- Who says the newspaper
industry is dead?
Mariah.
- She wore blue velvet.
- Feel like
I have a fabulous look.
It's clean, it's elegant.
- I love that gown.
- I'm getting Vanessa Williams
from this too.
- Oh, yes.
- Alexis Mateo.
Wow!
- Cha-cha.
- I'm just giving RuPaul
a lot of personality,
and being very cha-cha,
very Latina.
- Turn the--
- Charo!
- Go ahead, Charo.
- All we need is a trapeze.
- Ohh! Whoo!
Ooh.
- India Ferrah.
This is her more tasteful
sister.
I'm giving a little glamorous
India, you know?
Kind of old Hollywood.
I don't have my breastplate on,
because, you know,
I'm showing them
a versatile side of me.
- She's a lady.
- She's giving
a little bit of Ginger
from<i> Gilligan's island.</i>
- Stacy Layne Matthews.
all: Wow.
- It's very<i> Mad Max.</i>
- I'm in this lovely dress, and
the first thing I think about
is, "Smile, bitch."
They're really enjoying it,
because they haven't seen
this side of me before.
- I feel like she has
a puppy on her head.
- Is that a puppy on her head?
- Manila Luzon.
all: Ohh!
- Is that a bomb?
Everybody down!
- I'm just swaying my hips
and smiling
and showing off my purse
and having a gay old time.
- Did you, Tina Knowles,
a real pineapple?
- Honey, it's a T.K.O.
- You better work.
- Tina Knowles original.
- Yara Sofia!
- Oh, my goodness.
- Qu'est que c'est?
- Something wicked
this way comes.
- I'm bringing hairy horns,
the cape, and I take it off.
- [gasps]
Look at the body.
- She says, "Carmen Carrera,
you're not the only one."
- Yes.
- Hunty.
- Drive this.
Last but not least, Raja.
all: Ohh...
- It's fashion week.
- There's your Westwood,
right there.
- I'm really, really inspired
by things rococo
and Marie Antoinette.
All things sort of French.
- Let them eat cake!
- Anna Wintour will run that
in the spring issue.
- Gaultier,
remember who did that?
- We've got our cover.
- For sure.
- Yeah.
- Ladies,
I asked you to dazzle us,
and dazzle you did.
After this week's
main challenge,
morning television
will never be the same.
You hear that, Kathie Lee?
Earlier, the judges screened
your full live newscasts.
Now, ladies, I have
a little news for you.
Alexis Mateo,
you have immunity this week.
Raja, Yara Sofia,
Carmen Carrera, Delta Work.
You're all safe.
You may leave the stage.
- Thank you.
- Ladies, the five of you
represent the best and the worst
of this week.
It's time
for the judges' critiques.
Let's start with Manila.
- As over-the-top
as the performance was,
I really enjoyed it.
- Kristin Cavallari,
my brother, ho fun.
- I literally cried.
I mean, I thought that it was
brilliant on so many levels.
- Manila was a star tonight.
- Thank you.
- With that type of thing,
it cannot be half-assed.
And you went completely there,
did not break character.
It was fantastic.
But as far as the look goes,
it's absolutely flawless.
- It was so wrong...
that it was so right.
And truthfully, if you're
gonna be groundbreaking,
some eggs have gotta be broken
to make an omelet.
- If someone watching tonight
were offended by what you did,
how would you answer to that?
- I don't think we have enough
Asian people in pop culture.
So I'm here to entertain.
I'm here to be farcical.
And just trying to do my job.
- All right, next up, Shangela.
- The accessories
might have been
a little over-the-top
for my taste.
Maybe one of the bracelets
would have worked better.
- I think that it could be
a little bit less eye makeup.
- I loved this look tonight
for you.
I thought it was very pretty,
very sassy.
Not so much stuff lighting up
and lanterns
and this, that,
and the other thing.
You know, gossip on the radio
is my thing,
and you served it.
You did a great, great job.
- You could tomorrow
go to any local show
in this market in los Angeles
and say, "I wanna do your
entertainment news on a Friday;
take a shot on me,"
and I think they'd have
a hard time telling you no.
- What I saw in that broadcast
is what--the potential I saw
in your audition.
And I'm very proud of you, mama.
India Ferrah.
What was it like broadcasting
live as our weather girl?
- I had so much confusion
going on.
I didn't know where to go.
Cue cards were on the sides.
Like, I was lost, definitely.
- When India came out, I was
very impressed with her grace
and posture.
But the dress not so much.
- It was you reciting
what they told you to say.
And I think it did fall flat.
- What I wanted to see
was more of you.
- I wanna know what's keeping
you from bustin' out?
- Honestly, I don't know.
I don't know
if it's nervousness...
- I don't know what to tell you,
but the time to jump on it
is yesterday.
Next up,
the queen we call Mariah.
- I think she's stunning.
I mean, absolutely beautiful.
I think if I saw you, I'd think
you were a real woman.
I mean, you could give Naomi
a run for her money,
you know, on any catwalk.
- But Naomi would probably
throw a phone at her.
- I would catch it
and throw it back.
- Thank you.
- When the interviewing process
started,
I was getting
a little concerned,
and then it turned
for the better.
- So you're better known
for<i> The Hills.</i>
- Mm-hmm.
- But you're becoming
quite the man-eater.
- Mariah, you are what we call
a grower, not a shower.
When the interviewing process
started,
I was getting
a little concerned,
and then it turned
for the better.
But I thought
you looked stunning.
- I agree with
what Michelle said.
However, they don't give you
a second shot.
Three, two, one,
the camera's on--
it's sink or swim, right now,
'cause nobody cares--it's live.
- Stacy Layne Matthews.
- When she first came out,
I thought maybe she had a little
Yorkie on her head.
The hair was very confusing
to me.
- So, now, Chloe, are you saying
you're a Yorkie lover?
Is that what you're saying?
- I actually don't like animals.
[laughter]
- I love the way you look.
Know what I loved most of all?
Your smile, honey.
You lit up tonight.
- On the broadcast,
you did put a lot of thought
into it.
Almost too much.
You got so into
trying so hard
to memorize and memorize
that you forgot to be you.
- There seems to be something
blocking you
from completely blooming
in this competition.
- After thinking everything over
last night,
I feel like I lifted something
from myself.
And I'm ready to work.
I'm ready to show you
who Stacy is.
- Well, you said that last week,
Stacy.
Thank you, ladies.
While you untuck in the
Interior Illusions Lounge,
the judges and I
will deliberate.
Thank you, ladies.
You may leave the stage.
All right, just between us
gar-girls,
what do you think?
Let's start with Manila.
- The makeup to me
was a little heavy.
- Yes, the makeup was heavy,
but I don't know.
There's just something
about Manila tonight
that was a win-win situation
for me.
- I love Manila,
because I agree she's fearless,
and she's an equal opportunity
offender.
That doesn't mean you're racist.
You hate everybody,
including your own race.
Then it's funny.
- 'Cause if you can't
hate yourself,
how in the hell you gonna
hate anybody else?
- I say it all the time.
- All right, up next...
Shangela.
This is a tough one, 'cause she
did a really good job too.
- She impressed me, you know,
in all aspects.
And I think her personality
really showed through.
- I wasn't 100% sold
on the dress this evening,
but I loved the character.
She did a great job with it.
- Her personality
jumped through the television
and just tugged at your heart.
I just--I really--I wanted to go
have lunch with her.
- India Ferrah.
- It was hard to watch.
- It was hard to watch.
- Yeah. I feel for the girl,
but I wasn't impressed.
- She has the gift of us telling
her exactly what to do.
And she's still not doing it.
- Good point.
- I thought the dress
was horrible.
I thought the performance
was horrible.
I thought the makeup
was horrible.
This is $75,000
and a huge title.
- Yes, absolutely.
Mariah.
Listen, I gotta admit,
her performances do leave me
a little flat.
- She looked like
a professional journalist,
but acted like it was
a school project in ATL.
- Stacy Layne Matthews.
Every time she gets up here,
she's saying, "I'm gonna start
bein' me tomorrow!"
Chloe, do you believe her?
- Not if she keeps saying it.
- And she keeps saying it.
- Watching the newscaster,
I did not see anything
spectacular brought to it.
Did not see a character.
- Maybe that's her idea
of how bland newscasters are.
- It could be.
- And how boring a job
that would be.
Because she did look like a
woman walking at the mall.
- She looked like just a lady
on the number 110 bus uptown,
to me.
- The first thing I thought was,
"That looks like the newscaster
in Tupelo, Mississippi."
- It's true.
- All right, silence!
I've made my decision.
Bring back the girls.
- Welcome back, ladies.
Based on your live
morning newscast
and your presentation
on the main stage,
I've made some decisions.
Manila Luzon.
This week,
you broke all the rules.
You crossed the line
of good taste.
And you perpetuated stereotypes.
Congratulations,
you're the winner
of this challenge.
[applause]
Not only are you safe
from next week's elimination,
but you also win a $2,000
gift certificate from Wig USA.
- I'm really excited
that I won this challenge.
I'm proud of myself.
- Shangela,
keep up the good work.
You're safe.
- Thank you.
- India Ferrah...
as Khloe Kardashian once said,
"You can lead a horse to water,
but a pencil must be lead."
India, I'm sorry, but you are up
for elimination.
- I am disappointed that I'm
in the bottom two again.
But, you know,
I came here to do a job,
and that was to prove to
everyone that told me
that I couldn't do it
that I can do it.
- Mariah, listen to me, girl.
You are resting on pretty.
And while you rest,
the other girls are gonna
race right past you.
You're safe.
- [whispering]
Thank you.
Good luck.
- Stacy Layne Matthews.
Your brilliance
comes in flashes,
but those moments
are too few and far between.
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
- I do not want to go home.
There ain't shit
in North Carolina
but cornfields, honey.
Two queens stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me
and to save yourself...
from elimination.
The time has come
for you to lipsync...
for your life.
Good luck.
And don't fuck it up.
- I had this mentality,
you know,
just be fierce, be a bitch,
give attitude.
Give everything that they need
to keep me in this competition.
- I've worked so hard
to get here.
The only thing standing
between me and the finish line
is Stacy Layne Matthews,
and I've gotta
take this bitch down.
- Don't slap me.
- [laughing]
- 'Cause I'm not in the mood.
- [laughing]
[applause]
- Ladies...
that was a close one.
Stacy Layne Matthews.
Shantay, you stay.
- Thank you.
- India Ferrah,
your time at<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
has reached its climax.
But your legendary journey
has just begun.
Now...sashay...away.
- Thank you all.
- Thank you.
[applause]
- I'm definitely disappointed.
Apparently, I'm not
what the judges want.
I'm not comedy.
I'm not camp.
So I'm me, and I'm not gonna
change myself
to fit someone else's standards.
I can't reach it.
[grunting]
Yeah, anyway...
mwah!
- Condragulations, ladies.
I see a lot of incredible talent
on this stage.
But America's next
drag superstar
has yet to emerge.
Remember...
if you can't love yourself,
how in the hell
you gonna love somebody else?
Can I get a amen in here?
all: Amen.
- All right,
now let the music play!
- Yeah.
- RuPaul's menswear provided by
Moods of Norway.
Grand prize contributed in part
by AlandChuck.travel.


<i>- Previously on</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
RuPaul's Drag Race...
I want you to meet some real
athletes.
- Come on in, babies!
Come on in!
Whoo!
both: Divas, divas, here we go!
Safe sex is the way to go!
- Keep your pecker clean, man!
- Have a rubber catch
that semen!
both: Protection is the key!
both: No, no, no bareback.
both: Safe sex. Whoo!
<i>- Manila, you served up</i>
<i>two china dolls.</i>
Condragulations.
You are the winner of this
week's challenge.
- Yah!
- Ladies, I've made my decision.
Raja...
Shante, you stay.
- [sobs]
- Carmen Carrera,
baby, you don't make it easy
to say good-bye.
Now, sashay away.
[laughs]
<i>And tonight the dolls hit</i>
<i>the jackpot...</i>
- What?
- And go for broke.
It is time for the most
expensive challenge in<i> RuPaul's</i>
<i>Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> her-story.</i>
<i>With extra-special guest</i>
<i>judges La Toya Jackson</i>

- Top four again!
- Yoo-hoo!
- Déjà vu.
Carmen left the competition.
I love Carmen, but, darling,
at this point, it's you or me.
Oh, there's a message.
- Good-bye again.
Best of luck to everyone.
Turn it out and don't be
a sprepper.
- Don't be a sprepper.
Sprepper is this combination
of Sprite and Dr. Pepper.
It's sweet, but it's not
delicious.
- Raja, it's your turn.
- I've never done this before.
You guys have all done this
before I have.
Oh, BGB, girl.
Bye, girl, bye.
See ya later, Carmen.
I'll give ya a call.
I lost my cherry to being the
bottom two.
<i>- Finally, people.</i>
- Did you cry?
- I did a little bit.
I thought I was gonna go home
because of some guy that I'd
only known for two days.
<i>It was pretty close.</i>
<i>It was almost me.</i>
My only game plan at this point
is just to kick everyone's
asses, and I'm so close.
I am so close.
<i>[siren blares]</i>
<i>- Ooh, girl, you've got</i>
<i>she-mail.</i>
<i>Hey, big spenders.</i>
all: Hey!
<i>- I own everything.</i>
<i>[laughs]</i>
<i>Or at least I act like I do.</i>
<i>You gotta fake it till you</i>
<i>make it, honey.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
- Yes, ma'am.
<i>- Get that coin, girl.</i>
<i>'Cause if you don't,</i>
<i>there ain't nothing going on</i>
<i>but the rent.</i>
- What?
- What?
- Prostitution.
- Hello, hello, hello!
all: [cheer]
- My ladies.
all: [cheer]
- You know, most drag
performers make their money
in tips, but to be America's
next drag superstar, you need
to make your moola selling it
to the masses.
Now, for today's mini challenge,
you'll become host for the
newest, hottest home shopping
channel--RuVC.
all: [laugh]
- You'll each have three
minutes to pitch one product,
an item you choose from your
own drag, and the one queen
who convinces me to order
her product will win.
You've got 20 minutes to put
together a quick drag
spokesqueen look.
And I'll see you on RuVC.
All right.
- Oh, my god.
Ah!
- Everybody in the room
including me look a mess.
<i>Raja looks like Rainbow Brite.</i>
<i>Manila actually was pretty</i>
<i>with less makeup.</i>
<i>And Yara, I don't even have</i>
<i>a clue.</i>
- The first thing I thought of
was you're not my tucker.
It's fresh out of my own drag.
It's something that I rely on
most often,
and why not sell it?
- I don't know if I look good in
brown hair, but...
- What are you wearing?
- Welcome to RuVC.
I wanna tell you about a product
today that has aromatherapeutic
powers, healing powers,
it can feminize you,
it could increase your libido.
Be right back. My gaff.
You take this part that would
normally cover your genitals,
and you stretch it over your
face, and it has invigorating
powers that immediately wakes
you up.
That's $6,934, uh, 60 clams
from a tribe in Africa,
and 4 goats, and you, too,
can own this--Raja's gaff.
Start ordering, everyone.
- Hi, my name is Manila Luzon.
You may have seen me on such
shows as<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i>
or<i> Cops.</i>
I'm here to tell you about
this new product Man-ila.
You can use it for hair,
tabletop cleaner,
makeup finisher,
when you get these, like,
horrible runs in your nylons.
If you call right now,
we'll send you this free travel
cap that goes on top.
Thank you. Good-bye!
- Hi, America. I'm Yara Sofia.
It's kind of hard to find
the perfect hair.
And you can wear a perfect
pop-it-on.
See how gorgeous it is?
You can wear it like this,
and you can put it like this,
you can scrub yourself,
your body.
You know, we are drag queens.
You can use the pop-it-on
to clean your table.
Only 100 payments of $1.
You have to buy the pop-it-on.
Now, bye.
- My name is Alexis Mateo,
and I have a secret that I wanna
share with you--the hip pad.
If you always want the perfect
body but you cannot have it,
I got the magic solution
for you.
They are handmade
and hand-painted just by me.
For only two payments of $19.95.
But wait. If you call right now
in the last ten seconds,
I'm gonna give you handmade pads
for your ass Alexis.
The booty, the pads, everything
that you need to be a complete
drag queen for only two payments
of $19.95.
This is Alexis Mateo for RuVC.
- Hi.
all: Hi!
- Wow, wow. Ooh!
What do we have here?
Let's see what I ordered.
This is always so exciting.
- Yeah!
- Open it, open it, open it.
all: [cheer, applaud]
- It's a pop-it-on!
- A pop-it-on!
[laughs]
Say what, the pop-it-on!
Ah, she bought the pop-it-on!
Finally I--I win the mini
challenge.
- Yara, your prize for winning
the mini challenge is...
$1 million.
- What?
Gee! Whoo!
- Well, well, actually,
darling, it's 1 million Ru
dollars.
- Oh!
- Yes.
- What happened?
- Now, the pit crew was up
all night cooking up this dough
at Cat Print.
While these may not pay your
bills, they could come in handy
a little later, because it is
time for the most expensive
challenge in<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i>
her-story!
This week we are throwing
a make-dat-money ball,
and each of you will have to
come up with a portfolio
of three different looks
that you could take to the bank,
honey.
First category--Swimsuit Body
Beautiful.
You need to create a bathing
suit hot enough to attract
a billionaire.
Second category--
Cocktail Attire After 5:00.
You need to create a flirty,
short dress where all that
glitters is gold.
Third category--Evening Gown
Eleganza.
- Work.
- Using 2 1/2 million Ru paper
dollars,
you need to create a dress that
literally screams money.
Yara, because you won the mini
challenge,
you have an extra million
dollars to play with.
Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best woman win.
- We have three challenges
in a row that have multiple
looks for the runway.
Like, are you exhausted?
'Cause I'm exhausted.
- I feel like I'm a glamorous
sweatshop worker, if you will.
- That's just 'cause you're
Asian.
- [laughs]
- [sighs] Have you ever made a
swimsuit before?
- No, I haven't--
I've never made one.
- What're you gonna do
for a swimsuit?
- A gold swimsuit.
All I hear from the judges
all the time is that my body's
not right, that my walk is not
right, that my hair is not
right.
<i>I cannot please all the judges,</i>
<i>but that doesn't define</i>
<i>who I am.</i>
I mean, there's nothing wrong
with my body at all.
Probably something wrong with
Michelle's and Santino's body,
but it's not--nothing wrong
with my body.
I'm just the girl that wears
the pads and the titties
in the show.
- Alexis mentions her
insecurity coming in,
and it's all in her head,
I think.
- But they're not, like,
sleeping on you, Alexis.
Like, they love you.
You have a great personality.
- It's just bullshit.
I don't know.
It doesn't make any sense to me.
- Why are you saying that
the judges are against you?
You have win three challenges,
girl.
- Now because of that,
I'm gonna get all fucked up.
- Fuck glue gun.
- Did you burn yourself?
- Fuck, fuck.
- Today's main challenge
is to make three distinct
money looks--uh, a swimsuit,
a cocktail dress, and an evening
gown--for Ru's make-dat-money
ball.
- Where's the only
fucking glue gun?
- We're stressed out, 'cause
it's gonna be a long day, honey.
- Some craziness.
<i>I know there's a lot of people</i>
<i>that think that I'm gonna do</i>
<i>wrong in this challenge.</i>
I don't have a clue
how this is gonna turn out.
I have never worked with this
kind of material, and every time
I try hard, I get shit.
- Girl! That--oh, maybe you
wanna start over.
- Um, I hate it.
I think we're all in a great
panic at this point.
There's very, very little time,
and I can feel the stress
in the room.
Oh, I hate starting over.
I can't stand this anymore.
- Hello, hello, hello!
-<i> Hola!</i>
- Are you ready for the
make-dat-money ball?
- Yes.
- Not yet.
- Hi, Alexis.
- Hi, Ru!
- Does this challenge frighten
you at all?
- Yeah, I am worried about it.
Like, it's so difficult.
I'm not a pro.
I'm not a designer.
- Okay, all right.
So, are you gonna do a whole
gold storyline here?
- You know what, Ru,
I have no clue what I want
to show on the stage.
<i>I'm talking to Ru,</i>
<i>and it was not going well.</i>
That scares me a lot.
- Who's your biggest
competition?
- It is Yara.
Yara have everything that I love
in a drag queen.
Her mind is very high-fashion,
and her personality is so,
so big.
Plus she's Puerto Rican.
- Uh-huh.
- So, if I don't win this
competition, another
Puerto Rican should be crowned.
- [laughs]
All right, get back to work.
- Thank you, Ru!
- All right.
Yara Sofia.
- Hi!
- Tell me about money.
Are you free-spending,
or are you very frugal?
- I'm very free-spending.
- [laughs]
- I'm broke, but I'm still
fabulous.
- If you win the $75,000,
are you just gonna spend it?
- I am gonna move probably
to the states.
Puerto Rico, it's hard to find a
job.
- It's hard to find a job here
too.
- Yes, I know, but it--
in Puerto Rico, it's more hard.
- Do you make a living
making dresses?
- Yes. My inspiration
is Bob Mackie.
- You could be the next
Bob Mackie.
We need another Bob Mackie.
We need more wearable art.
- Mm-hmm.
I want to risk the American
dream.
I want to make my own line
of clothes.
And that's why I'm here, I'm--
because I love drag,
I love to make dresses.
This is my life.
- Ooh!
Look how delicious.
All this money.
You've been in the competition
for a long time.
Are you surprised that you've
lasted so long?
- Well, no, I knew that, like,
I was gonna be in for the long
haul.
I just didn't know you were
gonna bring all these girls and
have all these extra challenges.
- So, is it safe to say you
didn't come to the competition
to make friends, you came
to win?
- Uh, well, both.
I love meeting new people,
so I'm gonna make a lot of
friends, but if I have to stab
them in the back, I mean,
whatever.
- [laughs]
Well, hello, Raja.
- Hi, sexy lady.
- What are you working on now?
- Well, I'm basically making
an armature for a top hat made
out of coins and cash.
- Oh, wow.
Do you have enough time
to do something like that?
- I think so.
- All right. Now, tell me
something about the swimsuit.
- I wanna show my skinny body
and do just a bikini.
- How do you stay so skinny?
- I work out. I do Pilates and
yoga.
And with my, uh, $75,000 that
I win, I'll finally get
my gastric bypass.
both: [laugh]
- All right, ladies,
gather around.
All right, there's one more
thing that will make this week's
main challenge even richer.
<i>- Ah, no!</i>
- I want you to choreograph
a group number that will kick
off the make-dat-money ball.
<i>- On top of all this?</i>
Oh, my god, I'm gonna die.
- Now, Yara, since you won
the mini challenge,
you're in charge.
Oh, and you'll be shaking
your moneymakers to the song
<i>Just Wanna Dance</i>
by Miss La Toya Jackson,
because tomorrow on the main
stage, back again at my personal
request, we'll be joined by
Miss La Toya herself.
all: Yay.
- And our extra-special guest
judge will be<i> the New York Times</i>
best-selling author
Gigi Levangie Grazer.
- Cool. Yay.
- All right, ladies,
time is money, so get to work.
And, remember, don't fuck it up.
- Oh, my god!
- You have to measure your--
your size, and you have to make
the mannequin for you,
'cause it will take your shape.
- Alexis, is your fit gonna be
immaculate?
- You know what, I'm looking
like the way I want it to look.
If they like it, they like it.
If they don't like it, oh, well.
<i>I'm completely freaking out</i>
<i>right now.</i>
<i>I was feeling stressed out,</i>
<i>and I cannot do the challenge,</i>
<i>and it's horrible.</i>
You get to a point when you
cannot control your feelings
anymore.
<i>I just want this to be over.</i>
I just wanna go home.
- When I see Alexis packing,
what the fuck are you doing?
What are you doing?
both: [speaking Spanish]
- I am tired, I'm exhausted,
and to see Alexis packing,
it makes me feel angry.
- What's going on with, um,
Alexis?
- She's trying to give up.
I don't know.
- She's over it?
- She's trying to leave
the competition.
<i>- Alexis gave up and left this</i>
<i>competition.</i>
It's a very, very dark moment.
- I don't know where--
where is she? Where is she?
- I don't know.
I have had, like, meltdowns
and freak-outs, and I'm trying
to hold myself together, because
at any moment, it could happen.
Like, the pressure is so intense
right now.
- She told me, like, she gained
weight, and sometimes it's so
hard to make clothes for her.
- We have no time.
- No time!
- We have to do three outfits.
- It's frustrating for me,
'cause I don't want to be
uncomfortable.
- Anyway, well, guess I'm
gonna start putting shit
on my dress.
[sewing machine whirs]
I decided to, like, whip out
Sahara's picture because
it's like seeing my boyfriend is
a really great reminder
of why I'm here.
- Girl, what's going on with
that picture?
- Oh, It's Sahara Davenport.
The most beautiful drag queen
after RuPaul.
- Do you miss her?
- Fuck yeah, I miss the bitch.
- Cute.
- You know, I think I've tried
sewing a dress before,
with a slit in the side, and it
didn't work out.
So I don't know why I'm trying
this again.
Bitch man is not the tea.
- [sighs]
Stress, stress, stress.
[door squeaks open]
- [exhales]
-<i> Ay!</i>
You're scaring me.
You're a psycho bitch.
- It was just--I don't know.
I decided to stay in this
competition all the way
till the end.
<i>I'm here, bitches. I am here.</i>
I didn't came here to just
give up in the top four.
I came here to be America's
next drag superstar.
- Drama, girl.
- [chuckles]
- So, girls,
let's get--dance, girl!
It's time to go to rehearsal.
- Just 'cause RuPaul put you
in charge doesn't mean you have
to yell at us.
- I decide to split the
choreography between Alexis
and me, 'cause we have a great
connection and Alexis is
a good dancer.
- Here we go.
- Whoo! The coins!
- Get your coins, girl.
- Um, let's begin.
- What are we gonna do?
- Manila seems a little bit
terrified,
but so am I, so we're in this
together.
- First step.
Step with the right...
Shoulder, out.
Boom, bam.
Five, six, seven, eight, we do
this in line.
And we get out of the line.
We go back in line,
and we gonna repeat that again.
- Perfect.
- Whoo! Okay.
- Good job, darling.
Outsides all yours.
I told you, she's good.
- Here we go! And step.
Again, we got it, we got it, we
got it.
- I'm lost, I'm so lost.
Oh, what happened?
Oh, wait, what am I doing?
- Wait a minute.
[laughs]
- Wait, sorry.
What am I doing? Am I following
you?
I'm doing the opposite of you
now, right?
- [laughs]
- I'm still doing that?
I haven't done a choreographed
routine in such a long time.
I'm terrified.
- It's easy.
- Once I get this, you guys
better watch out.
- Okay.
- Oh, girl, you're gonna have to
catch up,
because it's not that difficult
to understand, so get it
together, bitch.
Hands up.
Then we going to the left,
to the right,
and go all the way to your ass.
Shakin' my ass.
- Yeah, darling!
- Shake your ass.
- Yeah!
- Manila, Manila, just shake
your back.
- [laughs]
- Yeah, we just shake the ass.
- How are you doing that?
- I'm moving, I'm moving.
- I don't know how to do this.
- The cha-cha is inside all of
you.
Hey, I want to do this.
It's like...
We supposed to be touching each
other's back.
- Oh, hey, girls.
- Five, six, seven, eight.
Boom!
Don't leave the back.
Don't leave the back.
No, no, what are you doing,
Manila?
- Again.
- Can we do this?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Can we just not put it in
front of our faces?
'Cause I don't want to block
this mug.
- Hey, hey, watch out!
- [exclaims in Spanish]
- I'm not really a dancer,
and so picking up choreography
is like not the easiest thing
for me to do.
<i>We're down to the final four.</i>
<i>I don't want to fuck this up,</i>
<i>so...</i>
Awesome, guys.
Go team.
- This is gonna be a mess.
- [laughs]
[alarm beeps]
- Money morning!
- Money, money, money,
money, money, money.
- Oh, my god.
Feel like I should've just had a
bed here.
- I know. Like, what was the
point of even going back home?
- We haven't sleep or nothing.
- There's a lot of pressure,
and it's really important for me
to do a great job on this
challenge, because it's one of
our last challenges.
And if I don't do a good job,
I'm gonna be in the bottom two
again.
[sighs] All right.
- You guys, did we use every
single glue stick there is?
- Yes.
- Yes, we did. See?
- Did you use the extra
million dollars?
- Yes, except for--
- Everything?
- Except for this one.
- Wow.
- 'Cause I wanted a big one.
- That's a lot of dress, honey.
<i>- Yara's is way too</i>
<i>complicated.</i>
<i>And I understand avant-garde,</i>
<i>but it's just really crazy.</i>
If she were to sit down in it,
it would look like a pile of
garbage.
Yara, it's like a tropical
garden.
It's really huge.
- I don't care if
the other girls will like it.
I'm focused on my stuff.
RuPaul is gonna love it.
- Who's top three?
- I would like to be me,
Yara, and Alexis.
- Manila, you think it's gonna
be easier for you to win
the competition if Raja's gone?
- If it all goes correctly,
then I should be in the top
three.
- If you don't make the top
three,
the decision is incorrect.
- Sure.
I put so much energy into this
competition from day one,
and I feel like I really worked
my hands to the bone,
and I need to be in the top
three.
It's just so close.
- The top three gonna be me,
Raja, and Yara.
- Never, never, never
in a million years.
Where's Manila going?
- Home. After tonight.
- Hey.
- I deserve it.
I want Alexis in the top three.
And the other one, I don't know.
- Since Manila and I had a--
had a pretty close relationship
throughout this competition,
I would like to see her there.
- I deserve it, motherfuckers.
I'm gonna make the top three,
because I worked very hard
for this, and I'm gonna let them
have it!
<i>[laughter]</i>
<i>- And what?</i>
Hey, guys!
Welcome to the main stage
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
Hey, Michelle, you like?
- I love.
- Mike Ruiz, you look like
a million dollars.
- Oh, so do you.
- Well, you know, as Dolly
says, "it takes a lot of money
to look this cheap."
- [laughs]
- Gigi Levangie Grazer,
how does a Hollywood wife make
her money?
- Well, we earn it the
old-fashioned way, RuPaul--
through divorce.
- [laughs]
- L.A. Toya, you're back by my
request.
- And I will do anything for
you, Ru, you know that.
- Oh, honey, that's big money,
La Toya, if you ask me.
both: [laugh]
- This week our queens
were challenged to create
three million-dollar looks
for the make-dat-money ball.
To kick things off,
they're gonna make it rain
to La Toya Jackson's
<i>Just Wanna Dance.</i>
Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best woman win.

after 5:00.
Yara Sofia.
- She's the merry widow,
ready for her next husband.
- Yes.
- It's like she's getting ready
for Liberace's funeral.
- Uh-huh.
<i>- My cocktail dress is inspired</i>
<i>by Nina Ricci, like,</i>
<i>very Evita Peron,</i>
<i>very sophisticated, very dark.</i>
- And I love the gloves on her.
- It's very film noir.
- The widow wore gold.
Up next, Alexis Mateo.
- Ooh!
-<i> Goldfinger.</i>
- Ooh!
<i>- With my cocktail dress,</i>
<i>I think about myself.</i>
<i>Alexis always cha-cha.</i>
<i>That's what the dress is.</i>
<i>I'm not gonna change myself</i>
<i>for nobody else.</i>
<i>I'm just gonna walk the dress,</i>
<i>and I know it looks sickening</i>
<i>on me.</i>
- The Golden Globes.
- It's like two canned hams
under a blanket, fighting it
out.
- Really, yes. Ooh, I love ham.
Manila.
- Hey, girl, hey!
- All right!
- Lots of attitude.
This reminds me of a disco.
<i>- Well, I don't know about Ru,</i>
<i>but I take my disco nap</i>
<i>at 5:00 P.M., so this is going</i>
<i>to be an after-5:00-A.M. Look,</i>
<i>yes, and, honey, I am still</i>
<i>partying, and I'm about to go</i>
<i>to the after-party, honey.</i>
- New year's eve 1984.
- Oh, my god.
'80s in the San Fernando Valley.
- For the love of money.
Up next, Raja.
Ooh, Raja and the gold rush.
<i>- The look for my cocktail</i>
<i>dress is a little bit heiress,</i>
<i>and it's a little eccentric.</i>
- I own everything, and I
bought it on my American Express
Gold card, darling.
Category is million-dollar
Evening Gown Eleganza.
Yara Sofia.
- She blew her cash wad.
- Yes.
It's Marie Antoinette.
- Cha-ching.
<i>- I'm doing my runway,</i>
<i>and I feel like a queen,</i>
<i>and it feels so great.</i>
<i>I feel so powerful.</i>
<i>The avant-garde for me</i>
<i>is everything.</i>
- She's got the credit cards
in there too.
- Her whole safety deposit box.
- Suze Orman called.
She wants her Fico score back.
- [laughs]
- Up next, Alexis Mateo.
- Goddess of the sea.
- Yes. Yes, like scales.
- They're like fish scales.
<i>- I wanted to look like a</i>
<i>mermaid.</i>
<i>I wanted to look like tropical,</i>
<i>flowers, colors.</i>
<i>I wanted to look very pageant</i>
<i>as well.</i>
- It's like the Little Mermaid
meets Lil' Kim.
- Yes, it is!
Mo' money, mo' problems.
You can bet your bottom dollar,
and I do mean bottom.
Manila.
- Imelda markup.
- Imelda markup, that's right.
- It's better than a markdown.
<i>- For my evening gown made of</i>
<i>money, the judges are really</i>
<i>liking my look.</i>
<i>I think my hair is just so big</i>
<i>that they have to love it.</i>
<i>I mean, come on, who doesn't</i>
<i>love a drag queen with gigantic</i>
<i>hair?</i>
- She looks like a Texas
tycoon's wife.
- Yes!
Black gold.
both: Texas tea!
- [laughs]
- I think her economy
just double-dipped.
Up next, Raja.
- Wow.
- Ow!
<i>- Ultimately I had this idea</i>
<i>of this 1930s sort of starlet,</i>
<i>and she is going on a train</i>
<i>to the Hearst castle to meet up</i>
<i>with all of her fancy buddies,</i>
<i>and I think it looks fantastic.</i>
<i>I think I look like an exotic</i>
<i>bird.</i>
- She owns the world.
- If I had the dollars...
- Very Linda Evangelista.
- All the honeys making money.
Welcome, ladies.
It's time for the judges'
critiques.
Yara Sofia.
- Yes?
- Penny for your thoughts.
- [chuckles]
This is my inspiration,
from Alexander McQueen.
- Yes.
- And the hair is my trademark.
My pop-it-ons.
- Your pop-it-ons.
- But this time covered
in money.
- Yara, you are absolutely
gorgeous.
- Thank you.
- I do think that it's
a bit busy.
All the gold necklace and then
the gold going into the bustier,
with the hair and the necklace,
it's almost like that.
- Your cocktail dress
presentation was a little
morose, and I would've hoped
that you would've been a little
more effervescent, you know,
on every level.
- Up next, Alexis Mateo.
- I love what you've done
to this dress.
This is why I know you could've
done something much better
with the bathing suit than
what I saw.
- And it's pretty much the same
for your cocktail dress.
I think it was just a little
too simple for me.
- When you came out in
the bathing suit, I thought,
I'm so glad she got rid of Ike.
- [laughs]
- That Tina Turner wig was
fabulous. I loved it.
- The problem with the swimsuit
for me was that it was too
<i>abuelita.</i>
It was too grandma.
And because it was cut low,
it made you look bulky.
- All right, up next, Manila.
- Hi, judges.
- Now, tell us about this dress.
It looks like Beverly Hills
shrubbery.
- You know, at the end of
the night when you open your
drag bag to see all your tips...
- Yes.
- They're all crumpled
and sweaty, and so I thought
that it would be kind of
interesting to, like, tear up
money and crumple them,
and then, um, glue them on here.
- When I look at the pink
flower in your hair,
it's absolutely gorgeous.
It enhances your color tones.
I did feel and think your hair
was a little bit too big.
- How dare you!
all: [laugh]
- I'm a drag queen!
both: [laugh]
- Well, I loved your swimsuit
presentation.
It was very Saint-Tropez,
French Riviera.
It was very Samantha Jones,
you know, goes to the Hamptons.
I loved it.
- It all worked.
It was thought out, and it was
executed beautifully.
- The cocktail attire,
very Mahogany, very Diana Ross.
I wanna go to that cocktail
party.
- All right, up next, Raja.
- Hi.
- When you walk out,
you act as if you own the stage,
and I wanna focus on you,
because you give me, you demand
that attention from me.
And that's what I love about
you.
But your after-5:00 to me
was so plain.
It was so simple.
It was so ordinary.
The entire outfit, to be quite
frank with you, reminded me of
a Pointer sister.
- All right, ladies,
here's the $75,000 question--
why do you deserve to be crowned
America's next drag superstar?
Let's start with Yara.
- I'm so broke.
all: [laugh]
- Uh, I don't have anything in
my bank.
My credit card is over--
is overdrawn, and I need money
to--to move to the states,
and I would like to live
the American dream.
I have charisma, uniqueness,
nerve, and talent.
I have everything.
I'm the full package.
- All right, Alexis,
same question.
- I think I deserve to be
America's next drag superstar
because inside of me, like every
American and every real person,
I am not perfect, but I have
the desire to continue.
And if I can move forward
in the competition and become
America's next drag superstar,
I would do it with honor,
respect, and proud.
- Manila, why do you deserve
to be crowned America's next
drag superstar?
- I came to this competition
blessed.
I feel like I represent
the product of a loving
and supportive family.
I'm not a Cinderella story.
My parents didn't kick me out.
My parents have been very loving
and very supportive.
And I have a beautiful family.
And I think that I carry
a message of--to love and be
really supportive of--of all
your friends and your family,
because we all have, like,
the power inside of us.
We just need that extra push,
and I'm here to--
to speak that.
- Raja, same question.
- In winning this competition,
I would love to leave a legacy
for all those little boys...
[sighs]
All the little boys who are
teased, who are afraid,
who don't know how to express
themselves creatively yet,
you know, and they don't even
know that they're allowed to go
against the grain.
It's okay to say fuck you,
and do what you love to do,
and express yourself thoroughly.
I wanna be an example of someone
who is proud, someone who is
accomplished, and someone who
loves--loves what they do.
- The power of Fuck You.
all: [laugh]
- Well, girls, I think we've
heard enough.
Now, while you go and untuck
in the interior illusions
lounge, the judges and I
will deliberate.
All right, just between us
gargoyles, what do ya think?
Let's start with Yara Sofia.
- To me, it looked like she got
run over by a Brink's truck.
- It was a miss.
It was too much.
- Her speech, I'm sorry,
but I felt for her.
- You're a softie.
- Oh, my god, this poor thing.
She doesn't have any money.
- I really felt for her,
but, you know, I don't think
we can pick a drag superstar
based on the fact that we feel
sorry for them.
- Right. All right,
let's move on to Alexis.
- She's not utilizing her body
the way she should and could.
Just the bathing suit alone.
- It was like a middle-aged
woman trying to get laid
at Jones beach.
- If you're gonna pick a
proportion like an hourglass
in that dress, why are you gonna
pull all of your hair back
into this teeny-tiny--
she looked like Beetlejuice.
both: [laugh]
- All right, let's move on
to Manila.
- The swimsuit was beautiful.
It was feminine. It was elegant.
Totally nailed the challenge as
far as that goes.
- She has incredible stage
presence.
She's always on when she's up
here.
She's the queen of that coy
kind of thing, and you have to
take that into consideration...
- Sure.
- When these people have your
name attached to them as
America's next drag superstar.
- Let's move on to Raja.
Now, I've just gotta start with
that gown...
- Crazy good.
- Which was just breathtaking.
- Two words about the cocktail
dress, Ru.
- Mm-hmm.
- Oil can.
- [laughs]
- I'm probably gonna lose it
again, but listening to Raja's
speech, I was one of those
little boys.
I was one of those little boys
who wanted a beacon of hope,
who wanted somebody to look up
to, to say, "you know what,
it's gonna be okay.
Be yourself, and be creative,
and be inspired, and think
outside of the box, and don't
let anyone ever tell you
that you can't."
You know, so, to me, I don't
even care what Raja was wearing
tonight.
- [claps]
Silence!
I've made my decision.
Bring back my girls.
Welcome back, ladies.
Now, based on your performance
in the make-dat-money ball,
I've made some decisions.
Manila, this week you looked
like a high roller,
but did you hit the jackpot?
Raja, your Evening Gown Eleganza
was top dollar, but were you
outspent on the runway?
Manila, condragulations,
you are the winner of this
week's challenge.
- Oh, my god.
<i>- You will receive a collection</i>
<i>of fine jewelry from</i>
<i>Kathy Ireland Jewelry.</i>
- Thank you, guys.
I won, I won!
Two weeks in a row, bitches.
- Raja...
You're safe.
Alexis Mateo, Yara Sofia,
I'm sorry, my dears,
but you are up for elimination.
<i>- For me, being in the bottom</i>
<i>two is like losing.</i>
I feel horrible.
- Two queens stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me and save yourself
from elimination.
The time has come for you
to lip-synch for your life.
<i>- Yara is my sister,</i>
<i>and I know what the competition</i>
<i>means to Yara.</i>
She wants this so bad,
but I want it too.
- Good luck
and don't fuck it up.
<i>- I cannot even think.</i>
<i>I cannot perform.</i>
<i>I have to lip-synch to convince</i>
<i>the judges that I'm good.</i>
<i>I don't know if I can.</i>
<i>- I'm crying because there's</i>
<i>a lot of emotions.</i>
<i>I was thinking too much.</i>
<i>I'm so angry,</i>
<i>and I'm so disappointed.</i>
<i>I'm a mess.</i>
- [sniffles]
- All right, ladies,
I have made my decision.
- [sniffles]
[sobs]
- Yara...
[speaks Spanish]
- Alexis Mateo,
Shante, you stay.
- I told you.
Don't worry about it.
- [speaking indistinctly]
[sobs]
I'm so sorry.
- Don't be sorry.
It's emotional.
We've all been there.
- [sobs]
- Yara Sofia, listen to me.
The sparkle you have,
the sparkle you brought to
this competition, no one can
wash off.
It's there, it's yours.
You are a star.
Remember this--
<i>Echa, echa, echa pa'lante.</i>
Now, sashay away.
- [kisses]
<i>The lip-synch was so awful</i>
<i>for me, 'cause I didn't expect</i>
<i>to be in the bottom two,</i>
<i>but it's not my decision.</i>
And this is for Puerto Rico.
So, I'm gonna<i> echa pa'lante,</i>
darling.
I'm fine. I'm--I'm so happy.
Um, I did my best, and this is
me.
I don't know.
I have too much to offer.
- All right, ladies.
You're the top three.
Let me tell you something.
Everyone on this panel can
attest that show business
is a tough business.
It can be very painful,
but we go on.
If you cannot love yourself...
Say it with me.
How in the hell...
- How in the hell...
- You gonna love somebody else?
- You gonna love somebody else?
- Does that make sense?
- Yes.
- Amen.
- All right.
Now, let the music play.
Let's celebrate.

-<i> Previously on RuPaul's</i>
<i>Drag Race...</i>
Snatch game!
- Yay!
- Okay.
- Hi, how are you?
- Ooh, ooh!
- Naomi Campbell is
a cum-guzzling whore!
- Hold up.
- Yeah, baby.
- Mm-hmm.
- Stacy.
- Condragulations.
You are the winner
of this challenge.
- To see Stacy win,
and I'm in the bottom two?
W.T.F.?
- Delta Work.
Shantay, you stay.
This is the emancipation
of Mariah.
Now sashay away.
<i>And tonight...</i>
It's time to bare your souls.
<i>The queens have their cake...</i>
- Aw, thanks.
-<i> And eat it too.</i>
- I took a bite of it
and I swallowed.
- Oh, dear.
<i>With extra special</i>
<i>guest judges,</i>
<i>Sara Rue and Eliza Dushku.</i>
<i>The winner of RuPaul's Drag</i>
<i>Race</i>
<i>will receive a lifetime supply</i>
<i>of Kryolan professional makeup,</i>
<i>headline Logo's Drag Race tour,</i>
<i>featuring cocktails perfected</i>
<i>by Absolut,</i>
<i>and a cash prize of $75,000.</i>
And may the best woman win!
- Morning.
- We're walking
into the workroom today.
And the whole entire room
is empty.
And at this point,
we're eight left,
and I need to step up my game.
- There's a message.
Aww.
- Cheers to Mariah.
- Mariah!
- Mug for days.
- Mug for days.
- I'm gonna erase it.
- The more people leave,
the happier I'll be.
It's just less noise in my ear.
I'm just an old granny,
and I just can't handle all
the yip-yap, chitter-chatter.
- So are you excited you won?
- I am.
Pulled that shit out
at the last minute, girl.
- I actually, like,
wasn't expecting it.
I don't know if Stacy's amazing
job last week was a fluke.
She's like the underdog that
people aren't paying
attention to.
- I'm proud of myself because,
you know, I had doubted myself
a few days ago.
There's people
in this competition
who feel like I'm not talented.
But I feel confident now.
So, you know, fuck these
other bitches, honey.
I feel like I'm gonna win
this shit.
- Heather.
- Heather wants to talk to us.
- Come hither, Heather.
- Heather, what are you making?
- I'm making my skirt, Heather.
Carmen, Manila, Delta and myself
have decided to call each
other "Heather."
Because we formed this clique
which looks a lot
like the movie<i> Heathers.</i>
- We're basically
the pretty girls,
the top four.
And then there's
the other girls.
- Ooh, she left--
what did she leave?
Earrings, these are cute.
- We take a lot of pride
in what we do.
And, um, I think that's where
we find a common ground.
So, so be it.
We're Heathers.
[laughter]
[siren wails]
-<i> Ooh, girl!</i>
<i>You've got shemail.</i>
<i>Hey, ladies.</i>
all: Hey.
-<i> I've got a little secret</i>
<i>I want to share with you.</i>
<i>I like cake.</i>
- Ooh!
- Oh!
-<i> Big, German chocolate cake.</i>
- Ooh.
-<i> If I could, I'd have a hot</i>
<i>cake in my mouth</i>
<i>first thing every morning.</i>
- Me too.
-<i> If you love cock the way</i>
<i>I do, just be careful.</i>
<i>Don't bite off more</i>
<i>than you can chew.</i>
all: Oh, my God.
- I don't want
to eat anything crazy.
- It's cake.
- Oh, it's not cock?
- [laughing]
- Hello, hello, hello.
all: Hi!
- My girls.
Now, a drag superstar needs
to be able to serve womana,
even when she's stripped of her
wigs and padding and things
of that nature.
Now, I posed undraped
for a photograph in my book,
<i>Working It.</i>
And I did it without
compromising my Christianity.
I found the experience
so liberating,
I wanted to share it with you.
- Thank you.
- Now, for today's
mini-challenge,
you'll be posing for a tasteful,
intimate, feminine portrait.
And you'll be doing it
in the nude.
- Oh!
- Ooh!
- My heart just drops.
You know, I don't even like
to have sex naked.
- Now, in a moment you'll meet
celebrity photographer
Deborah Anderson,
who's renowned for
her artful nude portraits.
You have ten minutes to prepare.
You may use light makeup,
then it's time
to bare your souls.
Bye.
Let the games begin.
- Are you fucking serious?
My fat ass has got to take off
these clothes?
Y'all bitches is crazy.
- Oh, Jesus, take the wheel.
I just really don't want
to do this.
I have been single for a reason,
and now America is going
to find out why.
- Where is my bathrobe?
Oh, shit.
-<i> Hi, Stacy.</i>
<i>This is Deborah.</i>
- I have a piece of fabric
that you can use a little.
There's no pressure;
you do whatever feels
most comfortable to you.
- Let's get naked.
-<i> Serving womana.</i>
- All of a sudden I had
this spiritual awakening
that happened to me.
And I fell into it.
- Ooh, fabulous, fabulous.
Let's discuss the socks.
- Oh, right.
Gotta have these off.
- [laughing]
There you go, perfect.
Beautiful.
- You cannot knock the modeling
powers of Raja.
Put me in front of a camera,
and I will pose you down.
- Beautiful, right there.
There you go, there you go.
Beautiful.
Careful now,
not too much backside.
-<i> Too much ass.</i>
- I can't see anything.
- Yeah.
I wonder if you straighten
that top leg.
- There you go, there you go.
There.
- Yes.
Yes, ma'am.
A work of art.
- Bring that leg up, bring
that--beautiful, right there.
<i>Gorgeous.</i>
<i>Beautiful.</i>
<i>Fabulous.</i>
That body?
You kidding me?
Keep moving that face,
my darling.
It's like we've got
the same face in every frame.
I want choice, darling.
- Okay, I can do that.
- Otherwise, we're stuck
with one picture.
<i>Love.</i>
<i>Just watch where your light is.</i>
- You feel like you're
a little tentative here.
- It's horrible, the feeling
is just horrible.
I just want it to be over.
- Alexis, Alexis.
Look at me.
You're not there.
All I see is your nervousness.
Focus, focus.
Give me drama, okay?
We want the confidence,
we want the beauty.
And find that light.
-<i> Ooh, loving that.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
<i>Loving, loving.</i>
Hi, Delta.
- Hi, how are you?
I'm so scared.
All I can think is
that this lady's
gonna freakin' laugh at me.
Deborah, nice to meet you.
- Oh, the joy.
I get a kiss, I love that.
- But I realize, this is it.
If I want to be the next drag
superstar, I have to do it
at all costs.
- If you indeed want to use it.
- I want to use every yard
of it.
[both laughing]
- Yeah, feel that light.
- There we go, there we go.
Beautiful.
Yes, loving that.
Loving that.
-<i> Gorgeous.</i>
<i>A new dawn for Delta.</i>
- And darling, we are done.
- Oh, cool.
- Awesome.
- [laughing]
- My biggest fear was met today.
I met it head-on.
I felt so liberated.
I would love to do it again.
- We won't be able to get you
to put clothes on anymore.
- No, I don't think so.
Carmen Carrera better watch out.
- [laughing]
Ladies, all I can say is
you give good flesh.
But one of your nude portraits
stood head and shoulders
above the rest.
Carmen Carrera.
-<i> Thank you.</i>
[applause]
Yay, I won.
Piece of cake.
- Now that we've all gagged on
Carmen's cheesecake photo,
I hope you've left room
for dessert.
For this week's main challenge,
each of you will be designing a
couture designer dress inspired
by one of these mouth-watering
cakes.
There's angel food,
red velvet, pineapple upside
down, chocolate lava,
cheesecake, princess cake,
carrot cake,
and my favorite,
strawberry shortcake.
[giggles]
Now, Carmen.
Because you won
the mini-challenge,
you will assign each queen
a cake.
I'm gonna start off
with this cheesecake.
- Aw.
- Thank you.
Carmen's gonna give me the one
with the boring colors.
I knew exactly
what she was doing.
- We'll go with
the pineapple upside down.
- One of my favorites.
- Mm...
We'll give it to Shangela.
- Aw, thanks.
Would you be happy with
a pineapple upside down cake?
- Who's got some shortcakes
here?
Yara.
- Whoo-hoo!
- Red velvet.
Mmm.
Stacy.
- My favorite.
- Angel food cake is next.
For the cool kids, I want to
make sure that they're taken
care of.
Delta Work.
- Aw.
- Carrot cake, Manila.
- Oh, yay!
- Chocolate lava,
that leaves one person.
- Thank you.
- And that leaves the princess
cake for the princess herself.
- Princess cake is the prettiest
one, so it's mine.
- Now to create
your perfect face, face,
face of cakes outfit,
you can use materials provided
by Michael Levine fabrics.
Your couture confection should
look good enough to eat.
Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best woman win.
See you later.
-<i> Whoo!</i>
<i>Got a cake, got a cake.</i>
<i>Got a cake, cake, cake.</i>
- I kind of need to be inspired
by my cake.
I need to taste it first.
Mm.
I'm getting an idea.
There's nothing I love more
than chocolate.
I could drip it
all over my naked,
lithe body over and over again
and just lick it off myself.
- Is anyone nervous?
Shangela?
- Evil bitch.
- Ha.
- The sewing challenges
in this competition
continue to be my downfall.
- When you put this together,
they create these barriers.
- Oh!
But what about the bottom?
- The fabric is not enough.
- Oh, no.
- No, this is the front.
This is just the front.
And where's the back?
You know what I mean?
- Right.
Now the question is, am I going
to fall in the hole,
or am I going to be able
to jump over that hole?
- So, Shangela,
what are you making?
- A dress.
Today's challenge is that we
have to create a high-fashion
couture outfit,
based on the type of cake
that we were assigned.
There are tons of girls left in
this competition that sew.
And here I am, still over there
trying to get the one-two
stitch down.
- Cuteness.
Heather, can you help me?
- Yes, Heather.
- I think it's hilarious we're
calling each other Heather now.
- Well, I mean, aren't we?
Those are our names.
- Like, didn't they all kill
each other?
- Well, yeah.
Only one Heather stands.
Right, Manila?
- Hello, my sweets.
all: Hi, Ru!
- Can I borrow a cup of sugar?
- Sure, darling.
- How you doing?
- I'm good, how are you?
- This cake is almost all gone.
- Well, not really.
It's just a few slices.
Part of the description
of this competition
was to do cake couture.
- Mm-hmm.
- You understand
what couture is?
- Yeah, pretty much.
- Pretty much.
- Yeah.
- One-of-a-kind,
special details.
- Honestly, I'm not a
high-fashion kind of drag queen.
So I think that's one of the
biggest obstacles I have
to overcome.
- All right,
I want to see fashion.
So I will see you
on the main stage.
- All right. Thanks, Ru.
- All right.
Hey, Manila.
- Hi.
- So tell me about
your carrot cake couture dress.
- I'm kind of drawing from
Givenchy meets Jessica Rabbit
meets<i> Playboy</i><span style="bodyStyle"> bunny.</i>
- Oh, that's a lot of ideas
going on there.
Are you sure you can incorporate
all of this?
- Well, I'm gonna try.
- Okay.
I can't wait to see it.
- Thank you.
- I'll see you later.
- Hey, Alexis.
- Hi, Ru.
- Now, of course this outfit
looks like cheesecake.
- I'm going for it.
- You're gonna go for it.
- That's the idea.
- Now, how are you gonna make
this more high-fashion couture?
- I will work with the style
of it.
It's not going to be
evening-gown Cinderella.
It's just gonna be
a high-fashion model.
- All right, kiddo.
I'm gonna let you get back
to work.
- Yes, thank you for visiting
me, Ru.
- All right, kiddo.
Yara Sofia.
- Yes.
- You're doing the strawberry
shortcake.
- Yes.
- Now, you sew for a living.
- I love to sew, I love it.
I'm gonna give the judges
a couture high-fashion dress,
but well-done.
I'm a strong, wicked bitch.
- All right, kiddo.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Raja.
- Hi, Ru.
- Chocolate lava cake.
- Hold me, Ru.
- [laughing]
- I took a bite of it,
and I swallowed.
- Oh, dear.
Oh, my goodness.
- I swallowed it.
I'm a terrible model.
- But you had to bite it to get
your inspiration, right?
- Sure, sure.
- I've always been really
obsessed with different, like,
historical silhouettes.
So I just happened to have
these, like, French peignoirs,
and I was, like, maybe I can
kind of play with that with,
like, a little bit of an exotic,
Indian, spicy kind of thing.
- All right, get back to work.
- Okay, see you later.
- All right.
Delta Work.
- Hi, Ru.
- Angel food cake.
- Yes.
- Are you a fan?
- I am.
Of all the cakes
that you could go get,
it's the lowest in fat.
So I can eat the most of it.
- [laughing]
- I think I need to bring
something youthful.
- Yeah.
- And I think I need
to bring something fresh.
Because the characters that I've
been doing have always been
older than who I am.
- Right.
I think it's about making
something that's contemporary.
I know that that's what
the judges are looking for.
- I like that.
- Yeah.
I look forward to seeing
some fresh cake on the runway.
- I'm excited.
- All right, go for it.
- Thank you.
- Hey, Carmen.
- Hey, hey.
- Why did you choose
a princess cake?
- 'Cause I was just drawn
to the color.
- This is, like,
green and pink and white.
- But you're going
with just the pink here.
It's the Barbie interpretation
of a princess, isn't it?
- When I hear Barbie from Ru,
I'm like, "This is wrong."
I'm not trying
to be princess Barbie.
- Well, listen, I'm gonna let
you get back to creating
your Jersey couture.
- My Jersey couture, yes.
- Good luck.
- Thanks.
- All right.
Hey, Miss Shangela.
- Hi, Ru.
- How you doing?
- [deep breath]
I'm okay.
- On season two,
you had problems sewing.
- Yes.
- And it's what ultimately
got you eliminated.
How's it going this time?
- I don't know.
You know--
- You're nervous.
- I am.
- Has anyone offered to help you
out at all?
No?
Do you feel like the other girls
are not supporting you?
- I know this is a competition,
and everyone's out
for themselves.
- But you have helped
other girls.
Do you expect them to help you?
- I would--I would like that.
- Well, I think it starts
with you asking.
- What?
Seriously?
Like, Ru has been asking,
"Has anyone helped you today?"
And, bitch, she's made
the other girls her puppets.
- It's sometimes hard for me
to ask for help.
- Well--
- But I will, I will.
- Get in there
and make this happen.
Okay?
- Okay.
- All right.
Gather around, ladies.
Every time I watch one of those
cake decorating shows,
I say to myself,
"My queens could do a better job
in their sleep."
So in addition to finishing
your cake couture dresses,
you need to turn a real cake
into the ultimate edible
accessory.
- We have no time to make
these fucking dresses,
and now we gotta make a cake.
I don't want to see no more
motherfucking cake!
- Starting with a naked cake
and a look-alike doll,
the icing on the cake will be
your charisma, uniqueness,
nerve, and talent.
The end result should look
a little something like this.
You'll be debuting your
cake-stravaganza ensemble
tomorrow on the main stage.
And our guest judges will be two
sweet and stylish actresses.
The ever popular Sara Rue.
- Oh, my gosh!
- Ooh!
- And Eliza Dushku.
all: Ooh!
- Ladies, good luck.
And don't fuck it up.
All right,
I'll see you tomorrow.
all: Bye, Ru.
- Oh!
- I need to figure out
how the frick
I'm gonna decorate a cake.
- Now I got a cake to do too?
- I feel sick.
- This is gonna be a challenge
that we're gonna remember.
We have to not only create an
outfit for the runway look,
we have to create a cake that
represents who we are.
I don't even cook nothing
at home.
- Here we have our guest chef
from North Carolina.
What are you doing, girl?
- Uh, first I'm gonna ice
this motherfucker.
- Oh, really?
Ooh.
- You got to whip it good.
- Whippin' it, whippin' it,
whippin' it.
- No, no, whippin' is like this.
- No, no, no.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
I'm the chef.
- [laughing]
- Ew, that's not me.
That's some booger.
Who the fuck is that?
Yara's is beautiful.
- Yes, Yara, yours is hot.
Bitch, they retouched hers.
- Word of advice, do not leave
your cakes out in the rain.
- [laughing]
- Look at my Native American
[indistinct].
- What tribe are you from?
I don't really know.
- Lumbee Indian.
This is the traditional pinecone
circle.
- What's on the arm?
- Fancied-out shawl.
Being the only Native American
in this competition,
I thought it would be different,
you know,
not just to decorate the cake
in my own style,
but, you know,
to represent my heritage.
- I offered Shangela to help her
with her garment,
because, for me,
it's nice to see
that somebody actually takes
advice and trusts you.
Because in a competition
like this one,
it does tell me a lot
about Shangela.
It amazes me how you trust me.
- Yeah.
- When you know I don't know
what the hell I'm doing.
- Oh, that's great.
That makes me feel real good
right about now.
Oh, I go on the outside
of your stitch?
- Even if you're going on top
of it, it doesn't matter.
You're just going to reinforce.
- It's okay,
I'm just reinforcing it.
Okay, cool.
Ooh.
Oh, crazy.
Oh, come on.
Work with mama, work with mama.
- Shangela gets the most
of her help from Alexis.
She gets makeup help,
now she's getting sewing help.
And if Alexis would have left
last challenge,
then maybe Shangela would have
just been sitting there,
confused.
- This machine,
this bitch's name is Bertha.
Work, Bertha!
Oh, fuck.
- Ugh, annoying.
- Now you know.
- Hey, Raja.
What does your family think
about you getting in drag
and stuff?
- Oh, they like it.
They know that I enjoy doing it.
So...
- That's all that matters, huh?
- Yeah, that's it.
What about you?
- My mom was, like,
really cool about it.
- And what about your dad,
where's he at?
- My father passed away
when I was two, in the '80s.
- Oh, babe.
- I met his family, like,
a year ago.
- Really?
- I didn't know them.
I didn't have any type
of relationship with them.
But, yeah,
it's just really weird.
Like, I'm trying to, like, find
out little by little as much
as I can about him.
Growing up, I had my mom,
I had my grandmother.
And it was enough for me.
But I always wondered, how would
my personality have changed,
having my father in my life?
But I'm very happy
for who I am now.
- What was the reaction,like,
when you met your dad's family?
- I wasn't going to keep it from
them that I was gay.
They kind of gagged
a little bit.
So after that shocker,
I was like,
"Oh, and I do drag
on top of that."
- Oh, awesome.
- And then they gagged again.
And after that,
everything's cool.
- Manila,<i> ven aqui.</i>
- Yes, mama.
How can I help you?
- When you won your challenge,
did you feel a little bit of
extra pressure after winning?
- Oh, for sure.
No, they're looking at you
even harder.
- Judging, and--
- 'Cause you were, like, you
were the best of the best.
And, like,
once you're at the top...
- Mm-hmm.
- The only way to go is down.
So, like, you have to prove it
to everyone.
And be, like, I'm gonna be
on the top again.
- I'm just trying to figure out
couture,
'cause I don't wear couture.
I don't know.
I felt very confident
at the beginning.
You know, Ru comes over.
And I went from maybe
a nine to, like, a three
in, like, ten minutes.
So I don't know
what to do anymore.
I mean, what do I do?
- What is this?
They're, like, strawberries?
- No, I don't know what the fuck
that was, girl.
I just designed it.
It doesn't even look couture.
- Huh?
- How would it look in here?
- Uh, like a football player.
- I don't know;
it was just an idea.
- I mean, I like
the asymmetrical look of it.
Yeah, do, like, one side.
Make it asymmetrical.
That's always more couture.
But I ain't gonna tell you how
to design your damn thing.
- [laughing]
- 'Cause, honey,
I'm gonna win this one.
Check.
- Okay.
[alarm clock ringing]
- Oh, my God.
- Ooh la la!
- Look at the mess.
- Look at this mess.
- Cake time.
- We're back in the workroom
this morning.
We have to decorate the cake.
And we have to finish our
costumes for today's runway.
- So this morning, I'm looking
at my sequined dress.
And I'm, like,
"Listen, these judges are gonna
read me down."
This dress isn't my style
of cake.
- Hey, Carmen.
- What are you doing?
What do you think
about the dress?
Tell me.
- About my dress?
- Yes.
- I found some really nice green
fabric today, thank God.
And I just whipped something up
real quick.
- Oh, so you sew.
- Well, I guess I do now.
- Yeah!
[laughing]
- Let me do your braid.
Oh, here you have...
It's pretty?
- Yeah, it's pretty.
Maybe, can we start it higher?
- Yes, it could be.
- Yara was helping Shangela
style her wig.
Yet again, help.
She needs a lot of help.
- She's like fucking doing
her hair.
- I know.
- It just really upsets me.
I'm representing myself here,
not the work of other people.
- Bless her helpless
little heart.
- For today's main challenge,
we actually have to design
a high-fashion cake look.
And we actually have
to decorate a cake.
- Oh, I've always wanted to put
safety pins on a child's cake.
- Oh, well.
Hallelu.
Can I make a suggestion,
just an artistic one?
- Yeah, most definitely.
- Just bring the corn up higher.
Right now it looks like corn
straight out of the can.
- Is that a read?
I didn't say anything about
that graffiti mess
that she had going on
on her cake.
- Ooh, work.
- But I decided
to take her advice
and add a couple more kernels.
Hallelu.
- What a beautiful corn
you've made.
- Yeah.
- Shangela.
- I need iridescent.
- Yara, do you think it's cute?
It looks like a cheesecake.
- Ooh, Alexis' costume.
She might be in trouble.
I mean, there's nothing more
unflattering
than to, you know, strap
a blanket around your waist.
- I'm freaking out.
I still have a lot
of finishing touches
on my runway look.
I really don't know how
I'm gonna finish this cake
and finish my outfit
before the runway time.
- Raja.
- What--
Oh!
- Is there any way to get
a little bit more height here?
- Let me see, Stacy.
- Not with these.
- [laughing]
I was about to say.
- It looks like comfy couture.
Stacy's couture,
runway worthy outfit,
inspired by tights.
Hmm... bold move.
- I have the colors,
I have the white shoes.
I have capris.
I feel like it's couture.
[laughter]
- Hello!
- Hey!
- Welcome to the main stage
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
Michelle Visage.
- RuPaul!
- Billy B.
Why, you old geezer.
- I'm hungry.
- Sara Rue.
- Hello.
- Love the name.
- Ooh, yeah.
I love yours.
- Eliza Dushku.
- That's right.
- Welcome to my dollhouse.
- I'm Susie stalker fan
right now.
I love you, Ru.
- Security.
- [laughing]
- This week,
we challenged our queens
to create cake-inspired
couture dresses
and then to decorate a doll cake
that expresses
their true drag persona.
Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best woman win.
Yara Sofia, serving
strawberry shortcake.
- Look at those stems.
- Uh-huh.
- Ooh.
-<i> I'm bringing a Puerto Rican</i>
<i>strawberry shortcake.</i>
- Now, I see her berries.
But where's her twig?
- It's hiding in the vine.
- Serving carrot cake, Manila.
Ooh, as a blonde.
- What up, doc?
- Where's she hiding
that carrot?
-<i> I have my Madonna Louis</i>
<i>Vuitton rabbit ears.</i>
<i>I got my cute little</i>
<i>Samantha Jones belt on.</i>
<i>And I'm just going to pump down</i>
<i>that runway</i>
<i>like a starving model.</i>
- Trix are not for kids
with this one.
- Mm.
- That's right.
Alexis Mateo,
serving cheesecake.
- She's a high-end cheesecake.
-<i> I'm going down the runway,</i>
<i>and I'm feeling high-fashion.</i>
<i>I just want to serve drama</i>
<i>at this point.</i>
- Designer cheesecake.
- A little bit
Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond.
- [laughing]
- That's there, too.
Princess cake,
from Carmen Carrera.
- Of course.
- Of course.
-<i> I'm serving something</i>
<i>really different:</i>
<i>a different hairstyle.</i>
<i>I have the shaved side thing,</i>
<i>that, like, Cassie, and other</i>
<i>celebrities are doing.</i>
- Paris Hilton.
- Paris Hilton, that's right.
- Heatherette.
- Yes.
- Yes.
- Oh, here's one hot piece
of cake.
- Mm-hmm.
- Red velvet cake.
From Stacy Layne Bryant Matthews
Lattisaw.
-<i> I have my puffiness going on.</i>
<i>I have my white</i>
<i>and my red velvet.</i>
<i>I know I look delicious, honey.</i>
- This would make me get
off my diet.
- Shangela,
pineapple upside down cake.
- It's like Barbra Streisand
meets pineapple cake
with a touch of Rapunzel.
-<i> I'm serving "pineapple upside</i>
<i>down keep turnin' me" cake.</i>
<i>I'm serving cake</i>
<i>on my shoulder,</i>
<i>and I'm definitely serving</i>
<i>cakes in the rear.</i>
- She's all pretty
with a cherry on top.
- Always gotta have the cherry.
It's the first thing to go.
- Yes, it is.
Delta Work,
angel food cake!
- [gasps] Look, it's the teen
angel food cake.
- It is teen angel.
-<i> I hit the stage today, and</i>
<i>I think it's undeniable that</i>
<i>I'm doing angel food cake.</i>
<i>I feel confident.</i>
<i>I know that there's no way</i>
<i>that I can land in the bottom.</i>
- Heaven must be missing
an angel food cake.
- Uh-huh.
Peggy Lee stole it.
- That is Raja,
serving chocolate lava cake.
-<i> I step out onto the runway,</i>
<i>and I am completely aware that</i>
<i>there's a possibility</i>
<i>of my undergarment showing.</i>
<i>But the rest of it</i>
<i>is pretty awesome.</i>
<i>And so what if a little bit</i>
<i>is showing underneath.</i>
- It's bubbling lava, honey.
You need a 12-step program
to deal with that lava.
- And a glass of milk.
- Ooh!
- Welcome, ladies.
It's time
for the judges' critique.
Yara Sofia.
Tell us about your doll cake.
- This is mini-me.
She's wearing a national costume
with the Puerto Rican flag.
-<i> Echa pa'lante!</i>
- Yes!
- Now let's hear
from our judges.
- Did you have a run-in with
the police this morning?
Because someone beat the hell
out of your face.
- Thank you, thank you.
- I love the dress.
I knew instantly you were
strawberry shortcake.
- When you're wearing white,
wearing a darker undergarment
might not be the best.
Just 'cause it pulled me out
of the fantasy.
- Sara, a little inside
information.
There's a lot more than
a dark underwear going on
underneath there.
- [laughing]
- Let's move on to Stacy Layne
Bryant Matthews Lattisaw Q.
- As everybody knows,
I'm Native American.
I actually decorated
in a traditional regalia
for a female.
- You definitely pulled off
the red velvet.
And it made me hungry.
- Would you like to taste?
- You and I have this thing.
You know I do.
- [laughing]
- It's too simple.
- All of the interest
is up here.
It sort of looks like you had
a skid and have a strawberry
and then some glitter got in it.
- The outfit's not couture
in my eyes.
- All right.
Up next, it's Manila.
- This is little baby Manila,
and she took a little trip down
to Chinatown,
and she got a whole buttload
of fake designer purses
shoved up underneath this dress.
- When you first came out,
the belt, I loved it.
And then I hated it.
And then I loved it.
- Yeah, and you know.
Loving something and hating
something
at the same time
is very couture.
I mean, you've got
a lot going on.
- Yeah.
- Right, right.
- Your makeup here looks like
that you had an accident with
the flour when you
were making the cake.
- Next up, Alexis Mateo.
Now tell me
about your doll cake.
- It screams Latina.
It screams passionate.
This doll is actually who I am.
Just in a cake.
- One thing that I think
about the skirt.
It's not particularly
flattering.
You have to admit.
I mean, there are bedspreads
made out of that.
- We girls are trying
to maintain a figure.
And, to me, that adds
unnecessary bulk.
- What is the material that you
used to wrap around your hair?
- It's just fabric.
- I feel like if you're gonna do
that,
like, really show that fabric
and make it precise,
so that it's really sleek.
- Is it plain?
Yes, but maybe that's how you
wanted to represent yourself.
- Up next, Raja.
- I wanted it to feel really
edgy and very straight
and punk and fun.
Sort of like me.
- You reminded me how much
I love chocolate.
For sure.
- Your makeup went a little bit
more spooky
than I think you meant for it.
It's too Goth, I think.
- I wanted to yell out when you
were walking, like,
"Oh, no, honey!
We see your white bloomers."
- I know.
- Now, Sara.
- Yes, Ru.
- Would you put that cake
in your mouth?
- No, I would rub it
all over my body.
- [laughing]
- I think that cake's amazing.
- All right.
Carmen Carrera.
- Thinking about my cake,
I just wanted to put a lot
of that, like, queen,
like, pageant girl,
that I have in me.
I just wanted it to be pretty
and sparkly.
- And you're very diamond
princess, like Trina.
And how'd you go from turning
your dress from pink to green?
- When me and you had spoke,
the minute you mentioned Barbie,
I was like, "I don't want to be
Barbie princess on the runway."
- The dress and the belt, and
I think your hair and all of
that--I'm not sure how it
becomes a princess,
except maybe the princess
of New Jersey.
- Being a Jersey girl,
I'm very proud to say
that you look
like the princess of New Jersey.
But here's the thing.
You're way sexier
than that doll.
You should have done her sexier.
- Can we just talk
about from the neck up?
This sort of, like, mohawk off
to the side
with those jewels,
it's gorgeous.
- Next up, Delta Work.
- I really like
what I'm wearing.
I thought I would sort of do
an inspiration of that
in, like, a little ball gown.
So I made sure that I had,
like, pearls.
And then there's rosettes on
here that mimic the rosettes
that are at the bottom--
- Oh, yes.
- Trim of, um, here.
- Delta, I loved
your look tonight.
I think it's glorious.
- Thank you so much.
- And your cake is on fire.
- It reminds me of that scene
in<i> Grease,</i>
where she's a beauty-school
dropout.
- Oh, yes!
- Frenchie.
- It just, like--yeah!
I just think it's great.
It made me happy
when you walked out.
I was, like, "Oh!"
- Up next, Shangela.
- The doll cake
is very Shangela.
Of course, corn has always
haunted me and I've embraced it.
As you can see,
the Shangela has a hand up.
She's saying hallelu.
- The dress, it's cute.
It didn't totally blow me away.
But I mean,
it makes sense for your cake.
- With the makeup, something
is freaking me out today.
You're much friendlier
and prettier of a person
than the way you're painted.
- All right, this is my question
for you, Shangela.
- Yes.
- All these queens
that I see in front of me,
I can tell that being a queen
is their life.
I question that about you.
Is being a drag queen
what you really want to do?
- Yes.
You know, some people have 20
years doing drag,
and I only have
a little over one.
- Understood.
- But I'm here
because I want to be here.
And I'm here because I want
to be the Next Drag Superstar.
100%.
- Okay.
- Shangela, one last question.
- Yes.
- Who do you think should go
home tonight?
- Carmen Carrera.
- Clearly I have to disagree
with Shangela.
I mean, I think that my outfit
is a little bit more
high-fashion than hers.
- I'll present the
same question to Stacy.
- Carmen.
There's high-fashion looks here,
but just don't feel
like she executed that.
- Same question.
Delta Work.
- Stacy.
You know, I think maybe Stacy
thinks, like,
sometimes, "Well, I'm big, so
there should be
some accommodation made."
And I don't allow
any accommodation for myself.
- Manila, I want a serious
answer from you.
- I would like to see
Shangela go.
She's just a loudmouth,
and she's always talking
and hallelu-ing.
- Raja.
- Stacy and Shangela,
get the fuck out.
- Tell me why.
- Oh, Stacy.
I--you know, I'm not sure
if she's ready.
And Shangela, although
your personality shines,
I think you should be
on season five or six.
That's where you should be.
- That's interesting, Ru,
because Raja's been in the game
for 20-plus years doing drag,
and I've been only for one.
And we're in the same
competition here.
- Well, girls.
I think we've heard enough.
While you go and untuck in
the Interior Illusions Lounge,
the judges and I
will deliberate.
You may leave the stage.
Just between us girls.
Let's start with Yara Sofia.
The dress.
Would you wear that dress?
- No.
- She was supposed to recreate
a couture creation
of her cake that she was given,
which is a strawberry shortcake.
And I thought
that was interpreted
and executed flawlessly.
- She keeps building
in this competition
in ways that we really
didn't anticipate.
- She's the dark horse.
- The pro is her personality.
- Her cake was hysterical.
- It was.
Here, I'm gonna take a little
taste of her cake right now.
- Mm.
- Good?
- It's moist.
Stacy Layne Bryant Matthews
Lattisaw Q.
- I am a sucker
for people's backstory.
And I think the fact
that she's from Swampville.
- Back Swamp, yeah.
- I don't want to fall in love
with somebody's backstory.
I want to fall in love with
what's on the stage.
- The reality of it tonight
is that she looked awful.
- Manila.
Now, Manila's dress
I thought was fantastic.
I wasn't crazy
about all the accessories.
- It was just kind of strange
and cartoony in a way.
- I was so obsessed with
that gray, cadaver makeup.
- I loved Manila.
I would have worn that dress.
Again, yes, I would have taken
off the carrot belt.
- Yeah.
- But, you know,
we all would've.
- Next up, Alexis Mateo.
I understand the silhouette.
I know what she was going for.
But the execution of it
wasn't fierce.
- The skirt looked like
the polyester bedspreads.
- Motel 6.
If you put a black light on it,
you'd run.
- Let's talk about Raja.
I was surprised about the
pantaloon storyline, you know.
- It happens.
I've been on red carpets.
And sometimes, you know,
you just--it happens.
I just think she is not to be
played with, and I like her.
- Now, Sara, do you think
that her Depends...
- Yeah?
- Cost her the top spot?
- It didn't bother me,
'cause it was such a--
it was so clearly, like,
"Whoops," you know,
she made a mistake.
- The reason why I said that the
makeup went a little bit spooky
is because I couldn't find
anything wrong with her.
Her cake was a piece of art.
- Carmen Carrera.
- Like, if we could pick
"from the neck up winner,"
she would be my winner.
- When somebody gets their
16-year-old a car at Christmas,
that's the bow that goes
on the top.
- Her face looked pretty.
Her hair looked pretty.
I loved the little tiara
that was on her head.
But was it lower-level
than the other ones?
Yes.
- Delta Work.
- She looked amazing
when she rounded the corner.
And then, as she stood there,
I saw more and more wrong
with the outfit.
- I thought, quite honestly,
she looked gorgeous tonight.
- Miss Shangela.
- If you still don't know how
to beat your face,
which is a huge part
of being a drag superstar,
then you're not ready.
- The other ones live
to be drag queens.
She stands out as one who does
not live to be a drag queen.
- It seemed to me tonight,
that there was, like, a lot
of raw talent there.
She just didn't quite know
what to do
'cause she doesn't quite have
the training.
- Well, then,
she shouldn't be here.
- Right.
- Silence!
I've made my decision.
Bring back my girls.
Welcome back, ladies.
Based on your face of cakes
presentation on the main stage,
I've made some decisions.
Yara Sofia.
Your strawberry shortcake
was sweet as pie.
<i>Echa pa'lante.</i>
You're safe.
- Thank you.
- Delta Work.
Your angel cake couture had
one too many layers.
But the overall effect
was heavenly.
You're safe.
- Thank you.
- Stacy Layne Matthews.
Your red velvet cake
was hard to swallow
and not couture.
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
- It just pisses me off
that a lot of these bitches
look like shit.
But, you know, I wanted to do
something different.
Everybody's wearing
fucking dresses.
I should have made a dress
and called it a day
and been the fiercest bitch
onstage.
- Manila.
You doll cake was moist.
And I want another piece.
You're safe.
- Thank you.
- Raja.
Even though you flashed
your knickers,
the judges couldn't stop
gushing over
your chocolate lava couture.
Condragulations.
You're the winner
of this challenge.
You've won a glamorous
shopping spree
at the legendary house
of L.A. Eyeworks.
- Thank you so much.
This is my second time winning
a challenge.
And I think I deserved it.
Because I have a master's degree
in fierce.
I should be a professor.
- Carmen Carrera.
Your Jersey princess cake
couture did not hit the spot.
Alexis Mateo.
You're a sweet talker,
but your cheesecake couture
struck a sour note
with the judges.
Shangela.
You and a sewing machine
are a recipe for disaster.
Shangela, you're safe.
Is there anything you'd like
to say?
- I'm here
because I want to be here.
And I appreciate
what you see in me.
And I'm gonna continue
to show you
that not only
am I an entertainer,
but I am a drag queen.
And I'm meant to be here.
- Carmen Carrera.
Bada-bing, you're safe.
- Thank you, guys.
- Alexis Mateo.
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
- I consider Stacy my friend
in this competition.
But if you give me the choice
between me and her leaving,
of course I'm gonna choose her.
- Two queens stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me
and save yourself
from elimination.
The time has come for you
to lip-synch for your life.
Good luck, and don't fuck it up.
-<i> I didn't know what the judges</i>
<i>wanted to see.</i>
<i>I went to the high-energy road.</i>
<i>'Cause that's who I am.</i>
-<i> I'm not that great</i>
<i>of a dancer.</i>
<i>But this is a competition.</i>
<i>I do have a name, a reputation.</i>
<i>And I'm not just gonna stand</i>
<i>there</i>
<i>and just give up in a song.</i>
- Now, I'm no stranger to being
bald on the runway,
but Stacy is taking out track
by track by track.
It looks like a poodle just shed
all over the runway.
[applause]
- [laughing]
Ladies.
I've made my decision.
Alexis Mateo.
Shantay, you stay.
Stacy Layne Matthews.
You've come a long way
from Back Swamp.
But from this moment on,
the world is watching.
Be proud, be a star.
But most of all, be a lady.
Now sashay away.
Thank you.
[applause]
- Love you.
- Stacy.
- I never thought that,
coming from a small town
in North Carolina,
that I would even be
in a place like this.
So, you know, it's amazing.
I'm just glad to have made it
this far.
I'm very proud of myself.
I'm happy with what I've done
and what I brought
to the competition.
Condragulations, ladies.
And remember,
if you can't love yourself,
how in the hell you gonna love
somebody else?
Can I get an amen up in here?
all: Amen!
- All right.
Let the music play!

- Previously
on<i> RuPaul's drag race...</i>
Escandalo!
- Oh!
- Kristin, what's next?
- Manila Luzon,
you've perpetuated stereotypes.
Condragulations, you're the
winner of this challenge.
- I'm ready to show you
who Stacy is.
- Well, you said that
last week.
Stacy Layne Matthews.
Shantay, you stay.
And tonight...
Oh, my goodness!
The competition heats up.
- Word.
- And the dolls get shady.
- I hate her!
I hate her!
- With extra special
guest judges
Aisha Tyler and Amber Rose.
The winner of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i>
will receive a lifetime supply
of Kryolan professional makeup;
headline Logo's<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> tour,</i>
featuring cocktails perfected
by Absolut;
and a cash prize of $75,000.
And may the best woman win!
[tires screech]
- Oh, my goodness.
- [laughs]
- "Never give up.
You're all stars."
- I am so glad I am not the one
that went home.
Bye, girl.
- Stacy, put your back into it.
- Girl...
- [laughing]
- When I was on stage
for the elimination,
I was so mad at myself.
Girl, I felt like I was about to
walk the plank, honey.
- Yeah.
- It does.
- You know how Shangela said
you feel like you about to die?
- Yeah.
- Girl...
I feel like I could be doing
a whole lot better
in this competition.
I just feel like stuff keeps
coming back
and just knocking me down.
- God, Manila won
the challenge.
- Yeah.
- How sad is that?
- I thought she did
really good.
- You don't think it was, like,
a little bit risky
that she was making fun of
some--
- She was making fun
of a culture
that she looks to be a part of,
but she's not.
You know, it just made me
uncomfortable,
but the judges seemed
to enjoy that.
So hallelu.
- Girls, it's just like
Margaret Cho.
That's what I was going for.
You know, she makes fun of her
Asian mom all the time.
- But she is of that culture.
That's her mom.
- It's really no different than
you doing black, Southern lady.
- Well, but I'm black,
and I'm from the South.
- She is not acting.
She is.
- I think that the whole
conversation is bullshit.
If a black girl was asked to be
funny,
the first thing they
immediately do is get ghetto,
get country, and I love it.
What's the difference, really?
- Some of us were doing it
as drag queens.
- Well, no, I think
that everybody on that set was
doing drag.
It was just a different
interpretation.
- It's your interpretation
of it.
- Yeah.
No reason to get mad.
- I just don't want to talk
about it.
- What's going on?
- They're just making it all,
like, a race thing,
and it's not.
- It's so not.
I don't mean this to be
offensive,
but do you have nail polish?
- [laughing]
- No, I'm serious.
[siren wails]
- Ooh, girl!
You've got shemail!
Hey, hey, racers.
all: Hey!
- In the cosmos, there are
billions and billions of stars.
But the brightest ones are
right here in Hollywood.
Now, when it's your turn
in the spotlight,
will you sparkle, Neely,
sparkle...
or will you fall deep into
the Valley of the Dulls?
[laughing]
- [giggles]
She's so good.
- Hello, hello, hello!
all: Hey!
- Hi, ladies. Wow.
For today's mini challenge,
we're gonna play
the new gaming sensation
that's sweeping the nation,
and it's called...
Shit RuPaul Says.
- Okay.
- Say it with me.
all: Shit RuPaul Says.
- [laughing]
One by one, letters will pop
onto the screen.
Now, if you think you know
the answer, hit your buzzer.
But be careful, because if
you're wrong, you're out.
The last queen standing will win
a phone call home.
- Oh!
- I almost started to tear up,
because I immediately think,
"Oh, my god, I have the
opportunity to call my grandma."
- Are you ready to play?
all: Yes!
- When I call your names,
swish on down.
Yara Sofia, swish on down!
[laughing]
- I would love to call my mom.
She's gonna be so excited.
She's gonna be like,
"Are you eating?"
- Delta Work, swish on down!
[laughing]
Carmen Carrera, swish on down!
[laughing]
All right, so let's go
to the puzzle.
This puzzle is Shit RuPaul Eats.
[laughter]
Let's go.
[clock ticking]
[bell rings]
Delta.
- Two piece and a biscuit.
- Oh, my goodness!
[cheers and applause]
Condragulations, Delta Work!
This next puzzle
is Shit RuPaul Says.
[clock ticking]
Buzz in when you know.
[bell rings]
Raja, what is your answer?
- Eleganza extravaganza!
- Oh!
- Raja is right!
All right, the last three queens
to play.
This round
is Shit RuPaul Plugs.
- Oh.
- Oh, dear.
[clock ticking]
Buzz in when you think you know
the answer.
[bell rings]
All right, Shangela.
What is your answer?
- Available on...iTunes.
- That is correct!
Condragulations, Shangela.
- Word!
- All right, Delta and Raja,
whoever wins this round
will be the winner
of the mini challenge.
This puzzle is
Ghetto Shit RuPaul Says.
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay?
[clock ticking]
Buzz in when you think you know
the answer.
No answers yet.
[bell rings]
All right.
Delta Work,
what do you have?
- She done already done had
herses.
- Yes, ma'am!
- Whoo!
- Yeah, she done already done
had herses!
Delta, you win!
[cheers and applause]
You've won yourself
a phone call home.
Ladies, I hope your charisma,
uniqueness, nerve, and talent
are all warmed up,
because for this week's
main challenge,
you're going to be guest stars
on a game show
we like to call...
Snatch Game!
[cheers and applause]
This is your chance to bring
to life
your best celebrity
impersonations.
Bottom line, you need to be
an entertainer
who really entertains.
I'll be back a little later to
check on your progress.
Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best Cher win,
okay?
- I remember Shangela saying,
"Oh, I would call
my grandmother,
and I would love
to just check up on her."
And I thought to myself,
"I don't need the phone call
right now."
Well, listen, the more I hear
about your grandmother
and, like, how she's kind of
on her own,
the phone call would be
better used by you, I think.
- Oh, my god!
- You want it?
- It was a really sincere gift
that was so unselfish of her.
It touched me.
- So what you doing?
- Child, miss,
I'm Joan Crawford.
- Oh, work.
Do you ever do, like,
impersonations?
- Oh, bitch, I got this nailed.
I am Joan Crawford.
Yes.
- I'm debating between
Anna Nicole and Fran Drescher.
- I don't even know.
Who is that?
- Fran Drescher.
- You are doing Tina?
- Nico-Tina Turner.
She's doing Nico-Tina.
I'm doing Alicia Keys.
- Okay, I think I've decided
on it.
- What have you decided on?
- Anna Nicole.
- Girl, you're being
a bit flip-floppy.
- I've decided
I'm gonna do Anna Nicole
because she loves pink;
I love pink myself.
Should I make
a silver and pink dress?
- W-w-a-n-d.
What would Anna Nicole do?
I love my girl Stacy.
But I don't feel that she's
completely confident
in what she's saying.
So I'm wondering, "Is she gonna
be able to pull this off?"
- Today we're doing
the Snatch Game,
celebrity impersonation.
- I'm a little concerned
about my character,
'cause I don't think
Alicia Keys is funny.
- So how are you gonna
combat that?
- I'll do my best, honey.
- So, um, what are you
gonna do?
- Um, I'm gonna do
Imelda Marcos.
- Yay!
- After all this, like, Asian
accent talk this morning,
I think that I'm gonna go out
on a limb
and do another Asian accent.
I'm going to be showing a lot of
my Filipino pride.
[door squeaking open]
- Hello, lady-kins!
- Hi!
- Hi, Ru!
- Hey, Delta.
What you have here?
- I am doing Cher.
- What?
- I know.
- I happen to know she's a fan
of this show.
- Oh, wow.
- You know
she'll be watching this.
- Oh, my gosh.
- Yeah, no pressure.
Every queen in the world is
gonna be watching this,
and everyone
who's ever done Cher
is gonna be watching this.
- Sure.
- So you have to represent.
- I can certainly try.
- Hey, Raja.
- Hi, Ru.
- Who do we have here?
- I'm doing Tyra.
- Now, didn't she win the last
<i>RuPaul Drag Race?</i>
- No, not the other Tyra,
the actual Tyra.
- [giggles]
- I wanted to do her
'cause this is someone
that I know firsthand,
and I've been in the same room
with all of her Tyra-isms.
Sometimes she's, like,
quite proper
and she seems really educated,
and then she'll just like,
"Hey!"
You know, "Mm-hmm!"
- Tyra-ize them, hunty.
- Honey, word!
Uh!
- [laughs]
Yara Sofia.
- Hi.
- Hola, mami.
- Hola.
- Who do we have here?
- Amy Winehouse.
- You're from Puerto Rico.
- Yes.
- She's from England.
- England.
- How are you gonna do that?
[laughs]
- Well, I've been watching
Hatty Potter, so probably--
- Harry Potter?
- Hatty Potter, yeah.
- Let me hear some of your
English accent.
[both laughing]
- [with not an English accent]
Can I have some water?
- [laughs]
- How'd it sound?
- By George,
I think you've got it!
- Really?
- Yes.
All right, darling,
I'm gonna go this way.
Carmen Carrera.
- Hi, my love.
- Look at that face.
It's beat down.
Now, I see that you have padded
your already fat ass even more.
Stand up.
Let me take a look.
Are you doing J.Lo?
- I am.
- You are doing J.Lo?
- Yeah.
- You know that you are sitting
behind a desk?
- Well, I asked for a throne,
so I'm just hoping that
I have that when I get there,
'cause I'm gonna be
really upset,
and I'm gonna have to call
somebody.
- Yes, thank you very much,
Jennifer.
And I will see you on the set.
- Yes.
- All right, see you
in a minute.
- Thank you.
- Alexis Mateo.
- Hi, Ru.
- I know exactly who this is.
- Who is it?
- It's Alicia Keys.
- Oh, you got it right.
- How are you gonna make
Alicia Keys funny?
- I'm gonna be a pregnant, butch
Alicia Keys.
- [giggles]
Well,
Miss Stacy Layne Matthews.
I see a blonde wig.
Dolly Parton?
- Anna Nicole.
- How are you gonna convey
Anna Nicole Smith?
- The fabulous shoes
with the pink on them.
- Oh, okay.
- With my purse.
- So you're gonna rely on your
purse and your shoes?
Listen, I gotta tell you,
I'm not sold.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, because you know
you were in the bottom two
last week.
- Yes.
- What are you gonna do to
ensure
you won't be there again
this week?
- I'm gonna give everything
I have, because--
- Well, you said that last time,
giving everything.
It's got to be more than just,
"I'm gonna give
everything I have."
- I'm gonna bring
something new.
- You got to bring it, baby.
- I will.
- I'm rooting for you,
Stacy Matthews.
- Thank you, Ru.
- All right, baby.
And they call this queen Mariah.
- Howdy do?
- Oh, my go--am I feeling
a little Joan Crawford here?
- Yes.
- I love it!
- Okay, she was such a bitch,
and I love her.
- Well, it's funny you're doing
Joan Crawford,
because a lot of the criticism
you've gotten
on the main stage
are all the things
that Joan Crawford is not.
She's strong. She's powerful.
She's concise.
- I'm very much Joan Crawford.
I don't think that on the runway
I've never given anything
but confidence and strength
and poise and elegance.
- Mariah, will you walk me
to my car?
[giggles]
All right, ladies,
gather around.
Today's Snatch Game contestants
are sexy celebrities
in their own right.
Model and red carpet phenomenon
Amber Rose is here.
[applause]
- Oh, my god, what?
Amber Rose?
I love Amber Rose.
- And one of my favorites,
actress and comedienne
Aisha Tyler will be here.
- Oh, wow.
- Amber and Aisha are also
your guest judges this week.
all: Ooh.
- Yes.
Ladies, the game is on.
Good luck,
and don't fuck it up.
All right, see you later.
- Bye, Ru.
- I just want to punch a wall.
Why am I here?
Why am I here?
I feel like this is the lowest
point in the whole competition.
Whatever.
- What are you over?
- Well, she keeps bringing
the god damn bullshit up.
I can't...
- What do you mean?
- "Well, you said that
last week."
Don't keep bringing that up.
That's not helping me.
- Stacy, maybe that is trying
to help you.
- But it's not.
- But that's what I'm saying,
is maybe she's trying
to give you a heads-up.
I know how you feel.
But if she gave you
that recommendation
of she's not feeling it,
I would come up
with something else.
Who else--who else
is pop culture right now
that you can do?
- What about Mo'nique?
- Mo'nique.
Do fucking Mo'nique.
- [sighs]
- Don't get frustrated.
Let's do this.
- I don't want to give up,
because this is a dream for me.
I don't want to go
the fuck home.
- Hello, and welcome
to the new Snatch Game.
I'm your host, RuPaul.
Now let's meet our first
contestant.
She's a model from South Philly.
Please welcome Amber Rose.
- Hi.
- Up next, she's a talented
actress and comedienne.
Please welcome Aisha Tyler.
Hello, Aisha.
- Hello.
- And let's give
a Hollywood hello
to our star-studded celebrity
panel.
Well, hello, Cher.
- Hi, Ru.
- So happy you're here.
- Well, you know, I don't know
what the hell I'm doing here.
I'm a fucking Oscar winner.
- [laughing]
And next to her, we have
the former first lady
of the Philippines.
Imelda Marcos is with us.
- Mabuhay, mabuhay!
- At least this time, she picked
a Filipino.
- Of course, next to her, we
have media mogul and supermodel
Tyra Banks is in the house.
Hello, Tyra.
- Hey, Ru.
- Girl, I saw you smiling
with your eyes.
What do they call that?
- Smizing.
- [laughing]
- Next to her, we have Academy
Award winner Mo'nique.
Mo'nique, is everything...
- Precious!
- Uh-oh, is Precious
back there?
- Mm-hmm, she better be
cooking me something to eat.
- [laughing]
All right, ladies and gentlemen.
With us
is the fantastic Tina Turner.
Hello, Tina.
- All right, RuPaul.
- Are you gonna be nice or
rough on the Snatch Game?
- I always do it rough.
- [laughing]
- Next to her is the late, great
Joan Crawford.
Now, that is not a wire hanger.
- It's not.
- What is it?
- It's a wooden hanger.
- Mariah's Joan Crawford,
I think it's a little crunchy,
and I don't think Joan
would ever allow herself
to look that bad.
- Next to her, of course, is
Grammy winner Alicia Keys.
- Ooh, ooh!
New York!
Now, Alicia, a little birdie
tells me
that you got a secret
to tell us.
- Yo, I am pregnant,
and I am fierce, ah!
- All right, next to her
is the incomparable--
Jennifer Lopez is with us.
And, honey, I got your rider.
- Yeah, compliment, compliment,
question.
- Yes, yes.
- Thank you.
- Next to her is England's
gorgeous rock superstar
Amy Winehouse.
Hey, Amy.
- Hi, how are you?
- [laughing]
- I think this is your first
game show in America.
Have you done game shows
in England?
- Yes, yes.
[garbled speech] Once.
Um, I have...
- Yes.
All right, Amber, Aisha, I will
ask a series of questions,
and our celebrities will fill in
the blanks.
You give an answer you think
will match theirs.
Are you ready to snatch
the stars?
- Mm-hmm.
- Yes.
- Starting with Aisha.
Crazy Daisy is so crazy, she
thinks a Kardashian is a...
- Country in Africa.
- That's a very good answer.
Let's see if you got any matches
up here.
Oh, you've got more shoes,
Imelda.
- These ones have sparkles
on here.
It match your outfit.
- Did you write down
your answer? Good, good.
- Designer shoe?
- Not a match
but a very good answer.
All right, Tyra.
- I only have one answer
in my hand.
And this answer
is the only answer.
Naomi Campbell
is a come-guzzling whore!
I hate her. I hate her.
I hate her!
She ruined my life!
- [laughing]
- Smizing.
- All right, Mo'nique.
- Yeah?
- No, it's cool. It's cool.
We cool, Mo'nique.
- Hold up.
- Yeah, baby.
All right, let's go to the great
Joan Crawford.
- My eyebrows.
- "My eyebrows."
- That was almost...
nothing like what I put down,
but...
- All right, let's go
to Amy Winehouse.
Crazy Daisy thinks a Kardashian
is a...
- Lubricant remover.
- Lubricant remover.
- That's a great answer,
actually.
- It is a great answer.
Unfortunately, Aisha,
it's not a match.
Up next, Amber Rose.
Psycho Sally is so psycho,
instead of kissing her dates
good night, she blanks them.
- She stabs them.
- Let's start with Cher.
Instead of kissing her dates
good night...
- She buys them tickets
to my never-ending tour.
- Not a match.
All right, Tyra Banks.
- That answer is "smizes."
- She smizes them.
- And Naomi Campbell
is a come-guzzling whore!
- [laughing]
Tita Turter, what do you have?
- She sends them rollin' down
the river.
All right.
- All right, Joan Crawford,
Psycho Sally...
- She cuts their rose bushes.
- No, unfortunately, that is
not a match.
- Mariah could've given us
a little bit more drama.
You always remember
the shrieking kind of--
you know, that intensity
from Joan Crawford
and especially
in<i> Mommie Dearest.</i>
It would've been nice to see
a little bit more
of that extremity.
- Alicia Keys, let's see
if you match Amber Rose.
- I match you, Amber.
- Yes.
- Completely.
- Psycho Sally, what does she
do with her dates?
- She give them the number.
Call me, baby.
I'm just waiting for you.
- [laughing]
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Jennifer Lopez.
Now, Psycho Sally is so psycho,
instead of kissing her dates
good night...
- She actually marries them to
promote her next album.
- Oh, that's what she does.
Now, Aisha, Freaky Fanny
is so freaky,
instead of shaking hands,
she shakes...
- Schlongs.
- Schlongs.
- Trips off the tongue.
- What'd you got, Cher?
- It's not a match.
- Not a match.
- She shakes with age.
- See, that would never happen
to you, doll.
- Never.
- Never, never, never.
Mo'nique.
Freaky Fanny is so freaky,
instead of shaking hands,
she shakes...
- A chicken leg in my face,
'cause the bitch know
I'm hungry.
Bitch know it.
I'm hungry as hell.
- We'll see you about
getting you some food
over here, all right.
Let's go to the great
Joan Crawford.
- Since I lost Barbara,
could we get Mo'nique to come
and be my new housekeeper?
- Well, you're both
Academy Award winners.
- Fuck that skinny bitch.
- Okay, all right, all right.
Now, Joan, what do you have,
darling?
- Shake the shit
out of Christina.
- Aw.
Not a match.
Tyra, is there anything going on
that you want to tell us about?
- What?
- Are you smizing too hard?
- I think I've smized so hard,
my eyes bled, girl.
- Oh, my goodness!
She's smizing her head off
over there.
But you still look gorgeous.
- Thanks, girl.
Word.
Peeeeeace!
- All right, next round.
Dirty Diana is so dirty,
she washes her weave with...
- Lysol.
- With Lysol.
'Cause she's dirty.
- Yeah.
- All right, we'll go directly
to the Philippines
and Imelda Marcos.
- Don't cry for me,
Filipinos.
- Yes, darling, yes.
Dirty Diana is so dirty, she
washes her weaves with...
- Sweat from my feet.
- Sweat from your feet.
- Oh, 'cause of wearing
all these shoes!
- Yes, they must sweat
terribly.
- All right, Tita Turter.
- You want to know one thing?
- Yes, I want to know.
- You want to know why?
- I want to know why.
- Love.
- Love. What's love
got to do with it?
- Don't--no, no, no.
Mm-mm, can't do it.
- All right, keep it real,
Tina.
- All right, real.
I'm a long way from Nutbush, Ru.
Hallelu.
- [laughs]
- That is maybe the worst
Tina Turner I have ever seen.
She was like, "I...
"I don't know, like, hallelu.
"What's love got to do with it?
Hallelu."
- All right, Alicia Keys!
- She got her number, yeah.
- I'm writing a new song.
It's called<i> Amber.</i>
- Amber, okay.
- Yes.
- I think there should be an
Amber Alert out for Alicia Keys.
All right, Dirty Diana is so
damn dirty, girl.
- Mm-hmm.
- She wash her weaves
with what?
- Dush?
- With douche.
- With a douche.
- With a douch--
- Oh, that's the hood spelling.
- That's the hood, baby.
- She meant to write "douche,"
but she write "dush."
- Oh!
- Yeah.
Unfortunately, we have run
out of time.
Amber, Aisha,
the final score is...
Who cares?
On behalf of all our stars,
thank you for joining us
on the new Snatch Game!
Good-bye, everybody!
See you next time.
[applause]
- I haven't been able to talk
to my grandma
since I came
into this competition.
[phone line rings]
And we talk, like, every day.
- Hi.
- Hey, Grandma, it's me, DJ.
We were raised in a Southern
Baptist lifestyle.
And I know that it was
a big shift to go,
"Oh, my god, my grandson's
a drag queen now."
But my gram loves me.
She's been one of my biggest
supporters.
- Just have to keep going.
Just don't give up.
- No, I'm not gonna give up.
I promise that.
- Okay.
- Today when I'm talking
with her on the phone,
it just reinspires me
for this competition.
I don't want to let her down.
- Good morning.
- Hello, hello, hello.
- So we're back in the workroom,
and the look for today
on the runaway
is to look fabulous
in our favorite drag.
But not everyone is at the most
confident right now.
- Is this what you wear usually?
- Uh-huh.
- God, I'm swimming in it.
It's so huge.
Squeezing the gas out of me.
- Well, imagine
this is what I wear.
- This is why you fart so much.
- This is, like, what?
A twenty--
Oh, this is a 34.
- Oh! No.
A 34 in where?
This better be 34 in Europe.
- Yeah, this is my
best friend right here.
And my mom's on the other wall
over there.
- What about your dad?
- Passed away.
- When?
- About two years ago.
I was mad at him
most of my life.
Just being on drugs so much
and, like, stealing.
And he was on crack, basically.
- Right.
I'm starting to understand
a lot more
of why Stacy
is the way Stacy is.
- The way I was raised
and the way I grew up,
having to deal with my dad,
I feel like it made me nervous.
Like, I have panic attacks.
But, you know, I've learned
to control 'em.
I feel like me and Shangela
have grown so close
in this competition.
I can open up to her and share
pretty much anything.
And we fall out.
- Oh!
She's like my sister.
[upbeat music]
- Mariah?
- Help.
Look, look, look, look,
look, look, look.
Help.
- Come on, barbershop.
- It's just the story
of Shangela.
She's got all personality,
but how much skill
does she have
as someone who can, you know,
put herself together?
She always has somebody
helping her out.
She's got her little minions
over there.
- Clearly, there's two cliques
going on,
and one of the cliques
is Shangela's handmaidens.
She look like Tina Turner
after Ike beat her down.
- These conniving bitches are
talking about my sister, honey.
And so of course I'm gonna go
tell her, honey.
- Who?
- The clique.
- Initially, I thought,
"Well, I'm gonna go over
and find out what they're saying
about me."
But, honestly,
what will that change?
When people are talking
about you,
that means
you're doing something right.
This hair is not soundproof.
- If she hears it,
then she hears it.
I don't have to scream it
out loud,
but I will use my normal tone
of voice,
and I will let her know that
"you know what?
Do it yourself."
- Just so you know, Cousin It
can still hear you.
- What makes a good
impersonator,
and what makes a good female
illusionist?
- Carmen, you should've asked
this question yesterday.
- Right.
Maybe I should've thought of
y'all answers yesterday.
- Don't be a jerk!
Such a jerk.
- Sorry.
- I remember my elementary
school teacher
called me a jerk one time.
- Really?
- I called her a heifer.
I grew up in Gainesville,
Georgia.
It was not the easiest
experience.
No, I pretty much was picked on
for one reason or another.
Either I sounded too white
or I wasn't black enough.
I just didn't fit in.
I just knew I needed to get
where I had a lot more
opportunity.
And I stumbled into the world
of drag.
Girl, I'm gonna get my life.
And if the arrow goes real high,
hooray for you.
- [laughing]
[RuPaul's<i> Cover Girl]</i>
And what?
[applause]
Hey, guys.
Welcome to the main stage of<i> </i>
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
Hey, Michelle.
- Hey, baby!
- Santino.
- Hey, Ru, I missed you.
- I wrote you letters.
Did you not get them?
- [chuckles]
- Amber Rose.
- Hi, Ru.
- So happy you're here.
- Thank you for having me.
- Aisha Tyler.
- Ru, Ru, yoo-hoo.
- This week,
we challenged our girls
to do their best celebrity
impressions.
Tonight they've come
to the main stage
wearing their favorite
drag looks.
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win!
It looks like she's going back
to her roots.
- I love the dark, wicked
bitch look.
I feel so powerful.
- Very Gaultier.
- It is Gaga Gaultier.
- Shangela.
- Oh, and the reveal.
What?
- I picked out this beautiful,
cream-colored structure gown--
design couture.
- First time
you see a black woman
whose hair can provide shelter
from the rain.
- Can you save me a slice of
that hair pie?
They call this queen Mariah.
- Her legs are amazing.
- Gorgeous legs.
- I am a wild animal
on the runway.
I stalk my prey, I hunt,
and I pounce.
- Let me just say,
as a black woman,
I have a very flat ass.
And now I know
where it all went.
- It all went to Mariah.
She took it all.
Raja.
- Two tribes go to war.
- That's right.
Shaka Zulu, honey.
- The look I've chosen
is quite global,
just kind of<i> </i>
<i>National Geographic</i><span style="bodyStyle"> drag.</i>
Apocalypto Amazon gal.
- She served you up
on the Serengeti.
- Girl, the natives are
restless.
Alexis Mateo.
- Quinceañera.
- This, by the way,
is one of the real housewives
of Puerto Rico.
- I am wearing a creation from
one of my friends,
and I just feel like a princess.
- It makes me hungry
for some sherbet.
Carmen Carrera.
She's at the cabana by the pool
serving glamour.
- I'm feeling like a supermodel
on the runway right now.
My head held high
and just kind of, like,
letting the chiffon blow
behind me.
- Look at that chassis.
- And look at the
undercarriage.
- She's one fierce
mother tucker.
- Stacy Layne Matthews.
Formerly Stacy Layne Bryant,
but she got married.
- This gold coat is my
signature piece.
I'm feeling very confident
in what I'm wearing.
Stacy Matthews has arrived.
- This face is just popping.
- See, now, Mo'nique should have
worn this to the Oscars.
Delta Work.
- Got to love a pantsuit.
- Ann-Margret.
- Ann-Margret...
after the buffet.
- On the runway, I'm feeling
confident today.
I feel great.
I love my outfit.
- That red hair is so gorgeous
on her.
- Delta, you better wooooork!
- Manila.
- Very Twiggy.
- That must be
the Filipino flag.
- I'm getting pinay fish
in this really, really, really
cute Filipino flag dress.
- Filipino couture.
- From the house of Imelda.
- All right, ladies.
Fun and games are over.
When I call your name,
step forward.
Raja.
Stacy.
Alexis.
You are the top three.
Yara.
Delta.
Mariah.
You...
are the bottom three.
Carmen. Shangela. Manila.
You three are safe.
And "safe" is a word
that I have come to loathe
in this competition.
Moving forward, I want you to
make bold choices
worthy of America's next
drag superstar.
You three may leave the stage.
Ladies, you represent the
best and the worst of the week.
It's time
for the judges' critiques.
Let's start with Raja.
- All I have to say is...
[clicking tongue]
- Well, fuck you too.
[laughter]
- You bring it to the runway
every time.
And I love this global warrior
princess you've got going on.
And as far as your Tyra Banks, I
laughed out loud several times.
- I thought because
you know her so well,
you could've done so much more,
because she is a human
caricature.
- I loved
your runway look today.
I thought that it was bold,
drama.
You know, it really felt
editorial.
It really felt high fashion.
And that was really exciting
to see.
- Thank you, Raja.
Up next, Alexis Mateo.
- I loved your Alicia Keys.
You killed that.
It was so, so funny.
- I love the color,
and I love the bling on it.
You look like a real housewife
of Dubai.
- I love gaudy things,
and that's very gaudy
and sparkly and glamorous.
And I think you look great.
And the fact that you were
flirting with me was a plus.
And I was like, "Damn, I'm gonna
get some Alicia tonight."
[laughter]
- Stacy.
You told me that you were going
to be Anna Nicole Smith.
What had happened?
- I feel like I'm relating more
to Mo'nique,
so that's why I switched.
- You stayed physically
in that character.
Your facial expression
was completely different.
You know, you had the--
yeah, and you held it, mama.
You never fell out.
Look at--
[laughter]
- You're so beautiful.
I mean, you're representing
the big girls,
and you're doing a great job.
I mean, you have, like, breasts,
and it looks amazing.
You look so good.
Like, wow.
- I'm so proud of you tonight,
Stacy.
You stepped it up this week.
You need to now realize
that you can't go back.
- Yep.
- All right, thank you, Stacy.
Raja, Alexis, Stacy...
you may leave the stage.
Yara Sofia.
Let's start with you.
Aisha?
- I loved your look today.
I thought it was really
original.
It was really exciting.
That being said, I struggled
a little bit
with your Amy Winehouse.
I could not understand the
accent that you were doing.
I was like, "Is she German?"
- I'm totally into your
dark, wicked bitch look
that you got going on.
I like your own brand
of what you're bringing
to this competition.
- Because Amy is such a big
character, we want more.
You have it.
Give it all.
- I will. I will.
- Next up, Mariah.
How'd you feel
walking the runway?
- Frankly, I'm surprised to be
down here.
I definitely believe that
there's someone more qualified
to be in my position right now.
- Who?
- Carmen Carrera.
She played a bitchy version of
herself.
If I wanted to be offensive,
I could play a knock-off
Filipino.
But I'm not a judge, so--
- I'll speak for myself.
You know,
being a Joan Crawford fan,
I was so happy that you chose
to do that role.
I was disappointed, though,
that there were a lot of missed
opportunities with punch lines.
Were you happy with your
performance?
- I was--I was--I was pleased
with my performance, yes, ma'am.
- All right.
Next up, Delta.
- If you're gonna be a queen
and you're gonna deliver Cher,
bitch, you better deliver Cher.
You were shy Cher.
- There are so many Cher-isms,
and I didn't want to rely
on what you've seen.
And I thought what I would do
was amp it up,
and I didn't turn the knob
completely.
- Delta, what's going on?
Why are you holding back?
- Thank you, ladies.
I think we've heard enough.
While you enjoy
an Absolut cocktail
in the Interior Illusions
Lounge,
the judges and I will
deliberate.
You may leave the stage.
Okay, just between us girls,
what do you think?
Let's start with Raja.
- Raja on the runway was,
for me,
far and away, the top dog today.
- Being that she has worked
with Tyra,
she could have made it
a little more irreverent.
- But then Tyra would have sued
the shit out of us.
[laughter]
Let's talk about Alexis.
- Her Alicia
was fully realized,
not just the voice
but the look, the physicality,
the jokes.
It was like
your granddaddy's boat;
it was tightened up.
- I'm kind of stuck with Alexis.
- Really?
- 'Cause I feel like
she's stuck.
I feel like we're seeing the
same thing in different colors.
- But she killed Alicia Keys,
in a good way.
- Well, let's move on
to Mo'nique.
- She was funny even when
she didn't speak.
She really was in that character
at all times.
- As far as the runway goes,
really?
Your favorite drag look are
those pants,
which happen to be--
you know, she's hanging
with her besties,
Poly and Esther.
- Yara Sofia.
- Obviously, the accent
did not work.
- In the beginning,
it was funny.
Then it got, like, really dry
and not in a good way.
- But she made brave choices
on the runway.
The dreads were off the hook.
That face makeup was what-what.
- Miss Mariah.
- I don't understand
the black cheeks.
- It was Lily Munster.
- It was!
That wasn't Joan Crawford.
She would never go out without
blending all that in.
- It was a really bad
Joan Crawford.
There was just so much
that she didn't do.
- Well, it's been her criticism
before
that she sort of fakes her way
to the middle.
- She could sleep her way to
the top.
- Even when you get to the top,
you're gonna have to have
something to deliver.
Delta Work.
- It's Cher. You learn that
in Drag School 101.
- You need to have
that confidence.
When you walk into a room,
it's like, "Honey, I'm here,
and I'm Cher."
She didn't do that.
- I just want to say to Delta,
"Schnap out of it!"
Silence!
I've made my decision.
Tina!
Bring me the axe.
Welcome back, ladies.
Now, based on your performance
in the Snatch Game
and your presentation
on the main stage,
I've made some decisions.
Raja...
your impersonation of Tyra Banks
smizing
brought tears to my eyes.
You're safe.
Alexis Mateo.
No one, no one, no one
can do Alicia Keys like you.
You're safe.
- Stacy, I had all but given up
on you.
But you played
to your strengths,
and you came out on top.
Isn't that precious?
- Yes.
- Condragulations, you are the
winner of this challenge.
[applause]
And you've won a cruise for two
to the Bahamas
from ALandCHUCK.travel.
- After being in the bottom
and all these bitches
talking shit,
saying, "Stacy Matthews,
why are you here?"
Fuck those bitches, honey.
- However,
you will not be immune
from elimination next week.
From this point forward, no one
will receive immunity.
Ladies, make every moment count.
Mariah...
your impersonation
of Joan Crawford
was not Mildred Fierce.
I'm sorry, my dear, but you are
up for elimination.
- Being bottom two,
I didn't realize
how emotional it could be.
It's definitely intense.
- Yara Sofia.
Playing a mess does not give you
permission to be messy.
Delta Work,
your impersonation of Cher
didn't make any of us believe.
I'm sorry, Delta, but you are up
for elimination.
- To see Stacy win
and I'm in the bottom two
was, just, like, the travesty
that's gonna go down
in, like, history as WTF.
- Yara, you may join
the other girls.
Two queens stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me
and save yourself
from elimination.
The time has come...
for you to lip-sync
for your life.
Good luck.
And don't fuck it up.
- Even though Mariah's really
serving it,
Mariah doesn't know her words
too well.
But Delta's hitting, like,
every word.
Mariah's just, like, there,
like...
- I knew most of the words to
the lip-sync song,
but there was some gaps, so
I'm gonna make up something.
Fill in the gaps, bitch, with
"elephant shoe," honey,
"cantaloupe,"
and "sha-laba-laba-tuna."
- Yes!
[cheers and applause]
- Yes!
- Ladies...
I have made my decision.
Delta Work...
shantay, you stay.
- Thank you
for the second chance.
- My beautiful queen.
This is not the end.
This is the emancipation
of Mariah.
Now sashay away.
- Thank you.
[applause]
I'm feeling entertained.
Their judgment was interesting.
It wouldn't have mattered if I'd
have done anything differently.
You play the game and then go.
It's gonna be hell
getting the bags back home.
- Condragulations, ladies.
You are all one step closer
to becoming America's next
drag superstar.
And remember,
if you can't love yourself,
how in the hell are you gonna
love somebody else?
Can I get an amen up in here?
all: Amen!
- All right,
let the music play!
[RuPaul's<i> Main Event]</i>
- RuPaul's menswear provided
by Moods of Norway.
Grand prize contributed
in part by ALandCHUCK.travel.


- Previously on<i> RuPaul's</i>
<i>Drag Race...</i>
I'm gonna give you an
opportunity to really wig out.
- Yes, Rainbow Brite.
- She-man the barbarian.
- A little new school Mae West.
- How much is that poodle on
the runway?
Yara Sofia.
Condragulations.
You are the winner
of this challenge.
Ladies,
I have made my decision.
Alexis Mateo.
Shantay, you stay.
Shangela,
sashay away.
Michelle.
I want you to confer with
Santino and Billy B.
To decide which
of the eliminated queens
deserve to return.
<i>And tonight...</i>
I want you to to meet
some real athletes.
- Come on in.
Whoo!
- It smells like testosterone.
-<i> With extra special</i>
<i>guest judges,</i>
<i>Sharon Osbourne</i>
<i>and Margaret Cho.</i>
- All: Whoo!
-<i> The winner of RuPaul's</i>
<i>Drag Race will receive,</i>
<i>a lifetime supply of Kryolan</i>
<i>Professional Make-up...</i>
<i>headline Logo's Drag Race tour,</i>
<i>featuring cocktails perfected,</i>
<i>by Absolut...</i>
<i>and a cash prize of $75,000.</i>
And may the best woman win.
- Pffft!
- No hair, no hair.
- Hello!
- Aw, it's a message from
Shangela.
We're back into the work room
today,
and Shangela is gone.
I'm gonna miss Shangela.
- Halleloo, Shangela.
- I'm gonna wipe it up.
- While you do that,
I'm gonna do one of these.
Woo-hoo!
- [laughing]
- Shangela's gone.
Good God, I feel like
the sky has parted.
I feel like I can frolic
through the woods
and perch a little bird
on my finger.
Sorry about it, Shangela.
- We are the top four.
- Not so much.
- When Ru said last week
on the runway
that another queen
is coming back,
I felt like, "All right,
we're top five again."
- Who do you think is coming?
- Um, I don't know.
- It could be Stacy.
Nah.
Mimi Imfurst.
- Oh, I hope not.
- Nah.
[alarm sounds]
-<i> Ooh, girl.</i>
<i>You've got shemail.</i>
<i>Is the next drag superstar</i>
a catcher or a pitcher?<i> </i>
- Ooh.
-<i> Does she have a tight end</i>
or a fullback?
Well, get ready
for a little one-on-one,
man-to-man action.
<i>And remember...</i>
<i>if you can't be an athlete,</i>
you can at least be
an athletic supporter.
- Aah!
- Hello, hello, hello.
- Hey, Ru!
- What's up, Ru?
- Boy, oh, boy.
Now as you know,
I gave the judges
a one-time opportunity
to bring back
one of the eliminated queens
if they could come to
a unanimous decision.
So...
let's see which queen,
if any,
is behind that door.
The moment of truth is upon us.
- I can't,
I don't wanna look.
- Oh, my God!
- I'm back, bitches.
- Whoo!
- It's a heather,
it's a heather.
- The Jersey girl is back.
- It's fucking Carmen.
- Carmen Carrera.
- Hey.
- Now is your head
back in the game?
- Yes.
I'm really happy that, you know,
the judges wanted me
to come back.
Like, that makes me feel
even more confident.
I feel like
I have to bring it now.
- Now for today's
mini-challenge,
we'll be headed outside...
to the padunkadunk
dunking machine.
[cheering]
- Oh!
- Woo-hoo-hoo!
- Now each of you
will get a turn
to dunk the queen
of your choice.
- Carmen.
- Carmen.
- Carmen.
Carmen three times, honey.
- The doll who dunks her victim
the most times
in two minutes, wins.
So put your suits on
and I'll meet you out there.
All right, ladies.
Raja, you throw first.
Choose your victim.
- Carmen.
- [laughing]
- On your mark,
get set...
padunkadunk!
- Go Raja.
- Go Raja, go!
- Raja, Raja!
- No, no, no, no!
- I have a feeling
Carmen's used to
having balls thrown at her face.
- So I'm sitting there
and I'm a little nervous.
I'm, like, "Damn,
she's gonna get me."
But she throws like a girl.
I mean, come on, miss thing.
[laughter]
[buzzer buzzes]
- Time's up.
All right, Alexis?
- Yes.
- Choose your victim.
- Yara.
- Ay!
Oh, ho, ho, hmm...
No, no, no, no!
- Get her, get her!
- All: Ooh!
- [screaming]
- Oh!
- Damn!
- Oh, my God!
- Fuck you!
[laughter]
- Bam, bitch!
Get it!
- Yara, you're up next.
Who do you pick
to be your victim?
- I don't know,
but I think Alexis.
- Alexis?
- Oh!
- Now, darling,
it's my turn.
- This is the revenge of Yara.
And go.
- Work it, Yara!
- Get her, get her!
- [laughing]
- Taste that water, darling!
Taste it!
- Oh! Oh!
- [laughing]
[buzzer buzzes]
- Time's up.
You got seven.
- Yes.
- Condragulations.
- Thank you.
- Up next is Manila.
- Let's go up there, honey.
- Yes!
- No!
- My bitch.
- I just got warm, and now I
have to get back in that bitch.
- Ah!
- No!
- Stay behind that line.
- Come on, Manila,
you can do this, girl!
- Missed!
- Aaah!
- Carmen's getting pretty dry
up there.
- Thank goodness,
Manila sucks.
- No!
- All: Oh!
[buzzer buzzes]
- Up next, of course, is...
Carmen, hmmm.
- I think I'm gonna
have to choose Raja.
- No!
- Yeah!
- I want her to gag.
- Dunk her ass
like a donut, okay?
- Nooo!
- Aah!
- [laughing]
- Raja!
- [laughing]
- All: Whoo!
- The harder you throw,
the more you look like a dude,
okay?
That's all I'm saying.
- Oh, my God!
[buzzer buzzes]
- Oh, time's up, time's up.
All right, ladies.
With a total of 14 dunks,
the star pitcher
of RuPaul's Pink Sox is...
Alexis Rodriguez Mateo!
Condragulations, Alexis.
Now you kids go dry off
and I'll see you back in the
you-better-work room.
See you in a minute.
- Bye!
- Bye, Ru!
- Okay, kids.
Now that you're all warmed up,
I want you to meet
some real athletes.
- Oh, shit!
- Whoo!
- Hey!
- Come on in, babies.
Come on in.
Whoo!
- There's five guys
coming into the work room
and it smells like testosterone.
- For this week's
main challenge,
you'll be transforming these
straight jocks
into drag queens for a day.
- Oh, my God!
- [laughing]
Now using your own drag,
hair from Wig USA,
and other materials
we've provided,
I expect to see
a strong family resemblance.
Think of them as the Venus
to your Serena.
Gentlemen,
please introduce yourselves
and tell us your sport.
- Hi, I'm Matt.
I'm 29, and I play baseball...
hard.
- Ooh!
- Ooh!
- Sorry about it.
- I'm Drew, I'm 23,
and I play rugby.
- My name is Slava, I'm 23,
and I play water polo.
- Hi, I'm Chevy, I'm 27,
I play baseball.
- My name's Christopher,
I'm 32,
I play basketball
from San Antonio, Texas.
- Yes.
- And yes, everything is bigger
in Texas.
- Now, Alexis, since you
won the mini-challenge,
you get to pair up
the guys and dolls.
- Heh, heh.
I love this part.
Come with me.
Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh.
Raja, meet your partner.
- Hey, my baby.
Come to mama.
- Manila, meet your partner.
- Hey!
- Bam!
You, come on.
Heh, heh, heh.
Yara.
- Oh!
Thank you, darling.
- Carmen.
Meet your partner.
With Chevy's body,
it's going to be very difficult
for Carmen
to stand on stage
naked like her.
And you're mine, yay.
I keep the best one for me.
Slava.
- Now turning these jocks
into drag queens
will take every ounce
of charisma,
uniqueness, nerve and talent
that you've got.
So put some muscle into it.
Gentlemen,
start your engines.
And may the best woman win.
- Yeah!
- Can I hit one out there?
- Nope, no baseball.
No sports today,
you're a lady.
- Yes.
- Oh, really? Doesn't matter.
- [laughing] Yeah.
- Sell it.
Hands on your hips,
hands on your hips, always.
- Hands on my hips.
- Yes, yes, yes.
- Hands on my hips.
I'm liking this shit.
- Yeah, you have, like,
a boner a little bit.
- It's a little one?
I think it's 'cause
the air is in there.
[laughing]
- I was like, "Okay, kill it."
It's not the first time
I got a straight guy excited.
- [laughing]
- Oh!
- So the challenge today is
we have to transform
these straight jocks
into our drag sisters.
- Yeah, those are gonna be
your tits.
- [laughing]
- I hope so.
It's like water polo.
- [gasping] You have to shave.
- I'm not shaving that.
That's my jungle hair over here.
- Drew, he's afraid
of what are we going to do.
- I have to be a jock
for a second.
- So now you're gonna play.
- Yes, I just--
I'll work a little,
and I'll play a little,
you know?
- I have a lot of work to do.
- Carmen, are we gonna have to
teach these boys how to tuck?
- I have to.
- Have you ever put your balls
up above your penis?
- Ooh.
- There's, like, a cavity
up in your body,
that sometimes
your testicles can--
they go up there
any time you want.
Like, it's a winter cabin
they can go hang out in
if it gets too cold.
- I'll show you so you can see
the contours on my body.
I'm welcoming him into the house
of Carrera.
The minute you tuck,
the minute you pull that pee-pee
back,
you feel like a woman.
You need to, like,
put your penis away.
- Put my penis away.
- Okay.
- So where does the shaft go?
- That's the one that goes
between your legs.
- And you've been doing this
for how long?
- A while now.
- And you're not all
tuckered out?
- Oh, hell no.
- These are my titties.
- Oh, my God.
- Be gentle with them.
- Oh, my God.
They're so soft.
They feel better
than the real thing.
- Slava is flirty, flirty,
flirty.
- I wanna hear about
your first guy kiss.
- My first guy kiss?
Oh, my gosh.
I was 15, he was 26.
He was straight.
Bam!
- No way.
- Yes.
- I respect that.
- Things that come out
of his mouth,
I'm going, like, "Really, dude,
focus right here.
We're trying to make you
a woman, not a husband."
- Hello, hello, hello.
- Hey, Ru.
- Hi, darling.
- Hello, there.
- Hey, Ru.
- Hi, Chris.
So Raja,
now what are you doing
that's gonna make you sisters?
- I'm gonna put my little stamp
as far as styling him,
and making him really feel
a little bit more like Raja.
- Do you have any surprises up
your sleeve, Raja?
- Not just yet.
I've gotta, like,
really dive in,
and we're gonna play with
some makeup
and then the surprise will
probably come at the end,
I hope.
I am looked at by the judges
as being someone
who puts on the funny, cool,
fashion-y costumes,
and does a fierce runway.
How do I make this guy
do the same thing that I do?
Dear God,
please help me.
- Carmen Carrera and Chevy.
It's like a car dealership,
isn't it?
- [laughing]
- How will we know
that the two of you are sisters?
- Well, we're gonna both be
serving body and sex.
- [laughing] Oh.
Well that sounds like
a Carmen Carrera sister.
- Yeah, the one and only
body queen.
- What are you the most
concerned about
in this challenge?
- He uses that sexuality.
- True.
- That's a tough one
right there.
- But it's many years
in the making.
- I don't think it's just
about the look.
I have to kind of transfer
that essence of Carmen Carrera
into this guy.
- Hey, Yara.
- Hi.
- Oh, my goodness.
You're shaving him.
- Yes.
- Are you shaving Drew all over?
- No, I didn't...
- [laughing]
No, no.
- He doesn't let me.
- What worries you
the most about this?
- I'm not much of a dancer
or anything,
so getting the footwork down
is really my main concern.
- But you play rugby.
Can we see you do
a little twirl?
You're wearing your heels now.
- Try it. Go, go.
[indistinct]
Hey, hey, whoa.
Walk, walk, walk, aah!
- But you know what?
I don't see much challenge
there, Yara.
I expect your sister
to have higher heels.
I want to see Liz Hurley,
fuck-me pumps on the runway.
- Okay.
- She's gonna reflect on you.
- Yes.
- So you have to call the shots.
- Yes, I will.
- Good luck, you guys.
- Thank you.
- All right, I'll see you later.
- Bye.
- Hey, Alexis.
- Hey, Ru.
- You have a sister, don't you?
- Yes.
- Do you get her into drag?
- No, she's a butch lesbian, Ru.
- What's your biggest challenge
in turning Slava into your
sister?
- Making him concentrate
while we have to work.
- It's focus.
Slava plays water polo.
You have to have focus
in sports.
Help him transfer that focus
into doing drag.
- Hey, Manila.
- Hi, Ru.
- What do you have planned out?
- Well, I'm going to be
putting him in, like,
this little kimono.
- Oh, my.
And will so much body
be showing?
- So much body will be showing.
- Wow.
What's your biggest challenge?
- Fuchsia's kind of a brick.
- Uh-huh.
- So I'm gonna have to
break down her face,
and make her as feminine
as possible.
Attractive manly men,
don't make attractive
drag queens.
Fuck. This is gonna be hard.
<i>- Gather around, everybody.</i>
Tomorrow,
on the main stage,
we will be joined
by our guest judges,
actress and comedian
Margaret Cho...
- All: Ooh!
- And the always cheerful,
Sharon Osbourne.
- Yay!
- Ooh!
- Oh, and one more thing.
In addition to the glamorous
looks you've been working on,
you need to style...
cheerleader outfits.
- Oh, okay.
- And then come up with
a fun fight cheer
that supports safe sex.
- [laughing]
Not only walking
on the runway as models,
now we have to cheerleading?
Oh.
- You'll both perform
your cheer tomorrow
on the main stage.
Go team go.
And remember,
don't fuck It up.
- Ready?
- Both: Okay!
- This week's main challenge
is to turn straight jocks
into our drag sisters.
And the twist is,
we have to do a cheerleading
routine about safe sex.
- Wrap your dick,
wrap up your dick.
- Wrap your dick!
- [laughing] Yes!
- Then we're gonna do the
And we're gonna switch.
- What's up, bitches?
- Oh, my God.
Wow.
This is disturbing.
Raja's jock look a mess.
- Yaay!
- I don't know
what the bitch was doing.
But girl,
you don't look that good.
- I don't know about
Raja's sister.
She's supposed to be a heather.
I don't know, she kind of looks
like a Sprepper.
It's basically a Sprite mixed
with Dr. Pepper.
It's not necessarily
a good thing.
It's usually, like,
a booger quality.
Like, oh!
Like, "That's such a Sprepper."
- It's time for me and Slava to
go to the runway and practice.
Look at the judges.
You give them poses.
- Oh, God!
- Keep the balance,
keep the balance.
Alexis Mateo always known
by the "Bam!"
So I'm making him
say it as well,
'cause he better show the judges
that he is part of
the fa-mi-ly.
Bam!
- Bam!
I'm a drama queen, bitch!
- No, you're not a drama queen.
You're a drag queen,
God damn it.
Come on, say it!
- Bam! Bam!
I'm a drag queen.
- I hope that everything
goes well
and he doesn't show more diva
than me tomorrow.
'cause we're gonna
have a problem.
- Mm-hmm.
- Bam!
- Look at the judges.
Seductive.
You want to fuck the judges.
I wanna fuck You guys.
Yes, I'm here.
Eat it, bitch.
You know what I mean?
Grab your waist.
Right.
Left.
<i>Echa pa lante,</i>
look at the judges.
- I'm looking.
- And then left.
No, we're gonna do right again.
Left.
I'm a little worried.
Get him the attitude.
- You better not complicate it.
- No, no, no.
- You're gonna regret this.
- I'm scared to go home.
- Ready, one, two, right foot.
I'll go slower.
Chris in heels,
it's a little funny.
It's not sexy yet.
- I just gotta learn
the count thing.
Are you gonna actually tell me?
- I'm just gonna tell you when.
- Okay.
- I'm gonna be, like,
"Let's go, Chris," all right?
So make sure that you're--
- Or, you mean my stage name.
- Yeah, Enigma.
Sorry, girl.
I know that he has
really good intentions.
But I know that I can only
do so much.
I don't want you to forget this,
'cause it's kind of important.
I'm just hoping that Chris
remembers the few steps
that I taught him
in front of the judges tomorrow.
- Titties up, titties up.
- Titties up.
- When you get here
and you do your twirl,
like, you can look down at your
ass and then look up at them.
- What about my titties,
is that just not cool?
I mean, I love titties.
- No, because I'm not, like,
a titty girl.
I'm like a butt girl.
- [laughing]
- Let's do it again.
- All right.
I only got about two more walks
down here in me.
- All the pain that
you're feeling right now
is the man leaving your body.
You're just becoming more
feminine and more feminine.
- How about my toes
leaving the shoe?
- Yeah.
He's just, like, complaining,
and he's just, like,
"Oh, my God."
And then give us a twirl
to show us body.
No, that's butch.
Be, like, really girly, like...
- When you're walking,
like, look at the judges.
- Okay.
- Okay?
- If you catch one of
their eyes, that's good.
- Can I point?
- Ladies don't point unless
they're picking out shoes.
I want those pairs.
- How's this?
- Well, don't--
what woman do you know
stands like that?
Oh!
Practice on this line,
by putting one foot
over the other
like you're doing a drug test.
Work the runway, fish!
- Fish?
- And strike another pose.
Matt has a really huge
personality.
Okay, you're gonna strike
a feminine pose.
- Oh, okay.
- Not like you're poppin'
a squat in the woods.
- Okay.
- Okay?
It gets annoying.
We'll work on the poses
when we're not on the runway.
I just want you
to get comfortable with--
I just want you to get
comfortable with the runway.
And if you do this
to me tomorrow,
I'm going to seriously
hunt you down...
- All right, all right!
- And kill you.
- I'm just having fun
on the stage, man!
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Does your family know
that you're straight?
- [laughing]
Yeah.
My little brother's gay.
- Oh, no way.
- Yeah, yeah.
He's one of those angry
gay people.
- Why?
- He just thinks that
everybody hates him
'cause he's gay or whatever.
Did you ever do drag
in high school?
- No, hell no.
I didn't come out
in high school.
I think people knew
that I was gay.
They didn't have the balls
to come and ask me.
I didn't have a sense of pride
in being gay.
- Uh-huh.
'Cause it was still taboo
to you.
- Yeah, that's why I was, like,
really angry at the world
for a little bit.
You feel wrong
for the most of your life.
And then you don't know why
you feel wrong.
And then you just get mad
at people.
Like, "why do you make me feel
wrong?" You know?
Well, how old is he now?
- 19.
He's 19 now.
- Oh, he's still really young.
- Just a kid.
- He'll get over all of that.
Trust me.
- I hope so.
- He will.
Once he sees his big brother
in drag.
- It's kind of a motivator
For me to do this, you know?
- Yeah.
He's gonna love it.
- Make sure that you don't eat
anything
that's gonna make you bloated
for tomorrow.
- Okay.
- But you're trying to make him
look like you.
So why wouldn't he be bloated?
- Ooh!
- Tell her her mom's bloated.
- You're--
- So we're teaching our sisters
to read.
- It's a natural talent
in a Luzon family, honey.
- You've got the perfect
daughter, Manila.
- Matt is just like Manila.
Completely obnoxious.
- Yo, you guys like
my lobster hat?
- Manila, meet your cell mate,
Matt.
- Do women really slap tables?
- I just slap tables
all day long,
you don't even know,
for real.
- Good morning.
- Challenge day.
We're back into the work room
and it's so much
that has to be done.
- Let's make you into a fish.
- I'm nervous as hell.
- No, no, you can do it.
You can do it.
- All right, all right.
- We are teammates, you know?
- All right.
- We need to practice.
Rush. Come on.
- Both:
Ready? You're gay.
- Keep your peeker--
Pecker.
Fuck.
- Pecker.
- What is a pecker?
- Keep your pecker--
- What is a pecker?
- Pecker is your dick.
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.
- We have the exact same amount
of time that we usually have,
except that this time, we have
to get ourselves in drag
and then a person that has never
been in drag before in drag.
[exhales]
All right. I'm ready for you.
- Whoa.
You're gluing his brows?
- Mm-hmm.
- What's it do?
- It lays them down and then
I can, like, cover them,
and then I can draw them
wherever I want to put
new eyebrows.
The most intimidating part
of this challenge
is that it's not just me.
I now have to, like,
completely do an overhaul
on this masculine straight guy.
- Ancient Chinese secret.
- Ancient drag secret.
- Did you have people who
came out in high school?
In your school,
in Puerto Rico?
- No, I was the only one.
- I had a really hard time
in high school.
I was, like, really close to,
like, being suicidal.
It was, like, left and right.
I couldn't, like,
walk around the school
without being, like,
tormented.
- But you know what,
I went to my ten-year
high school reunion in drag.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- How was the reception?
- Awesome.
- Yeah?
- We all had a blast together
for the first time in my life.
Like, I had a great time
with people I went to
high school with.
- [laughing]
- So you're legally married?
- Legally, yeah.
- So if you move--
- It would be invalid.
New Jersey's the only state
that really gives a lot
of the same rights
that they give
a straight married couple.
- So you're stuck
in the armpit of America
because you're gay.
- I think that straight people
take a lot of things
for granted.
You can settle down
with any girl and have kids
and live the American dream,
but it's, like,
so much harder for gay people
to do that.
- Turn around.
It's not that difficult.
- Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
When I first saw myself
transformed,
my heart just stopped.
My breath just gasped,
and I was, like, whoa!
I can't even believe this.
Oh, my God.
- Alexis' jock...
he's a drag queen.
This is your first time?
Mm-hmm.
- We're gonna run out together,
shake your pom pom's like crazy.
Just be, like, aaaah!
And then we stop at the edge
of the stage--
- Oh, we perform on stage?
- Yeah.
- Oh, wait, wait, please.
Please just--please don't.
Really, honestly.
Dude, focus!
Please!
Like, I'm on the line, here.
- Are you angry at me?
- No, I'm just really,
like, freaking out.
- You'll be all right.
Take a deep breath, bro.
- Thank you.
- [laughing]
- Well, hello there.
Welcome to the main stage
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
Michelle Visage,
you're looking sporty.
- Yay, team!
- [laughing]
- Mike Ruiz,
A-list photographer.
Welcome back.
- Oh, thanks for having me back.
- Margaret,
you're Cho beautiful.
- Thank you.
Well, I was raised
by drag queens,
like some are raised by wolves.
So I know drag.
- Well then,
welcome home sweetheart.
Sharon Osbourne,
the coolest mom ever.
Welcome to the show.
- Thank you, my darling.
- How's Ozzy?
- All I can tell you is, Ru,
he absolutely adores you.
- [laughing]
Welcome.
This week,
our queens were challenged
to turn straight jocks into
their glamorous drag sisters.
But first, we asked them to lead
a fun fight cheer
in support of safe sex.
Gentlemen,
start your engines.
And may the best woman win.
- Both: Whoo!
Divas, divas, here we go!
Safe sex is the way to go!
Ooh, you wanna moan?
Ooh, you wanna growl?
Make it safe!
And make us proud!
- I love you.
- And you love me.
- Both:
Safe sex fraternity!
Whoo!
- Safe sex mother fuckers!
- Wrap that dick!
Safe sex, don't get pregnant!
- Both: Ready?
You're gay!
- B-A-R-E!
- B-A-C-K!
- Both: No bareback,
no bareback!
No, no, no bareback!
- I need a C!
- C!
- I need an O!
- O!
- Give me an N!
- N!
- How bout a D?
- D!
- Another O!
- O!
- Another M!
- M!
- What's it spell?
- Both: Safe sex!
Woo-hoo!
- All: [laughing]
- Both: Ready?
Let's go!
- Give your back a cleaning!
- Have that rubber
catch that semen!
- Give me that W!
- W!
- Give me the R!
- R!
- Give me the A!
- A!
- Give me the P!
- P!
- What that spell?
- Both: Wrap your dick!
Wrap up your dick!
Wrap your dick!
Wrap up your dick!
- Both: Hey, hey, you, you!
You need to get a clue!
Be safe, don't chafe!
Your dick will turn dark blue!
Uh-oh, she said,
my pussy's turning red!
- Ooh!
- Both: They'll burn when they
pee.
Protection is the key!
Safe sex!
- [laughing]
- Well, that was short.
[laughing]
- All: [laughing]
- Both: Ready?
Okay!
Always wear a condom,
and use a dental dam.
Abstinence is for boogers,
but we love our diaphragm!
- [laughing]
- A diaphragm?
- A what?
A diaphragm!
- A who?
- Both: You can use a diaphragm
with spermicidal lube!
Safe sex!
Whoooooo!
- All: [laughing]
- All right, kids.
We are gonna do us some runway.
First up,
Alexis and Avals Mateo.
Sisters in the name of love.
- Those outfits are to die for.
- Some birds did.
-<i> Me and Slava are walking</i>
<i>on that runway</i>
<i>like we are true divas.</i>
<i>He got my style,</i>
<i>he got my walk.</i>
<i>He got my signature move.</i>
-<i> Look at that bum!</i>
<i>Gorgeous.</i>
-<i> Unidentified flying asses.</i>
<i>Raja and her sister Enigma.</i>
-<i> Enigma, please.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
-<i> Ooh, girl!</i>
<i>It's the Cheetah Girls.</i>
<i>- It is!</i>
-<i> I know for a fact that</i>
<i>Chris is doing the best job</i>
<i>that he can.</i>
<i>And I hope that</i>
<i>the judges can see that.</i>
-<i> I think Enigma looks</i>
<i>very vulnerable.</i>
<i>Her face is vulnerable</i>
<i>but her</i><span style="bodyStyle"> legs</i><i> look like sailors.</i>
-<i> Up next, we have Yara</i>
<i>and Drewlita Sofia.</i>
<i>Goldfinger.</i>
-<i> This is real Mandrell sisters</i>
<i>realness.</i>
-<i> Yes.</i>
-<i> We are doing our catwalk,</i>
<i>and I feel so great.</i>
<i>He's doing everything</i>
<i>I taught him.</i>
-<i> Drewlita has that</i>
<i>"don't fuck with me" look</i>
<i>on her face.</i>
-<i> She does.</i>
-<i> I think it's real "Madonna</i>
<i>after yoga" look.</i>
-<i> It's Kabbalah Madonna.</i>
<i>Up next, Carmen and Lolita</i>
<i>Cruz-Carrera.</i>
-<i> Jujubee is back.</i>
-<i> We're walking down the runway</i>
<i>and he's serving it.</i>
<i>We're giving a lot of body</i>
<i>right now.</i>
<i>We're giving attitude.</i>
<i>We're giving pretty.</i>
<i>We're definitely representing</i>
<i>Carrera.</i>
-<i> This is just like</i>
<i>the Miss New Jersey Pageant.</i>
-<i> Representing Miss Patterson,</i>
<i>New Jersey.</i>
-<i> She sells sea shells</i>
<i>by the Jersey shore.</i>
<i>Last but not least,</i>
<i>the Luzon sisters.</i>
<i>Oh!</i>
-<i> Oh, snap it, Lagerfeld.</i>
-<i> Geisha to go.</i>
-<i> We're walking down the runway</i>
<i>just as we practiced.</i>
<i>Except that Matt is really</i>
<i>serving it fiercely.</i>
<i>He's truly a Luzon.</i>
-<i> I think it's murder</i>
<i>on the orient runway.</i>
-<i> I think it's more</i>
<i>Kill Bill 2.</i>
-<i> Kill Bill 2 meets To Wong Foo.</i>
-<i> Memoirs of a gay-sha.</i>
-<i> China dolls.</i>
- Welcome, sisters.
Thank you for giving us
something to cheer about.
Now it's time for
the judges' critique.
Let's start with Alexis
and Avals Mateo.
Hi, Avals.
Are you chilly up there?
- Chilly?
- Yeah, your nipples are hard.
- Oh, that's 'cause
I'm a little horny.
- [laughing]
- You really embraced
your feminine side.
You're really getting off on it,
aren't you?
- I really, really am.
- You've probably got a stiffy
going on under there somewhere.
- [laughing]
- I think that Alexis
did a great job on the makeup
and the hair.
- I think the cheer was sloppy
at points.
I think because you tried to put
too much into it.
- You have this
family resemblance
that's in the body,
it's in the face.
You were giving me Kardashian.
I'm keeping up with you.
- Next up, Raja
and her sister Enigma.
- We discovered that we both
have a mutual love
for old movies.
And we thought of maybe
a little bit more
of an old Hollywood glamour.
- What old movie
did you pattern her after?
<i>Tarzan?</i>
- It feels a little jungle.
It felt a little bit more like
<i>La Dolce Vita.</i>
- The walk, however.
It's a bit like a sailor.
- You know, I would
have expect Raja to instill
a little bit more of your
ability in Enigma.
- I thought the cheer
was quite athletic.
I can't remember what you were
cheering about though.
- Um, about bare backing.
- What does that mean?
- It means when you, um,
are fucking without condoms.
- Okay.
Well, that--see I've learned
something new today.
- Which we don't encourage,
we don't encourage.
- No, no, no, no.
Actually, I'm wearing a condom
right now.
- [laughing]
- Next up, we've got Yara Sofia
and her sister, Drewlita.
- Did she resist?
- Yes.
- What did she resist?
- Hair removal, tucking,
dancing, singing.
- So you resisted everything?
- Well, I'm historically
relatively shy.
So I'm just glad that I got out
here to try something new--
- But you have your sister now.
- Exactly.
- So you felt more outgoing once
you were walking the runway?
- Absolutely.
- I thought the cheer was quite
sweet.
You were, like,
fanning your bums.
- [laughing]
- Thank you.
- Well, you guys look amazing.
You look like Heart,
circa 1982,
you know, right when
they were going disco?
- You did such a beautiful job
giving Drewlita that sort of
Madonna face.
Which I think is fierce.
- And they both have man-hands,
just like Madonna.
- Yes.
- [laughing]
- Up next, Manila
and her drag sister Fuchsia.
- She's a true Luzon.
- Oh, really?
- Yes, this personality
is driving us nuts.
- You did an amazing job,
Manila, with the makeup.
Because the before and after
is just really incredible.
And Fuchsia, you seem to have
embraced the whole process.
- Hey!
- Hey!
- [laughing]
- I love this look.
Just giving me that perfect
Hong Kong garden restaurant...
I'm ready to order.
- [laughs]
- Would you date you?
- Yes. Hard.
- [laughing]
Up next, Carmen Carrera
and her sister, Lolita Cruz.
Do you feel pretty?
- Yes, absolutely.
I threw a little swagger into my
step be all right.
- Now Carmen, because
your sister is beefy,
very masculine,
did you ever consider maybe
doing something that sort of
feminized the body
a little bit more?
- You know, I don't care
what kind of body you have.
You know, you can be--
you can do naked.
If I was, you know,
100 pounds overweight,
I would still do my pasties
and get naked.
Because that's how much
confidence I have inside.
And I want to bring that out.
- From the head up,
there is some similarity.
It's just the arms the shoulders
that are still, like--
you know, like...
- [laughs]
You know, He-Man.
- You took care of yourself and
you're like, "Here, sister,
"try this on, girl.
Put this on.
You'll look fierce."
You're known for your body,
I know in your head you think
if you're 100 pounds heavier,
you'd still rock it.
I don't really buy that.
- Now sisters, while you enjoy
an Absolut cocktail
in the Interior Illusions
Lounge,
the judges and I
will deliberate.
You may leave the stage.
Just between us girls.
Let's start with Alexis
and Avels.
- They had a connection.
And I like that.
- The pro is, they did work
in synchronicity,
but I didn't understand
3/4 of it.
- Slava might have surpassed
Alexis.
- [laughing]
- Raja and Enigma.
- Raja is such a beauty.
And then you had this big,
strutting bloke.
- I didn't really feel
a sisterly connection.
It was more like a
mother-daughter kind of thing.
- I got, like,<i> Mommie Dearest</i>
in Christina.
Didn't you?
- Yes, I did.
- This is one of the bottom two
for me tonight.
- Yara Sofia and her sister
Drewlita.
- Love the outfits.
But I didn't think that there
was such a great connection.
- Drewlita, you know, is an
incredible transformation.
- Yeah, she was really pretty.
- I didn't really get a sibling
thing from them.
- Manila and her sister,
Fuschia.
They had a lot of fun with this.
- Mm.
- And Fuschia was a gas.
- Manila and him
were really good together.
You could tell that they were
enjoying each other.
- The biggest transformation
for me was Fuschia tonight.
Matt is a big ol' jock.
- Carmen and Lolita
Cruz-Carrera.
I don't know if she threw Lolita
under the bus.
Lolita's build was so stocky.
- It was more like
he was trying to help
his less attractive sister,
you know, get laid.
- Was Carmen meant
to dress down?
She has such a magnificent body
on her.
- And that made the awkwardness
of their bodies together
more pronounced.
- There are a million tricks up
Carmen's sleeve, you guys.
- Sure.
- Trust me.
She looked out for herself
all night.
- Silence!
I've made my decision.
Bring back the sisters.
Welcome back, ladies.
Now based on
your jock transformations,
and your presentations
on the main stage,
I've made some decisions.
Alexis Mateo.
- Wait, wait, shh.
- You were a real player
this week.
And I thought
I was seeing double.
Double-D.
You're safe.
- Thank you, guys.
- [exhales]
- Manila.
You served up two China dolls.
And 20 minutes later...
we're still hungry for more.
Condragulations.
You are this week's MVP,
and the winner
of this week's challenge.
- Yeah!
That's my girl!
- You've won a cruise for two
to the Bahamas.
Courtesy of alandchuck.travel.
And for helping you
with your win,
we are awarding your jock
the same prize.
- Oh, ho, ho!
Shit! Yeah!
I'm going on a cruise!
- Raja.
You were off your game.
And your sister act was
none the better for it.
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
- Ru tells me that I have to
lip-synch for my life.
I couldn't believe it.
- Yara Sofia.
You're safe.
Carmen Carrera.
Your look was a home run.
But you left your sister
sitting on the bench.
I'm sorry, but you are up
for elimination.
- I don't know what to feel
right now.
If I go home,
I'll be upset about it.
I'm just gonna be Carmen
and do what I do best.
I'm just gonna turn it out.
- Two queens stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me
to save yourself
from elimination.
The time has come
for you to lip-synch...
for your life.
Good luck.
And don't fuck It up.
-<i> I've worked so hard from day</i>
<i>one since I've been here</i>
<i>and I would hate to go home.</i>
<i>I had to muster up</i>
<i>all the</i><span style="bodyStyle"> fierceness</i>
I could find within me
and just go for it.
[cheers and applause]
- Raja's getting naked.
I'm, like, this is gonna be hot,
'cause Carmen is nudity,
and they're gonna thrown down
right now.
- Ooh!
- This is just soft porn.
It's kinda hot.
- Woo-hoo!
- Wow!
Ladies,
We've had 28 lip-synchs
for your life
and that was by far,
straight up,
the most surprising one eva!
I've made my decision.
Raja.
Shantay, you stay.
- [crying]
I'm glad to be here.
Thank you so much.
It's just an overwhelming
emotion
that comes over you.
And I'm thankful to Ru.
And I'm a very, very lucky
person.
And I just--you know what?
I'm just thankful.
- Carmen Carrera.
Baby, you don't make it easy
to say good-bye.
And you will be missed.
Now...
sashay away.
- Thank you.
- Love you, darling.
- Love you, darling.
- For real this time.
Don't come back, okay?
- [laughing]
- I feel honored that Ru
asked me to come back.
But if my time is up,
my time is up.
- To the final four.
Condragulations.
The race for the crown
has never been so close.
Now remember.
If you can't love yourself...
how in the hell are you gonna
love somebody else?
Can I get an amen in here?
- All: Amen!
- All right.
Now, let the music play!

-<i> Previously</i>
<i>on</i><span style="bodyStyle"> RuPaul's Drag Race...</i>
You will be designing
a couture dress
inspired by these cakes.
Ooh!
You need a 12-step program
to deal with that lava.
- The reality of it
is that she looked awful.
- I would like
to see Shangela go.
She's just a loudmouth,
and she's always halleluing.
- Shangela, get the fuck out.
- Raja.
You're the winner
of this challenge.
Alexis Mateo,
you're a sweet talker,
but your cheesecake couture
struck a sour note
with the judges.
Shante, you stay.
Stacy Layne Matthews,
sashay away.
<i>And tonight...</i>
break out your library cards.
Reading is fundamental.
- Ow!
Eat it, eat it, eat it, ow.
- And a comedy of errors.
- I said,
"Bitch better have my money."
- With extra special
guest judges
comediennes Rita Rudner
and Arden Myrin.
The winner of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i>
will receive
a lifetime supply
of Kryolan Professional makeup;
headline Logo's Drag Race Tour,
featuring cocktails
perfected by Absolut;
and a cash prize of $75,000.
And may the best woman win!
[car engines racing]
- Whoo-hoo.
It's so empty in here.
Hello.
[imitates echo]
Stacy is gone.
"Be a lady.
You're all amazing.
Stacy Layne 'Bryant' Matthews."
- The last challenge,
being in the bottom two,
I think it was a fluke.
So right now
I just have to concentrate
in what the judges
are looking for.
- Well, Stacy's gone.
Now you're the only big girl.
- Stacy probably shouldn't have
been here to begin with.
She didn't meet the criteria.
But now I have a whole other
can of worms to worry about.
For the most part, all the
strong competitors are here.
And it's really hammered in
that now
the competition is super tight.
At this point,
it's getting very personal.
- I wanted to ask you
about yesterday.
When you said you're so tired
of hearing my voice,
my reaction was,
like, I was shocked.
- It came off a lot harsher
than I intended.
- As I'm having this
conversation with Manila,
it's a complete 180
from what she was delivering
on the runway.
I know that Manila
has more faces
than my foot has blisters
after a show.
- And I don't want you to think
that I'm attacking you...
- No.
- But I am attacking you.
Because ultimately
this is a competition,
and I want to beat you.
[alarm wails]
- Ooh, girl.
You've got shemail.
Hello, lady-boys.
- Hi.
- Drag is a serious business,
but sometimes a queen can take
herself a little too seriously.
Remember, laugh, and the world
laughs with you.
Bomb, and the joke's on you,
honey.
- Whoo!
Yeah.
- Hello, hello, hello.
- Hello.
- My legendary children.
A drag superstar needs to
develop a pretty thick skin.
So in the great tradition
of<i> Paris Is Burning,</i>
break out your library cards.
- Oh, god.
- Because reading is what?
Fundamental.
Now, for today's mini challenge,
you'll take turns
reading each other.
Or throwing shade.
Ladies, the library is open,
okay?
- Okay.
- Yara Sofia.
<i>La biblioteca</i><span style="bodyStyle"> is open.</i>
Put on your reading glasses
and read these bitches
for filth.
- Manila Luzon.
It's not because you're Asian.
It's because I need some
patience to deal with you.
Delta Work, is that your tits
or your feet?
- Oh!
- Raja,
you think you're fashion?
You should go to old...school.
- Next up, Manila.
- Ow, eat it, eat it, eat it.
Ow!
- Put on your reading glasses.
- Oh, god.
- Ooh, Yara.
Your blue contacts are so creepy
that it makes my skin itchy,
itchy, itchy...pa'lante.
- Oh!
- It's dinner time, Delta.
And you are serving
body-ody-ody.
Well, I guess
that solves the problem
with all them starving kids
in Africa.
- Thank you, Manila.
Up next is Miss Delta.
- Oh, my gosh.
Yara, isn't it interesting
that when your flight
came into town
the sightings of chupacabras
increased?
[laughter]
Manila, what are we gonna do
when the hurricane
hits all of Asia.
You won't have
any material left.
- Uh-oh. Uh-oh.
- Raja,
when you're on the runway,
do you keep the 800 number
for suicide?
Because those toes
are ready to jump.
- Whoa!
- Bring your library card,
Miss Alexis Mateo.
- Get ready, bitches.
Miss Shangela, girl,
can we have some water?
Her hair is thirsty, baby.
- Uh-oh.
- Delta, just grow a neck,
honey.
- Whoa!
- All they can read is my size,
and that's so obvious.
Now tell me something funny.
- Raja, should I call you Raja
or grandma?
- Ooh!
- Oh!
- Raja, you are up.
- Shangela,
I hope you still have
your phone card to Middle-earth,
'cause the hobbits are calling.
- Ooh!
- Fat.
Who cares?
Syphilis.
[laughter]
- Carmen, the library
is open to you, my dear.
- Word.
- Yara, what the fuck are you
saying, girl?
- Alexis, girl, I been thinking
about you all day.
I was at the zoo.
- Ooh!
- All right, last but not least,
Shangela.
Yes.
- Oh.
Mimi Imfurst.
[laughter]
Raja, I know you call yourself
Top Model,
but I think Tyra Banks and I
would agree
you're just fashion roadkill.
- Ooh!
- Manila Luzon,
Asian role model.
Well, I hope you're referring to
the rolls all over your body.
- Ooh!
- And, aw, Carmen Carrera.
Honey, just go
jump in the ocean.
You won't drown.
Silicone floats.
- All right, girl.
The library
is permanently closed.
All right, ladies, good job.
But I think we have a winner.
Shangela!
For this week's main challenge,
you need to develop
a stand-up comedy routine.
To help you create
a winning routine,
you'll each take
a one-on-one comedy workshop
with legendary funny lady
Miss Rita Rudner.
- Oh, wow.
- Oh, my god, Rita!
I can't wait to meet
Rita Rudner!
- Now, for your
stand-up performance,
you'll need to put together
a funny outfit
worthy of a queen of comedy.
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the funniest bitch win.
- All right.
See y'all later.
- Oh, my.
Yes, I am a little terrified.
My heart stopped, actually,
when she said that.
It's frightening,
'cause I'm just hoping
that I don't bomb,
and that happens a lot
with comedians.
If you don't have
the perfect timing,
you could really fuck it up.
Shangela's an amazing comedian.
She's been doing it for a while,
so I'm sure she's gonna do
really well in this one.
- Well, damn sure I was right
when I said,
"I want that bitch to go."
- Well, no, because comedy
is hit or miss.
It's a lot of pressure.
- We all kind of
have to be good,
the three of us, because their
group's still the same size.
Our group is getting smaller.
- It's like our workroom
is now divided into two groups.
We got team talent
and team look.
Raja, Delta, Carmen, and Manila
all put the emphasis
on their look.
They can't perform.
- Today we have to do
a stand-up routine,
and we have to create
a drag look
that goes with
our stand-up routine.
- I'm gonna have to do some
brainstorming here.
- Well, that's gonna be hard.
You see what time she's having
with it.
The workroom today
is very quiet.
There's no sewing.
Everyone is digging
deep inside their brains,
trying to find
what about themselves is funny.
- I'm--I'm afraid.
- You can't be afraid.
You got to go in or go home.
- It's hard
to make people laugh,
but I'm gonna do it.
I'm so funny.
Funny enough
that you gonna laugh.
- A lot of people here
host a show,
so everyone here is gonna be
strong competition,
and that's, like,
when they tell me that
my makeup's not the best,
you know, it's important to me
to look--
have the look right.
When I get
in front of the judges,
it's never a question
about talent.
It's always something
regarding my makeup.
- The purpose for the makeup
is not to look...painted.
- What about when I'm doing here
and sculpting the face?
You know how you talk about
a round face?
- From here up, I don't use
a lot of foundation.
I don't need it there.
- Oh, it's not even
all the way across?
- No.
- No.
Because then you're
creating a mask.
Everything that Shangela said
is exactly
what you never should do.
- You don't put on powder
between steps?
- No! No!
[laughter]
How do you--no, no.
- Hello, funny ladies.
- Hi.
- Funny girls.
Hey, Carmen.
- Hey, hey.
- Now, you're obviously
from New Jersey.
You have sort of
a Jersey accent.
- Do I?
- Yeah, you do.
Are you gonna play up sort of
the stereotypical things
that people may think of you?
- No, I'm not typical Jersey.
So...
- How do you know you're not
typical Jersey?
- I don't think I am.
I don't see it.
Am I that Jersey?
Like, what does that mean?
I mean, is that an insult?
- A lot of comedy
comes from stereotypes,
and if you play on that,
it can be very funny.
People can relate to it.
Because, really, you want to
invite people into your world
and make them feel comfortable.
But it's up to you whether
you're willing to let us in.
- I don't really like
to let anyone in.
- Well, you got to
get over that.
Hey, Manila.
- Hi.
- You know, this seems like
a shoo-in for you.
You're very funny.
- I'm going back
to my childhood.
As an adult looking back,
how gay some of the things
I used to watch on TV were.
<i>Sesame Street?</i>
- Right, right.
So now, in the past,
I've heard jokes
about<i> Sesame Street.</i>
- Um, maybe.
I don't really know.
- I want to hear something
that we haven't heard before.
Get back to work.
- Thanks.
- See ya.
Hey, Alexis.
- Hi, Ru.
- Have you done comedy before?
- No, we have never
do stand-up comedy.
- I see.
And you're gonna tell
some jokes?
- Yes.
- As Alexis, or as a character?
- As Alexis Mateo.
And it's gonna talk about
my coming to America experience.
It was a big change.
It was the problem
with the language.
- No one else
has your life experience,
so if you draw on that,
how could you go wrong?
Especially if you can
laugh at yourself.
- I love making fun of myself.
- I am so excited.
I can't wait to laugh,
laugh, laugh.
- Thank you for stopping
by my office.
- All right.
- Bye, Ru.
- Bye.
Hey, Delta.
- Hi, Ru.
- I have a feeling
you're gonna be very funny.
- Um, I am.
- They say that comedy comes
from, you know, a dark place,
and I have a feeling that
you've spent a lot of time
where, uh,
maybe people have said
some nasty things to you,
and you've had a lot of time
to think about getting back
at them.
Am I right?
- Yes, that's very true.
But I don't want it to seem
like,
"Poor me, poor me, poor me."
I want it to be like, "Poor me,
pour me another one."
I'm so excited.
I think if I'm clear
and concise about the jokes,
I think that I could win.
- I can't wait.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
All right, ladykins.
Gather around.
In a moment you'll meet
with guest judge Rita Rudner,
who will help you with your
chutzpah, uniqueness,
nerve, and talent.
Now, Shangela, since you
won the mini challenge,
you get an extra ten minutes
with Rita Rudner.
Plus you get to choose
the order of the lineup.
- This is where the real shade
is gonna happen.
- Now, tomorrow,
on the main stage,
we'll be joined by guest judge,
the sassy comedian from
<i>Chelsea Lately</i><span style="bodyStyle"> and</i><i> Mad TV,</i>
Arden Myrin.
- Whoo!
- Oh, and one more thing.
You'll be performing
your stand-up
in front of the harshest critics
of all--
a live audience.
So don't fuck it up.
I'll see you later.
- All right, bye.
- I work in front of
an audience at my shows.
It's the best place
to get energy.
The problem is sometimes
that energy is good,
and sometimes it's bad.
- You guys want to come over,
'cause I got the order of
the show set up for tomorrow.
- Okay.
- I know how it is to work
at a club.
When you go to work
at a drag show,
they usually put the girls
who they don't like
in the beginning.
- Opening the show's
gonna be Raja.
She's, what we call
in the comedy world,
biting the bullet.
And then Carmen, Alexis.
I put Carmen second.
If she's great, she follows Raja
and makes Raja look horrible.
Alexis, you'll introduce me,
and then I'll introduce Manila.
Then Yara and Delta,
you'll close the show, okay?
I put Manila directly after me.
If she's intimidated by me,
let her be
really intimidated by me.
- Why did you put me in the...
before the last one?
- I know you probably
wanted to be
toward the end of the show,
but I don't want you
to be the last one.
Yara wants to go last,
but I put her next to last.
If she knocks it
out of the park,
that puts Delta
at a disadvantage,
because then she has to
close the show
and go after Yara.
- If the intention
is to fuck with people,
it's not gonna work.
This is my make it moment,
because this is what I do
for a living, and...
- Yeah.
- Is entertain people
on the microphone.
- What do you think
about the order?
- I think it's a setup.
- For you, like, if I were to go
right after Shangela,
I'd be a little bit nervous.
- If I go out there and bomb,
it's gonna be like,
"Oh, fuck."
- They should have never told me
they saw me as a threat.
I will see each one of them
go home.
- Hi, Manila.
I'm Rita.
- Hi, Rita.
I'm a huge fan.
Rita Rudner is going to be
giving us stand-up advice.
She's one of the funniest people
in show business.
- And what are you going to do
for us today?
- Looking back at
some of the PBS programming
that I used to watch
and how gay
it actually seems now.
- Let's hear you
do the first joke.
- So looking back at Mr. Rogers,
I don't know
if he was on the down-low,
because he had a second house.
And every show started out
with a costume change.
Comedy's hard.
I'm just nervous that, like,
other people's routines
are gonna be,
like, so much funnier than mine.
- My life is funny.
- And now tell us
some of the funny things.
- I am from Puerto Rico.
Since I was just a little girl.
You know.
- That's funny.
- [clicks tongue]
I went all the way to Florida.
- Maybe let's make a joke
about that.
You say, "I came to Miami.
"I was in first class.
I was in the front of the raft."
- I was in the--in the what?
- In the front of the raft.
- In the raft?
- Yes, that's a raft.
- Girl, I don't know
if I can pronounce that.
- My, um, act is gonna be based
on the film<i> Carrie.</i>
- I haven't seen<i> Carrie</i>
in 40 years.
I always worry about
a specific movie reference.
If no one has seen, uh,
the movie, she is in trouble.
- And my outfit that
I'm wearing, actually,
it's sort of this
blood-drenched,
like, you know, gown.
- You come in--"Did anyone else
just get their period?"
- See, I wanted to do
a period joke.
Anybody else get their period?
- "Did anyone else<i> just</i><span style="bodyStyle"> get."</i>
-<i> "Just</i><span style="bodyStyle"> get their per..."</i>
So did anyone else
just get their period?
- But stay still
while you're doing it.
- Anyone else
just get their period?
- There you go.
I laughed.
- So I think what I do is
I want to kind of start out
by maybe
I should drop some weight.
- Good.
- And basically, like, that's
kind of what it's about.
A fat chick's like a unicycle.
Every guy wants to be with one.
They want to take one on a ride.
They just don't want to be seen
doing it.
Ultimately, I think what I want
to do is maybe not, like, love,
and maybe not just, like,
a one-night stand.
I think what it is is I just
want to sit on a guy's face.
- You're not really talking
about how to lose weight.
- Right.
- You know, you have to decide
what it is that you're going to
talk about.
- I'm a post-modern pimp ho.
I've never performed
as a character
on the stage other than myself.
- You've got it right away.
When you come out and say, "Yo,
you know, bitch..."
you've got that--
you've got the character
perfectly right there.
- Great.
But I'm feeling more pressure,
and definitely a little nervous.
You always want to shine,
especially when people think
it's what you do.
- Hi.
- Hello, Yara.
- Hi.
I'm supposed to be
a little person.
- Right.
- Yes, I want to make a story.
This girl from Spain.
It's hard to live here
in States,
and I miss the guy.
This gorgeous guy.
And I follow him.
You know, I'm a little person,
and I have to poop.
[imitates flatulence]
Get out, get out,<i> cabron.</i>
Get out, get out, get out,
<i>cabron.</i>
Get out, get out, get out.
- That is the most unusual act
I've ever seen.
- Oh.
It's so weird hearing my voice.
- Now, Carmen, are you doing,
um, something personal about you
or other people?
- Haven't really pieced together
what I'm gonna do yet.
- Just say some things you have
on that lovely sheet of paper.
- Um...
- Come on.
You have to say something
in the mic,
otherwise we can't help.
- Okay, well,
I'll see you tomorrow.
- You silly boy.
Come over here.
- Like, I just have, like,
a bunch of topics that I...
- Okay, what are some more
of your topics?
- Okay, I'm the only queen
that's really here
from new Jersey,
and I don't look at myself
in the mirror
and see a stereotypical
new Jersey person.
- So did you always
feel out of place?
- Never.
- But you should,
because that's gonna be funny.
There's nothing funny about
a good-looking person
doing well,
who's confident.
So think of something that
you're insecure about,
and share it with us.
- Let's see...mm...
- I didn't understand where
her humor was going to
come from,
so I'm gonna worry about Carmen
tonight.
- [alarm beeps]
-<i> Buenos dias.</i>
- Let the funny come out.
- We're back
in the workroom today,
and the challenge this week
is to come up with a hilarious
outfit for the runway
and then perform
a stand-up routine
for a live audience.
- She sounds like--like a goat.
- Girl, I got to learn
this thing by memory.
It's so loud in here, it's still
hard to commit stuff to memory
when everyone's talking,
you know.
- [moans]
- [sighs]
- Delta's a little bit shaken
at this point,
because this is a
really high-pressure challenge.
She's struggling, and I really,
really feel for her.
- I'm terrified,
and I'm scared as shit.
I'm so worried, you know?
- Relax.
Don't stress.
We got this.
We're the Heathers.
- Yep.
- We're the Heathers.
- We're the Heathers.
- Yes.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, babe.
Your face looks so much better.
- 'Cause I'm gonna be a clown,
'cause I'm gonna be hilarious!
- Before, you was painted like
a motherfuckin' ghost, honey.
- Why are you making fun of me
so hard?
I just want to be a fierce
drag queen like the next girl.
- Hey, Manila,
are you going to speak
in, like, your Asian accent?
- Are you gonna speak
with an Espanol accent?
- I can't help it.
[laughter]
- You know what you should do?
You should do
that British accent
you were so successful at.
- Fuck you.
- So funny to me.
- Isn't it funny?
- It is funny.
- Manila told Ru that
she's so tired of my mouth.
But you'll never
see her shut up.
I don't even think
she takes air.
- Okay?
This show is gonna start out
with a bang.
- I see Carmen in her fat suit.
It's just--it's so too much.
It's so weird.
I was like, "Really, girl?
This is what you're gonna do?"
- Bitch, and I want to
lay on it, honey.
- I know that everyone is,
like, "Oh, well, Carmen.
I'm worried about Carmen."
My mentality is,
this is going to work.
- She just signed the paper.
She's on her way home.
[laughter]
[upbeat music]
Hey, guys.
Welcome to the main stage
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
Michelle,
how is your funny bone?
- Oh, being tickled
as we speak.
- Hey, Billy B.
Are you related to Celine Dion?
- No.
- Then why the long face?
[laughter]
Rita Rudner.
Thank you for giving my girls
a master class in comedy.
- I was very impressed,
and I think
it's going to be a lot of fun.
I can't wait.
- Arden Myrin.
- Hi.
- I hope you're wearing
your iPad,
because the fun
is about to flow, girl.
- I never go anywhere
without it.
- [laughter]
For this week's main challenge,
we asked our girls
to make us laugh out loud
with their own
stand-up routines.
Tonight,
headlining on the main stage,
let's welcome RuPaul's
drag queens of comedy.
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.
[cheers and applause]
- Hello.
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.
Anybody else on their period?
You know, I'm a little bit into
the horror movies.
Can you guess which one?
<i>Carrie,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> yes.</i>
How many people have seen
<i>Carrie,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> actually?</i>
Well, see, good, good.
The real special thing
about Carrie
is that she has
telekinetic powers.
Telekinesis means that you can
move things with your mind.
The last time I moved anything
with my head,
it was in a motel room.
The john threw $40
on my come-slick tits
and told me
to get the fuck out.
I was like,
"I'm leaving, fucker,
I'm leaving."
Good god.
You ain't got to yell at me
like that.
I'll see you at home, dad.
[laughter]
- I'm a drag queen.
When you first start doing drag,
it's, like, you want to be
the fishiest.
You want to have the best body.
But now I want to be a fat girl.
I want to be a fat girl.
You can get dick
from anywhere.
Every guy wants to secretly
fuck a fat bitch, number one.
So I'm not gonna have
no man problems, okay?
I want to be, like, really fat.
I want to get pregnant
and not even know it.
[laughter]
You know, have you seen those
specials on TV?
And it's usually a big girl.
It's, like,
of course she didn't know
she was fuckin' pregnant.
You know what I mean?
I want to go to the bathroom,
sit on the toilet, and become a
mother, okay?
No matter what size I am,
I will be the body beautiful.
Always, okay?
You want to see?
A little preview?
[cheers and applause]
And I will still [bleep]
turn it, darling.
Always.
- Whoo!
Yes, bitches!
It is not Angelina Jolie.
It is not Beyoncé.
It is your girl, Alexis,
all the way from Puerto Rico!
[speaking Spanish]
Yes, ma'am, honey!
And I am so excited,
because I always wanted to be
a star, honey,
so I left Puerto Rico behind,
and I moved to united states,
all the way to Florida.
I did travel in first class.
Right in front of that boat,
baby.
Honey, I'm a Latina girl,
and I only have two options
in this country--
being a housekeeper
or being a stripper, bitches.
And you all know I didn't came
here to clean toilets, baby,
so I became a stripper, baby!
Yes, ma'am, honey.
If god give it to you, baby,
you better make some money.
Yes, ma'am.
I am here and I'm queer, baby.
- Mm-hmm.
I said, "Bitch
better have my money."
Right?
Let me tell you something, baby.
They call me Laquifa.
Laquifa the P.M.P.
Now, that stands for
the post-modern pimp ho.
Post-modern pimp ho means, yes,
I'm still a pimp,
but I'm also my own ho.
That's right.
'Cause of the recession, y'all,
I'm telling you,
I done had to scale back.
You know, and sometimes I don't
even pay myself my own money.
Uh-huh.
If I did, maybe
I could get some shoes
where my toes wasn't hanging
five inches off the edge.
Yeah.
I know you tried to clown me
for my cliffhangers.
Yeah, I saw it.
You know, they always try
to clown me on the block, baby.
They always saying, "Laquifa!"
I say, "What?"
They say, "Laquifa,
where your hoes at?"
I said, "Bitch, don't you see
"I'm wearing four pair of hose
right here,
holding back my dick?"
Ugh!
Boy, you know,
I had a dumbass girlfriend
that went and joined PETA?
She came screaming at me
last week
talking about, "Laquifa!"
I said, "What?"
She said, "Laquifa,
don't you know
how many innocent animals
had to die
for you to have that fur coat?"
I said, "Bitch,
do you know how many
rich animals I had to fuck
to get this coat?"
Stupid bitch.
- Hi, everyone.
My parents weren't really big
about the TV.
I really only had, like,
PBS and<i> Sesame Street.</i>
Sesame Street
was one gay-ass block.
Okay, obviously we have
Bert and Ernie.
I mean, they're so gay,
they practically
are board members of GLAAD.
Um, now,
one of my favorite people
that lives on Sesame Street
is the Count.
He's one of those old,
Liberace gays,
and he loves
collecting tchotchkes,
like Faberge eggs.
[imitating Count]
One Faberge egg,
two Faberge egg,
three Faberge egg.
Ah, ah, ah.
- Whoo!
- Hi, I'm Yara Sofia.
I'm gonna make
a long story short.
I met a guy in a club,
and he took me
to wonder restaurant
he call McDonald's.
"You want chicken sandwich?"
I go, "What the hell
is chicken?"
She told me,
"Chicken means pollo."
Pollo means
"cock" in Spain!
So I don't want to eat
a fucking dick sandwich.
After that, he took me
to the apartment,
and he took her clothes off.
"Oh, my god,
what the hell is that?"
He was huge.
The difference between an onion
and a 14-inch dick,
both makes me cry.
[laughter]
[imitates flatulence]
Get out, get out, get out,
get out, get out!
Get out, get out,<i> cabron.</i>
There was shit
all over the bed.
I felt like a Willy Wonka
Chocolate Factory.
[cheers and applause]
- My name's Delta Work.
I'm in my early to early 30s,
and, um, I'm here in southern
California
just kind of looking for love,
you know,
and it's kind of hard
for a big girl like me,
because it's so
body-conscious in L.A.,
and it freaks me out to think--
who is gonna want
a girl like me?
What?
Is that funny?
Like, I see these stories
about these girls
that they go out running
and then they get,
like, abducted and assaulted,
and, you know, it's, like,
I have to eat frozen burritos.
I have to watch the marathon
of<i> Hoarders.</i>
Because if I go out
and exercise,
I'm gonna get raped.
You guys have been
an amazing audience.
Thank you so much
for coming out.
We appreciate you coming out.
- Welcome back, ladies.
It's time for
the judges' critiques.
Let's start with Raja.
How'd you feel out there?
- [exhales noisily]
I'm so glad that's over.
It was really challenging.
- What I loved
about your performance
was that you had a topper
of your topper line
when you said the dad.
- Yeah.
- When did you think of that?
- Today.
- Today.
It was good.
The makeup is flawless.
I could go on and on, but wow.
Your face is by far the most
beautiful you've ever looked.
- I notice you had a lot of
setup;
not a lot of punch lines.
- Overall, I thought
you did a great job,
and it's not easy to go first,
and you look...
- Next up, Carmen Carrera.
- Hey, guys.
- You didn't share your act
with Rita yesterday.
Was that a strategy you had?
- No, not at all.
My way of thinking
is very weird.
Some people, I guess,
think that I might be,
like, not paying attention
and not focusing,
but I'm always in my head.
- How is your head?
- My head is good.
- Haven't had any complaints
yet.
[laughter]
- Rita, what'd you think?
- Well, I was so proud of you.
I couldn't figure out where
the jokes were gonna come from,
and you figured it out.
- I thought that you were pretty
and you relied on that,
so that performance completely
changed my opinion of you.
- I love the hair and the
outfit.
It's like Wonder Woman meets my
favorite shag rug.
If you can be beautiful and
funny, there's your super power.
- I thought you were gonna suck.
Honest to god.
I am so proud of you tonight.
- Thank you.
- Hey, Carmen, are you actually
wearing anything
underneath that jacket?
- I kind of wanted to
show you guys my real body.
- [laughs]
If I looked like that,
I would never
take that outfit off
or put clothes on.
- Thank you, Carmen.
Up next, Alexis Mateo.
- I loved your reveal,
and they are big.
There's "a", "b", "c",
and Volkswagens.
I think maybe you relied
a little bit too much
on the visual gag.
- In radio,
you call it a crutch.
It's when you repeat something
over and over
'cause you don't know
what to say.
In Alexis' case it was "honey."
"Listen, honey.
"Let me tell you something,
honey.
No, honey.
Honey, honey, honey."
but be aware of those crutches.
- All right, Alexis.
Thank you.
Shangela Laquifa Wadley.
The pimptress.
- All right.
- I loved your concept.
It was so strong.
You kept on that theme.
And there was absolutely
no dead air.
- I just felt like people
were really with you,
and we felt like we
were in the hands of a pro.
- You look better tonight
than I've ever seen you look.
- You blended,
and I see the major difference.
- Thank you.
- So kudos to you, Shangela.
- I think that
that act and your talent
is money in the bank.
- Next up, Manila.
Now, the<i> Sesame Street</i><span style="bodyStyle"> jokes</i>
were very funny.
Did you think of those, or had
you heard them somewhere else?
- No, I just kind of, like,
quick made it up.
I mean, maybe someone else
suspects it too?
- I think the audience
took a beat to get to know you.
And especially
following Laquifa.
You know, you had to really
readjust the whole energy
of the audience.
- The content that you had
for the jokes
and what they were based on,
some of them were lost
because when we were
sort of laughing,
you were onto the other one.
- Were you nervous?
- I kind of was.
- You did feel the most
rehearsed of everybody.
Like, maybe in a stiffer way.
- Everything about you visually
is right on point tonight,
Manila.
But I feel like I've heard
a lot of those jokes before.
I mean, the Bert and Ernie joke,
let's be honest.
Everybody has been telling that.
- Up next, Yara Sofia.
- Yes!
Yes!
- What was
your character's name?
- Blara.
I have a friend
that is a little person,
and he pushed me to do it.
- And he would not be offended
by this at all?
- No.
I did it with the respect.
This is the stand-up comedy
that comedians do
in Puerto Rico.
- I was wondering if
it was going to be too graphic,
but I knew your energy
would take care of it,
and we loved watching you.
- I don't know
what you talked about,
except chicken and some shit.
- I have to say,
I love the character,
and your capacity
to stay on your knees
could earn you a lot of money
somewhere.
- Up next, we've got Delta Work.
You seemed a little bit nervous.
- I loved the beginning,
but at the end,
we kind of went a bit of
a distance without a laugh.
- I did notice going off-track
of what I thought
I was gonna do,
and I guess in some--
somewhere in my mind,
I thought
that was being organic.
- It started off sort of strong.
It felt very defined.
And then, I feel like
maybe you lost your way.
And then I felt like
there wasn't a payoff.
- Just remember, when
you're portraying a character,
you got to go
all the way with it.
So pump it up.
Get out of your head.
- Okay.
- All right, ladies,
I think we've heard enough.
Now, while you all
enjoy an Absolut cocktail
in the Interior Illusions
Lounge,
the judges and I
will deliberate.
You may leave the stage.
[car engine starts]
- Just between us girls,
let's start with Raja.
- First of all, I love the
bucket of blood on her head.
She didn't really go inward
for her comedy.
- We didn't get to know
anything more about Raja.
- Had she incorporated
or paralleled
her own story
with Carrie's story,
it would have been funny.
Let's talk about Carmen Carrera.
- She was the one
I was worried about.
She didn't tell me one joke.
And she thought about it
and came back with it.
I was so impressed.
- Tonight she did
a great performance.
I was very happy to see
that personality come out.
- Honey, Alexis Mateo.
I was a little disappointed
that she rushed through it.
She didn't let her routine
breathe.
- It just seemed
super amateur to me.
- I liked her physicality.
She had some fun dance moves,
but I don't remember her act.
- Shangela.
She was very confident
and comfortable on the stage.
- What she had was a character
I've never seen before,
and she has a catchphrase
that I want to hear
over and over.
- To me, as a stand-up,
the audience wants to know
that they're in good hands.
With Laquifa, we wanted to go
along on the ride.
- Her makeup was a lot better
tonight too.
- It really was.
- I think she did a good job.
- Manila Luzon.
A lot of people
recognized her routine.
Or it just felt very familiar.
- I do think
she added some things
that I'd never heard of,
like Mr. Rogers and the mailman.
I've never heard that.
But it didn't seem fresh.
- Yara Sofia.
That bitch was crazy.
She reminded me of Andy Kaufman,
who did things that sort of
just freaked people out,
but they still laughed.
- I always say, when you do
something, do it 110%.
- Mm-hmm.
- And I think she did it 120%.
- I felt like it could be at,
like, the Whitney Museum as,
like, a performance.
- The Whitney and Bobby Museum.
- [laughs]
- Delta Work.
- It started out good,
and then it just went
all over the place.
- It was kind of dark,
wasn't it?
- And it was a bit sad.
- She's thinking way too much
about everything that she says.
She's got a constant sadness
around her.
- All right, silence!
I've made my decision.
Send in the clowns.
- Welcome back, ladies.
Now, based on your ability
to tickle our funny bones,
I've made some decisions.
Alexis Mateo,
you're safe.
- Thank you.
- Raja...
bloody well done.
You are safe.
- Thank you.
- Manila, your presentation
was stiff.
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
- When Ru says I'm in the bottom
two, I'm in shock.
At this point in the game,
like, where we're all so good,
like, any little fuck-up
is now magnified.
- Shangela,
as a post-modern pimp,
you bitch-slapped
the competition.
Condragulations.
You are the winner
of this challenge.
[applause]
You've won an original
custom-designed gown
from Miami Elite Designs.
- Hallelu.
[laughter]
I'm almost speechless,
and the judges' response to me
makes me just feel like
I'm going
in the right direction.
Thank you.
- Yara Sofia, you're safe.
You may join the other girls.
- Aah!
[laughter]
- Carmen Carrera, you're safe.
Delta Work, my dear.
This week, you lost your way.
I'm sorry, but you are
up for elimination.
- Okay.
I'm pissed off because this
should be my first time
in the bottom.
This shouldn't be my third time
in the bottom.
- Two queens stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me
and to save yourself
from elimination.
- Oh, my god.
I don't want Delta to go.
- The time has come
for you to lip-synch
for your life.
Good luck, and don't fuck it up.
[intro to<i> Macarthur Park</i><span style="bodyStyle"> plays]</i>
- [laughs]
- I'm looking at Manila,
and I'm going, "Wow.
This is Broadway."
[cheers and applause]
- Whoo!
- Yeah!
[applause]
- That is what a lip-synch
for your life
is all about.
Now, I have made my decision.
Manila, shante, you stay.
- Thank you for everything
you've given me.
I love you.
[crying]
- Fuck.
- Delta, you are a great queen,
and this experience
will propel you
into a phase where you can trust
your god-given instinct.
You know what?
I love you.
I adore you.
- Thank you.
- Now, sashay away.
- Thank you very much.
[applause]
- I'm gonna miss you.
- [crying]
- I took some risks.
Um, it didn't work in this case,
but I'm not disappointed
in myself.
I'm so happy
to have made it this far,
and I'm just glad
to have lost to a Heather,
not to one of the boogers.
- Condragulations, girls.
You are all one step closer to
becoming America's next
drag superstar.
And remember,
if you can't love yourself,
how in the hell are you gonna
love somebody else?
Can I get an amen in here?
all: Amen!
- All right,
now let the music play.
[upbeat music plays]
Grand prize contributed in part
by AlandChuck.travel.


- Previously on
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race...</i>
May the funniest bitch win.
- It's like our workroom is now
divided into two groups.
We got team talent
and team look.
I will see each one of them
go home.
- Whoo!
- Anybody else on their period?
- Mm-hmm, I said bitch better
have my money!
- Pfffft!
Get out, get out, get out,
get out!
- That bitch was crazy.
Shangela, you bitch-slapped
the competition.
Con-drag-ulations.
You are the winner of this
challenge.
[cheers and applause]
That is what a lip sync for your
life is all about.
Manila...
shante, you stay.
Delta...
sashay away.
-<i> I'm just glad to have lost</i>
<i>to a Heather,</i>
not to one of the boogers.
-<i> And tonight...</i>
I'm so excited,
I'm lactating.
<i>Fierce flies.</i>
- [imitates gunfire]
-<i> And a star-spangled salute...</i>
- Bam!
-<i> With extra special guest</i>
<i>judges</i>
<i>Cheryl Tiegs</i>
<i>and Johnny Weir.</i>
<i>The winner of</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
RuPaul's Drag Race
<i>will receive a lifetime supply</i>
<i>of Kryolan professional makeup,</i>
<i>headline Logo's</i><span style="bodyStyle"> Drag Race</i><i> tour,</i>
<i>featuring cocktails perfected</i>
<i>by Absolut,</i>
<i>and a cash prize of $75,000.</i>
And may the best woman win.
- Yoo-hoo!
Toughest queens coming through.
-<i> So we're back in the workroom,</i>
<i>and there's Delta's message,</i>
and it's pretty
heartbreaking for me, because
Delta and I are so close.
- I can't believe I sent
Heather home.
Delta's gone.
We're missing one Heather.
<i>It's sad, but I haven't had</i>
<i>such a rush in my life before.</i>
<i>When I was lip-syncing</i>
<i>last week,</i>
<i>I was living onstage.</i>
<i>It's really put in a new energy</i>
<i>into how I'm playing this</i>
<i>competition.</i>
- Delta was so fetch.
- She was fetch.
- Heather, stop trying to make
"fetch" work.
It's not happening.
- What is the hell with this
"Heathers" group?
<i>I think Carmen is fake.</i>
<i>I think Raja is fake.</i>
<i>I think Manila is fake.</i>
Bam.
- Oh, I love you, Delta.
- You sent her home.
- Well, bitch, it was her or me,
honey.
- See you at the bathhouse,
girl.
- What'd you think about how,
you know, everyone was so sad
when Delta left and went up and
gave that big old hug
and that teary good-bye
and that production?
- It was exactly that,
a production.
It was a "we are the world,
we are the children" moment
on the stage.
- Let's stay strong in this
competition, okay?
- All right.
[siren wails]
- Oh!
- Ooh, girl!
<i>You got she mail.</i>
Hey, racers.
all: Hello.
- I have dragged my ass all
around this world,
and I've learned one thing--
the U.S.A. is still the best
damn country on earth.
- Yes.
- Whoo!
- My fellow drag Americans,
ask not what<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i>
can do for you.
Ask what you can do for
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
[laughs]
- Yeah!
- Whoo!
- Hello, hello, hello.
all: Whoa!
- Well, howdy, partners.
This week, we're gonna focus on
two of my favorite things--
"t" and "a."
You want to know what the "t"
is?
all: Yes!
- All right.
<i>For today's mini challenge,</i>
<i>I want you to turn these plain</i>
<i>brassieres</i>
<i>into something</i>
<i>truly glamorific.</i>
I want you to bedazzle a healthy
pair of hooters.
- Ooh! Yes!
- Yes!
- The queen with the most
bedazzling bra wins.
Now, you have 30 minutes,
so ready, set...
Go!
[frantic percussion]
- Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop.
Yes!
- Oh, fuck that asshole!
[humming]
- Really? Is that, like,
actually part of the challenge?
Deal with you?
-<i> Aah!</i>
<i>Oh, girl, look.</i>
<i>The bra--that's the wrong side.</i>
- No, you didn't.
- My initial idea is to do kind
of a modern replica
<i>of RuPaul's face on the bra.</i>
Now, that is couture.
- All right, ladies,
time's up.
<i>Gather round.</i>
<i>Wow.</i>
I'm so excited, I'm lactating.
First up, Alexis Mateo.
Careful, girl.
You could put somebody's eyes
out with those things.
<i>Bam!</i>
- [laughs]
- Beautiful.
Thank you, Alexis.
- Thank you.
-<i> Next up, Yara Sofia.</i>
Wow.
- This is my ze-bra collection.
-<i> Ah, your ze-bra.</i>
- By Yara Sofia's Secret.
- Hunty.
Next up, Shangela.
- [humming sultry music]
- Ooh.
Now, is that corn?
- Actually, this is supposed to
be a model of you.
- Uh-huh.
- With the big blond hair here,
and then it's the signature
RuPaul line.
I'm hoping to pitch it to you.
-<i> I didn't see RuPaul's head</i>
<i>in there at all.</i>
I just saw, like,
popcorn kernels.
-<i> And you're using the glitter,</i>
which is really interesting.
Next up, Raja.
- I kind of wanted to go for,
like, rocker chick Samantha Fox
meets<i> Burlesque,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> so I tried to</i>
concentrate a few of the...
- Well, I think that they're
perfect for motor-boating.
Bbbbbbb!
- Pfffft!
- Thank you, Raja.
Carmen Carrera.
Ooh, there's rhinestones in them
there hills.
- Mm-hmm.
- Did you breast-feed
with those?
- I don't breast-feed.
I pump.
- Oh, you pump.
Very Latoya.
For those of you who didn't
believe, roll up your sleeves.
Next up, Manila.
Now, is that a nursing bra?
- Well, I thought they looked
like rivets,
so I went for, like, a submarine
look for my torpedoes.
[imitates torpedoes firing]
[imitating gunfire]
-<i> Better luck next time, Manila.</i>
To kill RuPaul, you gotta be
faster than that.
- Uhh!
- Ladies, all of your designs
were truly bodacious.
<i>But I can only choose one.</i>
So cross my heart,
the winner is...
[suspenseful music]
Manila.
- Whoo!
<i>Yes!</i>
- Why, those are the fastest
tits in the west.
- [exhales sharply]
- Now, I told you this week was
all about my two favorite
things--"t" and "a."
The "t" was for ta-tas,
but the "a" is for...
America.
- Ohh!
-<i> Yes.</i>
There is no place like
the U.S. of A.
<i>For this week's main challenge,</i>
you'll each create a public
service announcement
entitled
"Why I love the U.S.A."
So the message should be
entertaining and from the heart,
because we'll be sending your
P.S.A.s
<i>to the brave men and women</i>
<i>who are serving our</i>
<i>country overseas.</i>
You'll each have ten minutes
in front of the camera,
and, Manila, since you won
the mini challenge,
you'll get an extra
five minutes.
<i>Gentlemen...</i>
start your engines.
And may the best American woman
win.
- It just kind of needs to be a
few words, right?
- Yeah, I'm doing, like,
snippets.
-<i> Yeah, that's what I'm thinking</i>
<i>of.</i>
<i>When it came time for me</i>
<i>to write my P.S.A.,</i>
I had to think about what
American values
do I cherish the most?
If it's too speech-y...
it's only supposed to be 30
to 60 seconds long,
<i>so you have to kind of fill it</i>
<i>in</i>
with just a few words, you know.
I always want it to feel
inspired,
and I definitely want to be
connected to it emotionally.
- Uh!
-<i> Ew!</i>
- Did you really seriously fart?
- [laughing]
- Sick.
- I'm having a hard time
with it.
- You are?
- Yes, I have so many things
that are personal.
- Mm-hmm.
- But I really don't want to
make it personal and sad,
<i>'cause I know it's gonna be sad</i>
<i>for me.</i>
It's just too much, too much.
I hope I don't cry.
-<i> Why would you cry?</i>
-<i> It's a lot of things.</i>
It's a lot of things.
- Like what?
- There's a lot of things
personal that I...
I wish I could say, but I can't.
- Made in the U.S.A.
Our main challenge today is to
shoot,
like, a 30-second public
service announcement
for our troops.
- Hey.
Can you hear my--
- Go ahead.
- "Right now I'm wearing no
clothes,
"because I don't want any brand,
any stereotypes to cover
who I am."
I don't want any brand to cover
my identify--my identity.
<i>You like it?</i>
- I didn't get it.
At the competition, Yara is a
very original girl,
and her personality help
her a lot.
But when it comes to talent
and performing,
I think Yara's still behind.
- Do you like that idea?
I'm gonna be naked.
- Yeah, but, baby, you gotta
let me write.
- Oh.
- You gotta let me write.
- I taught Shangela a few things
about makeup.
And today she doesn't want
to help me.
-<i> If I thought Yara needed</i>
<i>the help,</i>
I would help her,
but she doesn't.
<i>Girl, you can do it.</i>
-<i> Shangela and Alexis are like,</i>
<i>"Do your job."</i>
I know you're doing your job,
but before, I was doing my job,
and I helped you.
- So did you guys grow up
really, like, patriotic
and, like, "We love America"?
- I was born here, but I lived
in Indonesia
when I was a little boy,
and I remember thinking
of America as, like, the land
of candy bars and M&amp;Ms,
<i>so it was kind of a dreamland</i>
<i>for me.</i>
-<i> I know, it's kind of like</i>
<i>my mom,</i>
you know, coming from
a different country
where you're just like,
"America is the dream.
That's where I need to go."
- Being an American wasn't
something that was hard for me.
I was born into it.
<i>It was easy, but being</i>
<i>Carmen Carrera wasn't,</i>
and being married to my husband
wasn't.
I had to fight for all those
things,
so those are the things
that I'm really proud of.
[door opens]
- Well, hello, my star-spangled
ladies.
- Hi!
- I'm gonna check in and see
what you all are up to.
<i>Hi, Raja.</i>
What do you love about America?
- I love freedoms that I'm
allowed to have here.
I'm allowed to get in drag and
parade around the streets
and make money doing it.
- This needs to be uplifting,
entertaining,
and from the heart.
- Yes, sir.
- Okay? All right.
Carry on.
- All right.
- Hello, Manila.
- Hi.
- Why do you love America?
- There's just so many different
kinds of food here.
- So America to you means
a variety of different foods.
- Yes.
- What else does America mean
to you?
- Well, I think that is a symbol
of the diversity of America.
Different ethnicities and
cultures--they're all just
out here for the tasting.
<i>Try something new.</i>
Do it with an Indian guy.
- Now, of course, you are gonna
be talking
to the troops who are serving
this great nation of ours,
so we want you to express
yourself,
but just know that we want it to
come from the heart,
not come from between your legs.
I'm gonna let you get back
to work.
- Okay, thank you.
- I can't wait.
Carmen Carrera.
You, as you flutter your false
eyelashes--
is that what being an American
means to you?
- Yes.
I'm free, honey.
- Hello.
- No restrictions,
you know what I mean?
- Now, tell me what you have
planned for your P.S.A.
- My aunt has six boys,
and most of them are all
in the Army, the Navy.
I'm keeping in my mind that my
video's gonna get to them.
- That's a great idea.
- Thank you.
- Yara Sofia.
- Yes.
- Now, you're working on
your P.S.A.,
and you understand
where this will go.
- Yes.
- Okay.
- My dad is Army Reserve.
- Has he ever been shipped
overseas?
- Yes, to Iraq.
- Really?
- And you have no communication
with him.
I don't think I'm going
to mention
my father in that P.S.A.,
<i>'cause it's too emotional</i>
<i>for me.</i>
It was a very hard time
in my life.
- You have dialogue that you
will say.
Just give me a synopsis.
- If you don't love America,
how the hell you gonna love
yourself?
- [laughing]
- 'Cause you are America.
- It sounds so familiar.
- Yes.
- And you're just gonna stand
there.
You're not gonna do any of
the sensual Puerto Rican...
- I could be quiet.
- Yes.
- And I will express my cha-cha
inside.
- [laughing]
All right, Yara, I'll let you
get back to work.
- Thank you.
- Okay.
- Yes, Ru.
- Now, why are you proud to be
an American?
- Well, you know, my mom was in
Desert Storm twice,
and then she also fought
in Bosnia,
and she would call home, and she
would be like, "Make me laugh.
Tell me something funny."
so that's kind of the spirit of
what I want my P.S.A. to be.
All the way, wherever the
troops are,
I want to make them smile too.
- I'm excited.
- Yay. Me too.
- All right, get back to work.
- Thank you, Ru.
- All right.
Hey, Alexis.
- Hi, Ru.
- America.
- America.
- What's it mean to you?
- It's love. It's freedom.
- Do you know anybody
in the military?
- [sighs]
Three years ago, I met somebody
very special in my life.
We get our relationship
very secretly,
and, like, the best moments
of my life was with him.
And he got called to go to
service,
and I don't know nothing about
him since, like,
a year and a half, so I really
don't know if he's okay.
- During the P.S.A.,
are you going to be speaking
directly to him?
- I would love to.
- What would you say to him
right now?
- I would say I'm sorry,
because I took us
in a wrong way.
Like, I felt abandoned,
and I didn't say anything before
he left.
I was really upset.
I want to say I'm sorry and that
I love him so much
and that I am very proud of him.
- Your story is shared by
thousands of others
who have had people they love go
overseas to serve their country.
I have a feeling yours is gonna
be very heartfelt.
But keep it entertaining, okay?
All right, kiddo, get to work.
- Thank you.
- All right.
All right, dolls, this one's
for Lady Liberty,
so do me proud and don't fuck
it up.
<i>I'll see you in a moment.</i>
[fanfare]
-<i> This week, for our main</i>
<i>challenge,</i>
we're filming a public service
announcement,
basically, to the troops
and to share about
loving being an American.
- Hello!
-<i> All right, you can use any</i>
<i>of the props you'd like,</i>
<i>including the pit crew.</i>
-<i> Mmm.</i>
- Your ten minutes starts now.
- You know what?
Here we go,
'cause nothing says "I love
America" like a dog.
Not only are you protecting
we humans,
but also the furrier kind.
- Cut.
Shangela, do you think you're
getting your message across
as to why you love America?
- It's because of the freedom
that we have here, the freedom
that you're out there
protecting.
- I wish you'd be saying this
right now to the camera.
- Okay, we'll do that.
- Every moment counts.
<i>[The Star-Spangled Banner</i><span style="bodyStyle"> tune]</i>
Oh, no, baby, I'm a solo act.
Y'all can go off now.
Thank you.
- Carmen, are you ready to do
your P.S.A.?
- Um...
- That's a yes or no answer.
- All right, well, let's just
start.
- Carmen, if I were you,
I would squat all the way down
and then come up.
Yes, ma'am.
- Okay.
- But don't do that.
-<i> Okay, okay, okay.</i>
All right,
the Statue of Liberty.
Hey!
No foam here!
-<i> Uh-huh, it's all real--</i>
100% American,
made in the U.S.A.
- All right, so I'm gonna be
in the mirror,
and then I'm gonna be doubting
myself.
I'm gonna be like, "Oh!"
you know, like, "Mm!
Maybe I'm not that pretty."
- Carmen, look at me.
Don't explain it, just do it.
30 seconds.
- The American dream for me is
to have, like, wigs
and jewelry and hot dogs
and balloons.
Ooh!
- I'm Yara Sofia.
I'm<i> puertorriqueña.</i>
I'm American girl!
Right now I'm not wearing
no clothes.
- Betsy Ross,
eat your heart out.
- Oh, definitely.
- This is where--
Oh, I'm sorry, and go.
I love America 'cause I'm --
ah, fuck.
I love America.
I le--ah, ah, fahh!
- Take a deep breath,
and you got it.
- It's okay.
- I love America
'cause America let me be...
[strumming guitar]
a musician.
I want to make the troops laugh.
<i>It's a hard time for them,</i>
<i>and they need to laugh,</i>
'cause laugh cures everything.
[shouting]
<i>[Mexican Hat Dance]</i>
Hey!
- Only in America will you
find the diversity of different
backgrounds and ethnicities,
and each of them offer a
different kind of food to eat.
And I love to eat food.
[imitating flatulence]
-<i> We got that.</i>
Let's see what else you have.
- Okay.
Ooh, sweet cherry pie.
Hold it like this so people can
see the length of it, honey.
Oh! Yes!
That was good.
Mmm!
- Manila, just bring it back
to America
and why you love America.
- Boys out there serving our
country,
when you come back,
there is going to be
all the food you can eat.
- [laughing]
- Oh, my God.
- My name is Raja.
I'm proud to be an American.
America, the land--
sorry.
The land where it--sorry.
- Can we get some of the joy
of what you're saying?
<i>I can see you reading</i>
<i>your script in your head.</i>
-<i> So far, all I've been able</i>
<i>to do</i>
<i>is just present this funny side</i>
<i>of me</i>
<i>or a very serious kind</i>
<i>of runway look.</i>
You think I could fit my giraffe
ass in there?
-<i> [laughing]</i>
-<i> This is my opportunity</i>
<i>to just be pretty this time</i>
<i>and pinup-y.</i>
-<i> Anything you want to say</i>
<i>to our troops?</i>
- Um...
-<i> Look at the camera.</i>
- Speak from the heart.
- Oh.
God bless the troops.
- Mm, nice.
-<i> Oh!</i>
<i>- Alexis Mateo!</i>
- Hello!
- Wow!
- Hi, Michelle. Hi, Ru.
<i>I am very nervous about what</i>
<i>I have to say,</i>
because there's a lot of things
going in my mind right now
that are not that happy.
<i>But at this point, I just want</i>
<i>to go</i>
and do my best in front
of the camera.
-<i> Action!</i>
- It's time for a party.
It's a U.S.A. American
celebration!
I met the love of my life.
Now he serve in the U.S.
Military corps.
<i>Papi,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> I want you to come back</i>
home, baby!
-<i> Ooh, yeah.</i>
-<i> That's right, just pick it up.</i>
- Yeah, keep it going.
- And even if I was born on
the moon,
I would still be in America.
Sexy, no?
- What?
What did she say?
- Sexy, no?
This is so corny, I love it.
- [laughing]
- I think the troops are gonna
say,
"Who the hell is this crazy-ass
drag queen?"
Bam!
Bam!
Bam!
Get it, baby.
Only in America can a woman like
me have a freakin' chorizo!
- [laughing]
- Yes, baby!
Bam!
Oh!
-<i> Yeah, catch your breath.</i>
- You got a cramp, girl?
- I'm trying to feel where's
my genitals right now.
- Yes, yes, yes.
Ladies, thank you for serving
your country.
<i>Now, tomorrow I want you to</i>
<i>wear</i>
your most patriotic outfits
to the main stage,
where we will be joined by two
American icons.
<i>Swimsuit supermodel,</i>
the legendary Cheryl Tiegs
will be here...
all: Ooh!
- And Olympic figure skater
Johnny Weir.
- Word!
<i>Oh, my God, Johnny Weir.</i>
Love her!
<i>I'm gonna lick her if she gets</i>
<i>anywhere near me.</i>
- Good-bye for now,
and God bless America.
- Yeah.
- Yes.
- Yoo-hoo!
Show must go on.
- Good mornin'.
-<i> We're back in the workroom</i>
<i>this morning,</i>
and we are getting ready
for our patriotic runway.
- Do you guys think that it was
a little difficult
to be entertaining and heartfelt
at the same time?
- When you're not putting on an
act and you're being yourself,
it's not difficult to put your
feelings in front of everybody
at the same time being yourself.
- The way that I did mine was
that the spoken word
was heartfelt, and the visual
was entertaining.
- Did you speak in English
and Spanish?
- No, girl.
- But you speak Spanish,
don't you?
- No, I don't.
I understand Spanish.
- No, you speak Spanish.
- I speak broken Spanish.
- She does.
- You're Puerto Rican, right?
- Uh-huh.
But my mom is very Americanized.
- I would love to see Carmen
embrace Puerto Rican things.
-<i> I know Puerto Rican culture.</i>
It's always been part of my life
since I was little, but I think
that Yara and Alexis don't think
that I'm Puerto Rican enough,
which I don't care.
[upbeat music]
- Work, Marine Corps.
<i>I'm gonna wear</i>
<i>the military jacket,</i>
because no matter
what I'm wearing
and no matter
if I'm a drag queen
<i>I wanted to show respect</i>
<i>for the militaries</i>
and the Army,
<i>and I hope I look great.</i>
-<i> Ooh, you're so</i>
<i>Michael Jackson.</i>
<i>"Hee-hee!"</i>
-<i> That's a man.</i>
- This challenge
was kind of hard to me,
'cause I will like to entertain
and do happy things.
I don't want to remember
the year
that my father went to Iraq.
I miss my mom and my dad
so bad.
This challenge remembered me
my dad, of course.
He is Army Reserve.
-<i> I'm sure they miss you too.</i>
- Yes.
<i>A few years ago</i>
we didn't have my father, like,
on year,
and it was so, so hard.
Guys, I'm so loud.
Without me, the house sounds
really empty.
Sometimes when I'm next
to my father,
like, I drop things and--
"Oh!"
Like, watch out, girl!
Watch out, girl!
Don't be so gay here.
[laughs]
- And you get along with him
well?
-<i> Yes.</i>
- Yes. [laughs]
[RuPaul laughing]
[RuPaul's<i> Cover Girl]</i>
<i>Hey, guys.</i>
Welcome to the main stage
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
Michelle Visage?
- Yes, baby?
- God bless America.
And one of our forefathers,
Santino, is here.
<i>Hi, honey.</i>
I am so proud to be a part of
the Wig Party.
- I pledge my allegiance to you,
Ru.
- Good.
And Cheryl Tiegs,
the all-American girl, is here.
So glad you're here tonight.
- Thank you, sugar.
- And Johnny Weir is here
with us tonight.
Hi, Johnny.
- Hey, Ru, thanks for having me.
I am tucked in anticipation.
- Good. And keep it that way.
This week our queens were
challenged
to create patriotic
public service announcements
<i>to send to our troops overseas.</i>
Now, wearing their best
Yankee Doodle drag,
we salute them.
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.
<i>Manila...</i>
<i>for the love of money.</i>
<i>- Great Gatsby, look at her.</i>
-<i> My patriotic look is a 1920s</i>
<i>flapper silhouette,</i>
<i>but instead of fringe,</i>
<i>it's hundreds,</i>
<i>because there's nothing more</i>
<i>American</i>
<i>than the American U.S. "d."</i>
-<i> In God we trust.</i>
-<i> Carmen Carrera...</i>
<i>look at that pinup.</i>
-<i> The look for today's runway</i>
<i>is Carmen Carrera meets</i>
<i>Dita Von Teese in the 1950s.</i>
-<i> I love the stones accenting</i>
<i>the money bits in the back.</i>
-<i> Yes, the moneymaker.</i>
<i>Exactly.</i>
-<i> Star-spangled bang her.</i>
[laughter]
-<i> Alexis Mateo, giving you</i>
<i>military drag.</i>
-<i> An officer and a lady.</i>
-<i> I turned out a U.S. Official</i>
<i>uniform into a evening gown.</i>
-<i> I want to see where</i>
<i>the pistol's hidden.</i>
-<i> Yes.</i>
<i>Who are you wearing?</i>
<i>Oh, wait.</i>
<i>Don't ask, don't tell.</i>
-<i> Exactly.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
[laughter]
-<i> Yara Sofia...</i>
<i>Now, this is a traditional</i>
<i>Puerto Rican costume, isn't it?</i>
-<i> Is it?</i>
-<i> Yeah, I saw it on a J.Lo</i>
<i>special.</i>
-<i> [laughing]</i>
-<i> This is the national costume</i>
<i>from Puerto Rico.</i>
<i>It's very patriotic,</i>
<i>but there is a surprise.</i>
<i>- Oh, what's happening?</i>
<i>- Oh!</i>
<i>- This is a traditional</i>
<i>Puerto Rican outfit.</i>
<i>- We see her rice</i>
<i>and her beans.</i>
-<i> Yes, we do.</i>
<i>- Mm.</i>
-<i> Yara, did you double-park</i>
<i>your invisible plane?</i>
<i>This is Shangela.</i>
<i>A bouquet?</i>
<i>Wow.</i>
-<i> What I have to wear is simple,</i>
<i>but it's still patriotic.</i>
<i>It's like classic '50s,</i>
<i>Marilyn Monroe-esque,</i>
<i>but I'm gonna turn it</i>
<i>Shangie style.</i>
-<i> She's serving a little</i>
<i>Eva Longoria.</i>
-<i> A little bit of Marilyn Monroe</i>
<i>there for a second.</i>
-<i> Happy birthday, Mr. President.</i>
-<i> Oh, wow!</i>
<i>- Nava-ho.</i>
-<i> How!</i>
<i>- That's all I ever heard.</i>
-<i> I've chosen tonight to do</i>
<i>a look</i>
<i>that's a little bit</i>
<i>Native American</i>
<i>and a lot of rock and roll.</i>
-<i> "Dances with drag queens."</i>
-<i> Yes.</i>
<i>"Legend of the Walks Far</i>
<i>Woman."</i>
Welcome, my fellow
drag Americans.
- Yes.
- All right, let's get to it.
Let's start with Shangela.
Cheryl, what'd you think of
Shangela's runway presentation?
- The outfit is very, uh,
simple.
<i>You see the others--there's</i>
<i>a lot more going on.</i>
- The lame is coming off
a little lame for me.
You know, it's not quite
banging enough.
- Thank you, Amadeus.
- [laughing]
- Let's take a look at your
P.S.A.
- Hey, all you fierce-ass
freedom fighters, it's me,
Shangela, and let me tell you,
I appreciate you out there.
We miss you, and we want you
home safely...
<i>[The Star-Spangled Banner</i><span style="bodyStyle"> tune]</i>
Ooh!
Hallelu.
- [laughing]
- I thought you did a really
good job on your P.S.A.
<i>You knew exactly what you were</i>
<i>gonna do.</i>
- Hallelu.
[laughter]
- I felt like the costume,
the singing, everything was
so fun and vibrant.
- All right, next up,
Carmen Carrera.
- The Statue of Liberty--
ever since I was a child,
it has been a symbol of freedom,
acceptance, and diversity
for everyone to be able to live
the American dream.
Our forefathers have made it
possible for us,
and now it's you who's ensuring
the future of our children.
- Yes.
- Carmen, you have to stay
in character.
You have a tendency to,
dare I say, look bored.
-<i> That was my biggest thing.</i>
I wanted you to excite me
and make me want to sign up,
<i>but it was just very, very</i>
<i>soft.</i>
I just wanted a little bit more
command of the voice,
especially with this attitude
and this look that you've got.
- Carmen, when you first
came out, I gasped.
<i>It was very sultry.</i>
Standing here, you've lost that
a little bit.
- You're standing there like
you could really give two shits
about what we think.
- No, I don't want you
to think that.
- But that's how it's coming
across.
All right, ladies, next up,
Alexis Mateo.
Now, you told me in
the workroom
that you had a lover who went
to war.
Did you direct your P.S.A.
toward him?
- I tried to make my P.S.A.
a little bit underground message
for him.
Oh, my gosh, if he was watching
right now,
I would've loved to say that
I miss him a lot.
Inside my heart,
I'm still waiting for you.
- Well, let's take a look
at your patriotic P.S.A..
- It's Alexis Mateo<i> con sabor</i>
from Puerto Rico!
This is the only land
where you can grow up and become
whoever you want to be.
I'm a fucking drag queen!
Ha ha ha!
Bam!
Bam!
<i>Papi,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> I want you to come back</i>
home, baby!
Celebrate life.
Celebrate love.
Celebrate freedom.
- Oh, my goodness.
- Ooh-ee.
- Bam, Michelle Visage.
- Bam!
<i>Alexis, you came out with one</i>
<i>thing you wanted to do.</i>
That was dance and be happy with
a piece of lame,
<i>and it worked.</i>
We couldn't breathe,
we were laughing so hard.
- Your P.S.A. was so much fun.
<i>"I'm a fucking drag queen!"</i>
<i>That sums it up.</i>
That's right, mama.
- Thank you, Beethoven.
Is this the jacket of
your ex-boyfriend?
- Yes, he left me this
as a memory.
So today I decide to wear it.
- If you're all covered up
in the high neck on the jacket,
<i>show us a little something.</i>
You know, you don't have
to show us everything.
I don't want to see your
honey basket.
- [laughs]
-<i> I love a queen in uniform.</i>
And you respected this,
and by "respect,"
I mean definitely put
Swarovskis all over it.
[laughter]
- All right, next up,
Yara Sofia.
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>
- This is the national costume
for dancing.
It's called bomba.
This is also part
of their religion.
It's called Santeria.
- You're not gonna kill
a chicken, are you?
- No, no!
- 'Cause I'm hungry, girl.
Let's take a look and see
what happened.
- I'm Yara Sofia,
and I love America.
America let me be the Latina!
I feel free, darling!
Hey!
If you don't love America,
how the hell you gonna love
yourself?
- Okay,<i> guapa,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> this is the deal.</i>
Your P.S.A.,
don't just be crazy.
If you're gonna be crazy,
be crazy with a purpose.
I expect more from you now,
Yara.
- It was a little bit crazy.
I'm not gonna lie.
<i>There wasn't a lot of class</i>
<i>and integrity in it.</i>
<i>I just thought it was kind of</i>
<i>jumping all over the place.</i>
- All right, next up,
our flapper, Manila.
Tell us about your look.
- Well, I'm trying to go for
a thoroughly modern millionaire.
-<i> Oh, I love it.</i>
Well, let's take a look
at your P.S.A.
- I'm an American,
and I love to eat out at
different kinds of restaurants.
Only in America will you find
the diversity
of different backgrounds
and ethnicities,
and each of them offer a
different kind of food to eat--
hot dogs, sushi, Italian,
kielbasa.
[imitating flatulence]
Oh, America, you taste so good.
- Being a lady, I am not quite
so sure
about when you emit some gas.
[laughs]
- Relying on a fart joke
in the P.S.A.,
<i>the message of having freedom</i>
<i>of choice</i>
<i>just got completely lost</i>
<i>for me.</i>
- Thank you, Mr. Lagerfeld.
- [laughing]
-<i> Manila, I am so in love</i>
<i>with you tonight.</i>
I love everything about this
look on you.
<i>It's absolutely stunning to me.</i>
I just gotta be honest, I can't
stand you as a blonde girl.
-<i> The blond wig and the outfit,</i>
I just felt I saw
Jessica Simpson,
and I feel like I wouldn't want
to look like Jessica Simpson.
- All right, next up, Raja.
Can you get more American than
Native American?
- How.
- [laughing]
- Let's take a look at your
patriotic P.S.A.
- I'm Raja, and I'm proud to be
am American.
<i>Growing up in Indonesia,</i>
<i>my parents taught me that I</i>
<i>could be</i>
<i>whatever I wanted to be.</i>
<i>America--where the son</i>
<i>of immigrants</i>
can wear her freedom proudly.
- Raja, I thought you were
amazing on the runway.
The P.S.A. was a little stiff.
- Take me to your tepee.
- Okay.
- I saw Cher, like<i> Half Breed,</i>
Janis Joplin, and it's awesome.
- Thank you, Gandalf.
- [laughing]
- It's kind of like there are
two versions of being cold.
<i>The runway walk,</i>
<i>it's cold in a way</i>
that is so scorching and so hot
that you can freeze anyone
that's watching you.
And then when the video came up,
it was just a wet, dead fish.
- Thank you, ladies.
I think we've heard enough.
<i>Now, while you go and untuck</i>
<i>in the Interior Illusions</i>
<i>lounge,</i>
the judges and I will
deliberate.
<i>You may leave the stage.</i>
[engine turning]
Now, just between us girls,
<i>what do you think?</i>
<i>Let's start with Shangela.</i>
- The fit on that dress
is horrid.
It's slightly American,
patriotic--slightly.
- I really feel that a polished
drag queen
would never come in that outfit
tonight.
- Right.
- The performance on the runway
tonight--it was just kind of...
- I thought her P.S.A. was kind
of canned.
Felt that it was kind of like
part of her shtick.
<i>Carmen Carrera...</i>
- The P.S.A.
was personality-less.
- Yeah.
- She was a stink-ball.
-<i> She did her beautiful walk.</i>
<i>She looked lovely,</i>
<i>and then she stood there,</i>
and she may as well have been
chewing on a piece of wheat,
<i>taking a dump, doing her nails.</i>
This girl, if she ever wants
to be a huge success--
people will not buy tickets,
she will not be able to pay
her rent,
and she will be flipping
burgers.
-<i> She will die penniless.</i>
- Yes.
-<i> Alexis Mateo...</i>
She seemed very somber
on the runway.
-<i> I liked the somberness,</i>
because she was being
a respectable
marine woman to me.
I felt like it was part
of the persona.
- I laughed hard at her P.S.A.
<i>I thought it was very funny.</i>
And her jumpsuit--
it was just amazing.
It was like the ugliest fabric,
but--and the silhouette was
so on point and so fun,
I couldn't take my eyes off
of her.
-<i> Yara...</i>
- I was really thrown when
I first saw her in that curly,
frizzy hair.
<i>I didn't like that, because she</i>
<i>was quite stunning,</i>
I thought, on the runway.
- This P.S.A. that's wild
and over-the-top,
it very shrill for me.
<i>You're constantly</i>
<i>going, going, going.</i>
When is it going to stop?
- Her P.S.A. Fell flat for me.
<i>Yara has to rein it in.</i>
- Right.
- It doesn't...
[blurting gibberish]
All the time have to be out
there like that.
- Let's move on to Manila.
- Manila lost me within the
first five seconds,
uh, because of going in the
direction of bathroom humor.
- It's comedy, people.
Why does everything have to be
so serious?
I appreciate a good crass video.
There's a lot of people like me
out there,
and I loved her runway look
tonight.
-<i> Raja...</i>
<i>- I like Raja.</i>
That costume, which was so
outrageous--
she just carried it,
and I really like that.
- As the pinup girl in her
P.S.A.,
really stunning, beautiful.
<i>But when she starts to speak,</i>
<i>there's a disconnect.</i>
- The message was beautiful,
but it was as flat as I was
before Dr. 90210.
- Hello.
- Okay?
- Silence!
<i>I've made my decision.</i>
Bring back my girls.
<i>Welcome back, ladies.</i>
<i>Based on your performance</i>
in the patriotic challenge
and your presentation
on the main stage,
I've made some decisions.
Shangela, your runway
presentation
was underwhelming.
<i>And compared to the others,</i>
your P.S.A. Was just okay.
You're safe.
- Thank you.
- Manila...
you made a meal out
of this challenge.
But it left a bad taste in some
of the judges' mouths.
<i>You...</i>
are safe.
- Thank you.
- Carmen Carrera.
<i>You're pretty.</i>
<i>But your patriotic P.S.A.</i>
lacked pizzazz and personality.
I'm sorry, my dear, but you are
up for elimination.
-<i> I'm in the bottom,</i>
<i>and I'm a little surprised.</i>
I'm not a mediocre bitch.
- Alexis Mateo,
<i>you turned sadness</i>
<i>into gladness</i>
and made us proud.
Con-drag-ulations, you are the
winner of this challenge.
[applause]
<i>You've won a three-piece,</i>
<i>super-lightweight,</i>
<i>luxury-luggage set from Antler.</i>
Yes, Antler.
- Thank you.
- Is there anything you'd like
to say?
- [sighs]
I know some things that happen
in life--
<i>it teach you a lot of, like,</i>
<i>valuable lessons.</i>
And this one helped me to grow,
'cause I normally depend a lot
from people.
<i>And I want to say thank you</i>
to that special person
that's shown me
that I needed to love myself
first.
- Alexis, you may join
the other girls.
- Thank you.
-<i> Raja...</i>
You pummeled the runway.
But when it came to the
challenge,
you stumbled.
Yara Sofia...
Your performance in the P.S.A.
was entertaining,
but are you resting on wacky?
I'm sorry, my dear, but you are
up for elimination.
- I am very in shock.
<i>I cannot breathe.</i>
<i>I cannot cry.</i>
<i>I cannot laugh.</i>
<i>I don't know why I am</i>
<i>in the bottom two.</i>
- Raja, you are safe.
<i>Two queens stand before me.</i>
<i>Prior to tonight, you were</i>
<i>asked</i>
<i>to prepare a lip-synced</i>
<i>performance</i>
<i>of</i><span style="bodyStyle"> Mickey</i><i> by Toni Basil...</i>
in Spanish.
- Yara doesn't have an advantage
over me
just 'cause she speaks Spanish.
I want to make this one one
for the history books.
-<i> Ladies, this is your</i>
<i>last chance</i>
to impress me
and save yourselves from
elimination.
The time has come for you to
lip-sync...
<i>para tu vida!</i>
<i>Good luck.</i>
And do not...
fuck it up.
[Toni basil singing in Spanish]
- Oh, my god, Carmen--
she knows every single word,
and she is just pooching
the song.
She better work, Heather.
- [laughing]
-<i> Yara was very patriotic,</i>
and she's doing Puerto Rico
very proud.
-<i> We are doing our lip sync,</i>
<i>and Carmen is kissing Johnny.</i>
<i>It's not kissing for your life.</i>
[applause]
-<i> Work, Carmen! Work!</i>
<i>Work, Yara!</i>
-<i> Ladies...</i>
I have made my decision.
Carmen Carerra...
shante, you stay.
- Thank you.
- Yara Sofia...
shante, you stay.
- [softly] What?
<i>Are you joking, Ru?</i>
No, no, do not joke that way,
please.
- For the first time in
<i>Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> history,</i>
no one is going home tonight.
This is the land of opportunity.
<i>And I've decided you both</i>
<i>deserve</i>
to stay and fight another day.
Now, remember, if you can't love
America,
how in the hell are you gonna
love somebody else?
[laughing]
Can I get a "amen" in here?
all: Amen!
- All right, let the music play.
- Whoo-hoo!
-<i> Grand prize contributed</i>
<i>in part</i>
<i>by AlandChuck.travel.</i>- Previously,
on<i> RuPaul's Drag Race...</i>
Transform these silver daddies
into your drag mamas.
Steven,
you're the mother of Raven.
- She thinks she's being cunty
by giving me someone
who had a full facial beard?
I'm gonna turn it out
and show her,
"No, bitch, you didn't get it."
[laughter]
- I can tell
she's getting tired,
so I grab her
and take her to the back.
[cheers and applause]
- Raven, congratulations.
You're the winner
of this week's challenge.
Two queens stand before me.
Jujubee.
Shante, you stay.
- Thank you.
- Pandora, sashay away.
And tonight...
[feigning tears] I'd to thank
all the members of the Academy,
my personal tucker.
The queens hit the red carpet.
- Oh, my God,
I feel like a cross-dresser.
- I think I did my job.
- Who will be the biggest diva?
The Diva of the Year Award
goes to...
[all gasping]
- Thank you.
- With extra special guest
judges,
Marissa Jaret Winokur
and Tatum O'Neal.
The winner of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i>
will receive a lifetime supply

[engines revving]
- Oh, my God, it is so empty.
- I know.
- Wow.
- We're down to the final four.
You definitely feel the lack of
other contestants in the room.
- "Lick this Boxx..."
- "Bitch."
- How do you guys feel about me
being in the bottom
last night with Pandora?
Did I deserve to go home?
- Off of just the lip-sync,
I thought
they were gonna choose Pandora.
- But what was
the reason behind that?
- My eyes were going to Pandora.
- I don't look at Pandora
and see a star.
I look at you, and I see a star.
- I think her runway
should have put her
in the bottom two
a long time ago.
- Yes.
- She never, like,
sparkled to me.
- Who cares who Raven
thinks is a star?
I sure don't.
I'm sure she thinks
that she is a star.
And I sure don't.
- I mean, lookit.
This thing
was packed full of shit
and people all up on it.
And now there's four of us here.
I really miss my friends,
though.
- I would talk to my drag mother
every day at, like, 10:00.
- Do you talk
to your drag mother
more than your real mother?
- I don't talk
to my real mother at all.
- You don't?
- No, girl.
She abandoned me.
- My father died when I was 15.
Six months later,
my mother found somebody else,
and she left me to take care of
my two younger sisters
and to just grow up by myself,
and...I just stopped
being a kid.
I just want to thank my mother,
Charisma Jeneva Jackson Taye.
[siren]
- Ooh, girl!
You got shemail.
Hey, dolls, if you still think
Liza robbed Diana
of the Oscar in 1972;
if you look in the mirror
every morning and cry out,
"You like me!
You really like me!"
then maybe, just maybe,
you could be America's
next drag superstar.
[car engine racing]
- Hello, hello, hello.
- Hey, Ru.
- Good morning.
- Well, well, well.
You're the fantastic final four.
And you know
the next drag superstar
must possess a unique style,
and she wouldn't be caught dead
wearing the same dress
as another diva.
For today's mini-challenge,
you'll be given
identical outfits
and 30 minutes
to style and accessorize them
in a way to make them your own.
After that, I'll return to
decide which queen wore it best.
No cutting or gluing allowed.
- Oh, God.
- Ladies, make it fabulous
and make it your own.
I'll see you later.
30 minutes.
- Work.
<i>Trabaja.</i>
- Come on, Twila.
It's you and me.
- Are these dresses
all the same size?
I don't even think your tits
can even fit in here.
- Oh, my God,
I feel like a cross-dresser.
- I'm gonna wear this hair.
- I gotta put
some lipstick on, at least.
- I look over and I see Juju
buffing makeup over her stubble.
[laughter]
- You guys laughing?
- Girl, we have on fuckin' wigs.
- [laughing]
And not a stitch of makeup.
- I put some makeup on.
Girl, look at me.
- Ew! You better put lashes on,
you dirty whore.
- I don't need no makeup.
I got fish face.
I'm daytime. I'm real.
- Yeah, girl,
you look like trout, okay?
- Hello, hello, hello.
- Did En Vogue
get back together?
- Yeah!
- You girls work fast.
Look at you.
I can't believe
you got up in full drag.
- Mama.
- And she's
padded and everything.
You've got the leggings on.
Tell me about your decision
to do leggings with this.
- You know what it was?
I didn't have time to really
hide the pad lines,
and I wanted to kind of go
a little bit more R&amp;B with it.
- It does elongate you.
Now, Raven, you chose
all black accessories.
You look like a spy.
Are you a spy, girl?
- I was just going for a
little dark sophistication,
with a little hint
of last year's Rihanna.
- And you went
for scrunch boots.
- Yeah, well,
they came all the way up,
so I pushed them down.
- I've never been
a fan of the scrunch boots,
unless the lady has legs
as long as mine are, you know.
Now, Tatianna, are those
two holes in your ears?
- I have two holes,
so I thought,
why not match it up?
- Tell me about
your silver shoes.
- Well, I didn't want
to do a black shoe,
and I thought,
why not do a silver pump?
Give a little bit
of sparkle down south.
- I think that maybe Tatianna
over-accessorized.
She looks like
a 99 cent store mess.
- All right, now, miss Tyra,
you made yourself a clutch.
- Yeah, I didn't have one.
- Uh-huh, and you decided
to go the classy lady--
ladies who lunch.
From the funeral to the wake
to the after party
and then on to the club.
- And then to pick up
the children to go home.
- And then to pick up
the children.
It's a very elegant look
that any lady
at home watching
would feel very comfortable in.
- Thank you.
- All right, ladies,
the queen who wore it best is...
Tyra.
Tyra Sanchez, the other Tyra.
Ladies, exciting news.
For your main challenge,
you've all been nominated for
the First Annual Diva Awards!
[all scream]
Yes! Yes!
Now, the Diva Awards
are your chance
to show some serious
awards show realness.
You'll need to pull together
three different outfits
for three different
Diva Award ceremonies.
First up, the Teen Diva Awards,
where you must dress
as a hot teen queen...
using clothes provided by
the House of Infinite Radness.
Then it's the Diva
D.C. Press Awards,
where you'll be serving
some executive realness,
Washington, D.C., Style.
And finally, the Diva
Hollywood Extravaganza Awards,
where you'll be expected
to gag us
with your glamour and eleganza.
I'll be back later
to see how your pre-show
preparations are going.
Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best woman win!
Go!
[laughing]
- The first thing I saw
was lime green fur.
So I grabbed
every piece of fur that I saw.
- It's nerve-wracking,
because you don't know what the
others are gonna pull out.
Now, in this competition,
it's getting to,
they're looking for the best.
You don't know
what each person is gonna do.
Our challenge this week is
to create three different looks
at the Diva Awards.
A hot, teen look
for the Teen Diva Awards.
Executive realness
for the D.C. Diva Press Awards.
And a glamorous red carpet look
for the Diva
Hollywood Extravaganza.
- I had something like this
in high school, actually.
- Me too.
- [laughing]
- I felt like the biggest fag.
- Oh, you wore it as a boy?
- I didn't go to school
as a girl, Tatianna.
- [laughing]
- Okay?
Tatianna is stuck
in that realm of, "I am a girl."
I think, as a drag queen,
you should culture yourself.
Maybe I'll go all, like,
Mary Kate on everybody
and just wear 30 things at once.
You should be a chameleon.
If I lose to you...
I'll be fine.
- I want to win this challenge.
- Girl, I want
to win<i> a</i><span style="bodyStyle"> challenge.</i>
We have to be number one
and number two.
- Them winning is not an option.
- I think that Juju and I
will both help each other out
as much as we can
to make sure
that we make it to the top.
- Is this Hollywood elegance?
- I think so.
- RuPaul keeps repeating,
"Charisma, uniqueness,
nerve, and talent."
I think I have that.
I think Raven has that.
I know the other girls carry
some of those traits,
but I don't think
they have the full package.
[mumbling]
[falsetto]
- Keep on singing, girl.
- I'm sorry.
- No, do it.
You have a beautiful voice.
God gave you a gift, so use it.
[both chuckling]
- Over there trying to read.
- What do you feel about
missing Jeremiah's first day?
- I'm sad
that I'm gonna miss it.
I'm praying that his mom
takes pictures.
My son is starting
preschool today,
and I'm missing out
on his first day of school.
So I'm really gonna, like--
I'm, like, sad about it.
It's been nine weeks
since I've seen my son.
It's just driving me crazy.
I miss Jeremiah so much.
But I know that me being here
and getting a chance
to give him a better life
is all worth it.
Yes. You better do it, Tyra.
Mm-hmm.
- I sat and thought
for a majority of the morning,
thinking of the silhouette
I wanted to work with,
how I was going to utilize
the fabric that I ended up with.
[sewing machine whirring]
You never waste
your time thinking.
- Do I have feathers
all over my face?
'Cause they're
all over the floor.
- I can feel it.
- Sorry, but I want
to be fabulous.
- I just see fuzz flying
all over the fuckin' room.
And I'm like,
"what the fuck Is this?"
Tyra looks like she skinned
all of the Muppets
and is making a gown out of fur.
- I don't know
what the deal with her is.
I don't if she's
just playing a game.
Maybe she's just making this
just to kind of throw us off.
- Fabulous, darling.
Fabulous.
- I've never made
a gown like that before.
It's gonna have
more of a complicated,
more expensive look,
but it's really only, like,
three pieces of fabric
and some hot glue.
- Hello, divas!
- all: Hi.
- Oh, wow, look at this.
You're all busy at work here.
- You better work.
- Yes, mama.
Hey, Tyra.
- Hey, Ru.
- Look at you down there.
Now, which one
of the awards shows is that for?
- Elegant evening gowns.
So I want to be in a gown,
but I want it to stand out.
- Do you feel
that you're the one to beat?
Do you feel that confident?
- I do feel that confident.
I've been challenging myself
and making myself better.
- Yeah,
I've got to mention this.
Now, you're here,
and the fur is flying around,
and it's itching your face.
Now, that may be a red flag
for how it will perform
on the red carpet.
You see what I'm saying?
You might need to vacuum it
before you wear it.
- [laughing]
- Thank you, Tyra.
- Are you ready
for the biggest night
of your psychological life?
- It is pretty psychological.
- It's very psychological.
- So I see three
different ladies over there.
- I'm debating on my executive.
- Uh-huh.
- Most likely, I'm gonna
be going with this one.
- What says D.C. Diplomat
Press Awards to you?
- To me,
it just kind of reminds me
of something
that Sarah Palin would wear.
- 'Cause Sarah Palin
is your idol, and you--
- Oh, yes, I love her.
- Really?
- Please.
[both laughing]
- Everything that you've
learned about drag,
about yourself
up until this moment,
you have to put
into this challenge.
This is the big one,
and you gotta bring it.
- Thank you.
- Hey, Jujubee.
- Hi, mama.
- Wow, what do you
got going on here?
Is this
for your Hollywood eleganza?
- Yes.
- It still seems
a little understated here.
What are you planning to do
to Juju it up?
- You just said it.
I'm just gonna Juju it up.
- Uh-huh.
Last week, you did wind up
in the bottom two,
and the stakes are oh, so high.
- I know.
- Well, listen,
you keep on working it, mama.
Stay down. Stay down.
Stay hood.
- Stay here.
- Stay here, that's right.
All right.
Hey, Tatianna.
- Hello.
- I see you over here
pondering your outfits here.
- Yes.
- What are we looking at?
This is your teen outfit.
- No.
- What is it?
- That is for
the Hollywood red carpet.
- Extravaganza.
I'm just a little worried
about the cha-cha of this here.
What do you think Santino
will say about this?
- I've never done anything
like that before.
- That's not an excuse, is it?
You never--just because you
haven't done it, doesn't mean--
- Well, they haven't seen it,
so they haven't
commented on anything.
- Look, Tatianna,
we're at that place.
You gotta bring it.
You're under double scrutiny.
Triple scrutiny.
- Yeah.
- Because you have three
different looks
and three different
opportunities to be criticized.
- See, I think of it
as the positive:
You have three different chances
to wow the judges
rather than just one.
- Well, listen, I don't want
to throw you off your game,
but I'm telling you, these
bitches are coming for you.
- Yeah.
- If you were ever gonna pull
something out of your ass,
now would be the time to do it.
Thank you, Tatianna.
- Thank you.
- Ladies, gather round.
Tomorrow, at the Diva Awards,
our extra-special guest judges
will be Tony Award-winner
Marissa Jaret Winokur
from<i> Hairspray.</i>
That's right.
And Oscar-winner Tatum O'Neal.
- [gasps]
- Yes, we have people who have
snatched trophies hunting.
- We're having a Tony Award
winner and an Oscar winner
sitting there judging us
on how we maintain ourself
at an awards ceremony.
It's no joke.
- Now, listen, I know you have
a lot on your plate.
But there's just one more
little twist, Tina, darling.
Now, before you hit
the awards show circuit,
the four of you
will need to perform
a Diva Awards opening number.
The song and outfits
have been chosen,
but you need to work together
on the choreography.
Now, Tyra, because you
won the mini challenge,
I'm leaving you in charge
of the opening number.
- I'm in charge of the girls?
- You're in charge
of the opening number.
- Hi, mama.
- Working in a group
wouldn't be my first choice,
but I'm gonna work hard,
'cause there's no way in hell
that I'm gonna let
someone else fail
and put me in the bottom two.
- Now, tomorrow
on the main stage,
I expect you girls to be
dripping with charisma,
uniqueness, nerve, and talent.
[feigning tears]
And finally,
I'd like to thank
all the members of the Academy,
my personal tucker,
and last, but not least,
to my four little darling divas.
I just want to say,
don't fuck it up.
I promised myself
I wouldn't cry.
Good-bye. Good luck.
- Bye, Ru.
- And keep it real.
- What song is it?
- I don't know.
- The last time Tyra
had to work in a group,
she wanted to leave her group.
It's a recipe for disaster.
- I thought it was my name
for a minute.
- The four of us
have to do a number
for the opening
of the Diva Awards.
Am I happy about it? No.
'Cause it takes time away from
me getting my shit together.
- So we're gonna--
okay, so we're gonna
walk out to the intro
and stand by our letter
like you are?
Right to the side of it?
- Do you want us to all
have the same pose,
or do you want us
to all have different poses,
but we just
don't break those poses
until it gets to our line?
- Um...
- So we look at Tyra,
and we're trying to figure out
what the direction is for this.
And she's not really giving
anything,
and then she does,
and we're like...okay...
- We walk out.
When does this happen?
- At the beginning.
- When what happens?
- Right at the beginning?
- This is the end.
- Oh, this is the end.
- I think it showed that Tyra
isn't the best
with choreography,
because there
wasn't choreography.
It was just kind of,
"We're gonna pose
and then we're gonna spin
"and then we're gonna pose.
And then we're gonna
stack letters and pose."
And it was very posey.
- Who's singing this part?
- We'll figure it out later.
- I'm the one with the attitude.
- Oh, I guess
I'll just stay here.
- Our rehearsal was a hot mess.
And so I'm really hoping that we
can pull this off tomorrow.
Thank you.
[alarm beeps]
- Just me.
- You are so shady.
- Bitch, please.
- Is everybody confident with
the things that they have?
- Yeah, I couldn't
sleep last night, though.
I was sitting there thinking,
what the hell?
I wasn't happy with my teen
dream whatever.
- I hope this shirt fits me.
- I'm so scared
about this dress.
I wanted to make a full gown,
completely made out of fur.
But I realize
that I don't like it,
so now I have to change my
entire plans
and come up with a new look.
- So today
determines the top three,
and I'm gonna be there.
- I definitely think
that I deserve to be here.
I think I work very, very hard.
- I know I deserve to.
I worked really hard,
and I've grown a lot
since I've been here.
And I think
that they know it too.
- You know, I may have had
to lip-synch for my life twice,
but it got to the point where
the challenges got harder,
and I won two of them.
- Y'all won two.
You won two.
You got one.
And I have zero.
I do not want to be
in the bottom two again.
You know, this is gonna be
a third time, if I do.
And last I remember,
Sahara did it three times,
and she went home.
- Now, who do you think's
gonna be in the top three?
- Me.
- Me.
- Name all three people.
- Why don't you start then?
- Okay, I think it's gonna be
me, you and Tyra.
Tyra has shown consistency.
You have brought
a sense of energy.
I have given them
what they are looking for.
And it seems like Tatianna
hasn't done
what they want from her yet.
So, Tatianna, who do you think
is in the top three?
- Um, I hope it's me.
And that's really all
I have to say on the matter.
- Tyra.
- I would have
to agree with you.
But things could change
if she pulls it together today.
I think she, like, would,
like, have to really,
like, wow the judges.
- Jujubee.
- You know, I--I hate
to be like this,
but Tatianna, don't hate me.
- All right.
- But I have to agree
with you, Raven.
Don't be mad at me, girl.
- I've known for a while
that all the girls
don't think I'm competition.
But a lot of those girls who
thought I wasn't competition
have gone home.
In my head, I'm just like...
think that, feel that, own it.
Whatever.
You're not
gonna break my spirit.
- You know I only bring shit up
that I absolutely have to.
- You're such a bitch.
I love it.
[giggles]
[RuPaul laughing]
[applause]
- Hey, judges.
Santino Rice.
Why, you old geezer.
- [laughing]
- Merle, hi, honey.
- Honey,
I don't have to tell you
to gather ye rosebuds
while ye may tonight.
- [laughs]
Marissa!
- Hello.
Your hair is amazing.
- Oh, you know,
I just washed it;
I couldn't do a thing with it.
Tatum O'Neal is here.
So happy to have you.
- Thank you.
- Are you ready to see my girls?
- Hell, yeah.
- Excellent.
This week,
our ladies were challenged
to pull off three
award-winning looks.
Now, to kick things off,
our ladies have prepared
a show-stopping opening number.
Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best<i> woman</i><span style="bodyStyle"> win!</i>
[jazzy music]
- The show is going great.
- And then I forget
one of the steps.
- Jujubee was off.
- all:
[all singing scales]
- all: Bitch.
[cheers and applause]
Ladies and gentlemen,
here come our girls
for the Teen Diva Awards.
Tatianna.
Oh, my God, you guys,
she's so cute.
- Is that from, like, BCBG?
- I'm feeling
like I'm selling it,
and I'm really giving
the aura of hot teen actress.
- Bye.
Oh, my God, that is so Raven.
- That's like teen Chanel.
- It is teen Chanel.
- I feel cute, I feel fun.
I'm just bouncing
down the catwalk.
- I really want
to lose three pounds, Raven.
Yes.
- [laughing]
- Jujubee.
- She's a mean girl.
- Oh, is this the B.E.T.
Teen Awards?
She must be from Baldwin hills.
[laughter]
- I'm so comfortable with this
hip-hop look right now.
I am channeling
miss Mary J. Blige.
- Yeah, MJB, y'all.
Ooh!
[gasps]
Is that Solange Knowles?
No, honey, it is Tyra.
- I felt as if I had turned 16
all over again.
- Oh, my God, Tyra,
you were supposed to text me.
Breaking news.
Let's go live
to the D.C. Diva Press Awards.
Sarah Palin!
She can see Russia
from her house.
I'm feeling super confident.
It's a look that I've
never tried before.
But I still felt sexy.
- Oh, she's got a call.
Hello? Rush Limbaugh?
Why, you fat fuck!
[laughter]
- Oh...Leslie Stahl, yes.
Right?
Well, she's giving
a speaker of the house.
- I'm just gonna give power.
I'm getting an award
for taking care of business.
- Meet you at the Watergate
for lunch.
Jujubee.
Is she a lawyer?
- I think she's getting a call
from the husband.
- He's saying,
"Stop buying all that ESCADA.
It's costing me too much money."
- I'm kind of channeling
a fierce executive.
She refuses to wear skirts.
She wears the pants
in the family.
- She's very Nancy Pelosi.
But, see,
she can move her forehead.
And her ass.
Mary J. Pelosi.
[laughter]
Tyra Sanchez.
Eat your heart out,
Michelle Obama.
- The judges have never seen me
in pants.
And so it's giving them
a different look for me.
But still Tyra--
nice and elegant,
but totally different look.
- Yes, she can.
- I'm James St. James,
author, nightlife dinosaur,
and red carpet perennial,
here at the Diva Awards.
- Here's a young starlet,
Tatianna.
- Come here, come here.
Now tell me what it is
that you're wearing.
- I wanted to show some leg,
but I wanted to still be cute
and not too--too much.
- Gorgeous.
Do you think
she's wearing panties?
- No.
- No Hollywood starlet does.
- [laughs]
- [gasps]
Is that Cher?
Oh, my God, that is Raven.
- You are the spitting image
of Anjelica Huston!
What is it you're wearing?
Give us the ensemble.
- The gown is by Vivian Wallace.
I lost a few beads,
but hopefully they'll end up
on the runaway,
and a couple of the girls
will fall on them.
- That beading is gorgeous.
I want that outfit.
It's very Angelina Jolie, right?
- Without the children.
- Yes, without the kids
or the Mickey D's.
What Bollywood star is this?
[gasps]
Jujubee.
- I feel wonderful, fabulous,
gorgeous, beautiful!
- Keep it coming,
keep it coming.
- You look gorgeous.
You know that.
- [gasps]
Oh!
She's not just dressed
for the red carpet.
She's wearing it.
- Who's--is that Beyonce?
- No. [gasps]
Oh, my goodness, it's Tyra.
- My dear,
how are you feeling tonight?
Are you having a good time?
- I'm feeling fabulous.
- Is there anything you'd like
to say to your fans?
- To my fans,
just keep dreaming,
and remember,
if you can't love yourself,
how in the hell are you gonna
love anybody else?
- Tyra. Ohh.
- It's kind of Rita Hayworth.
- It's very Rita Hayworth.
<i>Gilda.</i>
- Yes,<i> Gilda!</i>
- Welcome, ladies.
An acceptance speech
is an essential part
of any awards show.
And now, I want each of you
to share yours with the judges.
The Diva of the Year Award
goes to...
Tatianna.
- First off, thank you.
I want to start
by thanking my mother.
Without her,
I wouldn't be here today,
and without her genes,
I might not
have been here today.
I did me to the fullest.
And that is why I'm standing
here today accepting this award.
Thank you.
- Thank you, Tatianna.
- Thank you.
- The Diva of the Year Award
goes to...Raven.
- Oh!
[laughter]
[sniffling]
Thank you so much.
I, first of all,
have to thank God,
for without Him,
I would not be here.
I also have to thank RuPaul
for putting a fire
under my butt.
And I also have to thank
all of my fans
who have gotten me
to where I am today.
Thank you.
- Thank you, Raven.
- The Diva of the Year Award
goes to...
[drum roll]
Jujubee.
- [hyperventilating]
Thank you so much.
First and foremost,
I'd like to thank my Creator,
King Jesus and God Himself.
I'd like to thank my father
for just believing in me
and taking his time to teach me.
Mother, I know you're out there,
and I know you're watching.
It's okay.
One day, we'll be
back together again.
This is my diva moment,
and I am so glad
to share this moment with you.
Thank you so much.
- Thank you.
- [laughing]
- The Diva of the Year Award
goes to...
[drum roll]
Tyra Sanchez.
- Wow, I didn't even know
I was nominated.
[laughter]
First and foremost,
I have to dedicate my award
to my son.
It's you who make me smile.
It's you who keeps me going.
It's you who makes me motivated.
And I just want him to know
that if he believes,
all dreams will come true.
[whispers]
Thank you.
[feigning tears] I promised
myself I wouldn't cry.
[laughter]
[applause]
All right, now it's time
for the judges' critique.
Tatianna,
I want to start with you.
- Hello.
- Did you intentionally
do Sarah Palin?
- No, I wasn't intentionally
going for that,
but I do love her hair.
- Interestingly enough,
I think the sexiest
we've seen you look
was doing
the executive chic in D.C.
The fact that you're
hiding it a little
made you look more beautiful.
- I'm not in love
with the ruffle.
It's a little too big on top.
It's not coming off as,
like, a real garment for me.
- The red carpet, now,
that's where you got me.
Unfortunately, James St. James,
he's been holding a mic
a long time.
Or we don't know what he's
been holding, but what...
- [laughing]
Among other things.
- Among other things.
But he really got into that mic,
and he was like,
"So, what do you think?"
and you were like, "Well..."
- It did seem like you were
soft-spoken
and was lacking confidence.
- Hi, Raven.
- Hi.
- I have to say
I really do love this dress.
- It's actually sheer.
The beads cover your...
naughty parts.
- When you wear it,
you're of course
supposed to be a<i> real</i><span style="bodyStyle"> woman.</i>
- Oh, you mean
for a biological woman.
- [laughing]
A biological woman.
I'm a psychological woman.
- Oh, okay.
[laughter]
- But...
- You were giving me the first
woman four-star general.
It was very severe
and believable,
and I--I love that.
- I love it--a four-star general
with a pearl necklace.
- Yeah. [laughing]
- That's hot.
- Your backstage was, I think,
the best
out of the girls for me.
You were accessible,
you were funny.
- There are no small people,
just big bitches.
- Funny as that was,
then you turned around
and gave an acceptance speech
that was completely
from the heart.
So we got to see all the
different spectrum of you,
which we saw
in all the outfits too.
- Thank you.
- Jujubee.
- Hi.
- Your Diva Awards presentation.
You missed a few steps.
- Of course, you know, I--
I have two left feet.
- I was like,
"Oh, no, she's messing up."
But then you, like,
camped it up so much
that then I kind of couldn't
keep my eyes off of you.
You really recovered well.
And then this look, I did think,
"Oh, this is a costume.
"This isn't what someone
would really wear
to an awards ceremony."
- I thought what Juju
brought tonight
was nerve.
I thought it was very nervy.
to go with a hip-hop,
urban look
when it's not
what you would expect.
It was really
the only true surprise
that we saw.
- Then we got
your acceptance speech.
- Mother,
I know you're out there,
and I know you're watching.
It's okay.
One day,
we'll be back together again.
We all know I don't have
a relationship with my mother.
But she put me here on earth,
so I have to thank her.
- I can relate.
My dad wasn't there, uh,
for my, uh,
winning the Academy Award.
So--but he was busy and stuff,
so it's not like I
hold it against him.
But, so, but you know, you'd--
I was eight years old,
so you'd want someone there.
So I get it,
you know what I mean?
And--but I love that you had the
presence of mind to say that.
- Yes. Thank you.
- Thank you.
- Hi, Tyra.
- Hi.
- I've gotta tell you,
the fact that you've been here
all these weeks,
and you were able
to save this dress till now--
I just want to give you a
standing ovation for that alone.
- Thank you.
- Were there any other times
when you thought,
"Okay, I'm gonna wear
the ice green today?"
- Every time I would get ready
for a challenge,
I would see it,
and I'm thinking,
"It's not time; when it's time,
it'll call my name."
[laughter]
- And you're just
so impressive this week.
I love that plum cocktail dress.
I notice that you
covered the shoes.
You know, you just know
how to wear clothes.
- That was my favorite teen
outfit.
That dress was exactly right.
And then the hair
was so very editorial.
- Your acceptance speech,
it was,
I think, my favorite tonight.
I have seen a lot of growth
in your stage presence.
Your confidence, your calmness,
the way you spoke
was really there.
- Well, thank you, ladies.
While you enjoy
an Absolut cocktail
in the Interior
Illusions Lounge,
the judges and I
will deliberate.
You may leave the stage.
[car engine starts]
- All right,
here comes the hard part.
Let's start with Tatianna.
There's something about Tatianna
that feels unfinished,
like her dress.
Here's the thing:
when you've got a body
like Tatianna,
you don't have to do much.
If you're asked to bring
red carpet realness,
don't come in something
that's a little too slutty,
a little too obvious--
and homemade.
- But there was a positive about
her Washington, D.C., look.
- I thought that was
her best look,
because she wasn't
leaning on her looks.
She was bringing something else
to the table--
some thought and some fun.
- I think she has a spark.
Even her just
standing there smiling,
like, my eyes are drawn to her.
- Yes.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Like, there's no question
why she made it this far.
- She's gorgeous.
- Yes, she is gorgeous.
- But you've got people
who are dropping into character,
who are like, you know,
have got some,
like, really good,
off-the-cuff repartee,
so it isn't just
about a beautiful face.
- The real question is,
does Tatianna have what it takes
to be America's
next drag superstar?
- She got the beauty,
she got the body;
I don't believe
she has the personality
or the taste level
or the sassy humor.
- Let's go to Jujubee.
You know, Jujubee has this
intellect about her
that feels beyond
any of the girls in the room.
But she sometimes
relies on this sort of
"I perform for you"
type of character
that is sort of one-dimensional.
- No, I totally disagree.
I think she's an actress.
She's got some spunk about her.
Her minus: I think she made
a poor choice on her last dress.
I don't know if that's worth
being sent home for.
- Raven.
- I just was drawn to her,
just because she
seemed like somebody
who's worked very hard, who's--
who sort of gets it,
who is funny.
- Well, I've gotten to be a
bigger fan of Raven's
as the show's gone on.
Every week, the onion peels back
a little more.
- Yeah.
- And what you see
gets more interesting.
- It's so tough, 'cause I--
I mean, the same thing
that I love about Raven
is the thing
that could be her weakness,
and it's that hard edge.
- All right, now, Tyra.
- I loved her from the minute
that she walked on.
She just got me, man.
Like, I just really
looked at her,
and I was like, "Star, winner."
She does need
to work on her voice.
- She's gotten better,
and the speech she gave tonight
was funnier and softer than
anything else she's delivered.
- That's true.
I've never changed my voice.
I think people
hear me differently
when I'm in drag.
But I've never change my voice.
Never have.
- You have a very--
you know,
your voice matches you.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- He's 21.
I can't imagine going through...
this at 21.
And with a son, to say,
"I'm gonna do this"?
I think that shows more maturity
than anybody else on that stage,
being able to say,
"I have a child,
"I'm bringing him into this
amazing world
"and showing him
you can really do--
this is truly proving
you can do whatever you want."
All right, silence!
I have made my decision.
Bring back my girls.
Welcome back, ladies.
Now, awards are a funny thing.
We lie and say it's an honor
just to be nominated.
But deep down, we all want
to snatch that trophy.
And yet,
what matters in this world
is charisma, uniqueness,
nerve, and talent.
Based on that criteria,
I've made some decisions.
Raven...
you're safe.
- Thank you.
- You may leave the stage.
- Thank you.
- I'm top three.
I'm excited.
But I should have won.
- The winner of this week's
challenge is...
Tyra Sanchez.
[applause]
Congratulations.
You have won a feature photo
spread in<i> Paper</i><span style="bodyStyle"> magazine.</i>
You may leave the stage.
- I'm not satisfied
being in the top three.
My goal is to win.
- Jujubee...
Tatianna...
the two of you
are up for elimination.
- Once again,
I'm in the bottom two.
I'm so disappointed.
- When I hear
that I'm in the bottom two,
I'm not surprised.
I'm really just trying
to pull this out.
- Ladies,
this is your last chance
to impress me and save yourself
from elimination.
The time has come...
for you to lip-synch
for your life.
Good luck...
and don't fuck it up.
- I definitely had issues
with the lyrics.
The way Aretha Franklin
sings that song
is so difficult to lip-synch to.
[RuPaul laughing]
[applause]
- Ladies...
I've made my decision.
Jujubee...
Shante, you stay.
- [whispers]
Thank you.
I am in the final three.
Girl!
I was just like this,
like, gay boy with a dream.
You know?
- Tatianna...
you made this competition
fun and fresh and young.
And we all owe you
a debt of gratitude.
For that, I have just two words.
[tearful]
Thank you.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
- Now sashay away.
- Bye.
[applause]
And look at my skirt.
It's short as hell.
[laughter]
Ha ha!
[laughing]
Bye.
You know, to the people who said
that I wasn't drag enough,
just because
I have natural beauty
doesn't mean
I'm not a drag queen.
I didn't have to put on pounds
of makeup to be pretty.
I think that bothered
some people here,
but that's their issue.
I know what I've got.
I know that I am a drag queen,
and one of the top drag queens,
thank you very much.
- And then there were three.
We are fast approaching
the finish line
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
Tyra, Jujubee, Raven.
Next week, one of you will be
crowned the next drag superstar.
Until then, remember:
If you can't love yourself,
how in the hell
you gonna love somebody else?
Can I get an amen in here?
- all: Amen.
- All right,
now let the music play.
[cheers and applause]
[laughter]


-<i> Previously</i>
<i>on</i><span style="bodyStyle"> RuPaul's Drag Race...</i>
Reading is fundamental.
- My new book is going
to hit stores soon.
It's called<i> Young, Broke,</i>
<i>and Fabulous.</i>
- Tatianna, thank you
for being here.
- Thank you, and let me tell you
about this beverage.
- Uh, good luck.
- Fuck.
- I'm a little worried
about your confidence level.
- If you're gonna look
like a coke whore,
take the joke even further.
- Raven, you are the winner
of this week's challenge.
Two queens stand before me.
Tatianna, shantay you stay.
- Are you playing with me?
- Jessica, sashay away.
- Thank you from the bottom
of my heart.
-<i> And tonight...</i>
"Which one of you bitches
is my drag mother?"
<i>The dolls get a challenge</i>
<i>for the ages.</i>
- Whoa, Jesus.
- I've got a safety pin.
I thought, like, a low cut.
-<i> And a real life lesson...</i>
- Oh, I had dreams about this.
- I think that my drag mother
hit on me.
-<i> With extra special</i>
<i>guest judges</i>
<i>Cloris Leachman</i>
<i>and Debbie Reynolds</i>
<i>And NYX Cosmetics' Toni Ko.</i>
<i>The winner</i>
<i>of</i><span style="bodyStyle"> RuPaul's Drag Race</i>
<i>will receive a lifetime supply</i>
<i>of NYX Cosmetics</i>
<i>and be the face</i>
<i>of nyxcosmetics.com;</i>
<i>an exclusive one-year</i>
<i>PR contract</i>
<i>with the leading LGBT firm,</i>
<i>Project Publicity;</i>
<i>be featured in l.a.Eyeworks'</i>
<i>legendary designer eyewear</i>
<i>campaign</i>
<i>and headline</i>
<i>Logo's</i><span style="bodyStyle"> Drag Race</i><i> tour</i>
<i>featuring exceptional</i>
<i>Absolut drinks;</i>
<i>and a cash prize of $25,000.</i>
And may the best woman win!
[alarm blaring]
-<i> [groaning]</i>
Oh, I cannot handle
your weight.
-<i> There's only five of us left.</i>
<i>Jessica was the last one to go.</i>
And it's kind of sad
because we all liked Jessica.
- Oh,<i> mira, mira!</i>
"I love you girls.
<i>Viva Puerto Rico!"</i>
I miss Jessica, but I still have
my girl Tatianna.
You know, most people here
don't agree with that situation.
- Aw, Jessica.
- I honestly thought she was
gonna be, like,
in the top three.
<i>- Me too.</i>
<i>- I thought so too.</i>
- People are upset
that Tatianna's still here.
<i>And I was shocked too.</i>
<i>I was like, "Wow,</i>
Jessica's sending Tatianna
home tonight."
- But that's not the case.
Raven loves to hear
her own voice.
- Why did you look at Ru
and go, "Really?"
- 'Cause I wasn't expecting
to be safe.
- So do you think
you shouldn't be here?
- No, I don't think
I shouldn't be here.
I just wasn't expecting
to be safe.
- But you questioned it.
- I was just pretty shocked.
[laughs]
- That lack of confidence,
that's not a superstar.
<i>Questioning yourself</i>
<i>is gonna make them go,</i>
"Okay, does she really not think
that she's that good
to be here?"
- Honestly,
I'm a little tired
of having to defend
my confidence
or my want to be here.
I could give two fucks less
what anyone has to say.
- How do you all feel
about the judges?
- Yeah, I love the judges too.
<i>I feel like I have gotten</i>
<i>some mixed messages.</i>
They want me funny,
but they want me glamorous,
but they don't,
and then they do.
He said to me, "I don't like
your style at all."
<i>Like, where do you go</i>
<i>from there?</i>
How am I ever gonna impress him
if he doesn't like my style?
[alarm sounds]
-<i> Ooh, girl, you got shemail.</i>
You know, a famous beauty
once said,
"After age 40,
a woman must choose
between her face and her ass."
Well, clearly this bitch
never met a drag queen.
Youth may be wasted
on the young,
but trust me, you want to be
the next drag superstar,
well, your future is staring
at you right in the face.
[engine roaring]
- Do we have to wear
a fat suit?
- Something about babies
and old people and...
- Maybe we're gonna go in
for surgery
to get our ovaries removed.
- Hello, hello, hello!
all: Hi!
- My babies,
look how far you've come.
<i>Today your mini challenge</i>
<i>is all about</i>
<i>your beautiful baby faces.</i>
In a moment, you'll have
to match this season's 12 queens
with their baby pictures.
The one who makes
the most matches
in the least amount of time
wins.
<i>Raven, are you ready?</i>
-<i> Yep.</i>
-<i> Ladyboy, baby boy, go!</i>
- All right. Yes.
Oh!
<i>I see a little tiny baby</i>
<i>and a big ol' Mystique face</i>
<i>on it just looking up like,</i>
"How you doin'?"
Done.
-<i> There is definitely</i>
<i>an urgency</i>
<i>with me wanting to win</i>
<i>this mini challenge</i>
<i>just because I had</i>
<i>such a rough night</i>
having to lip-sync for my life.
-<i> Every second counts.</i>
<i>And where is the Puerto Rican?</i>
- [laughing]
What the fuck is that?
- Now, you all did a great job.
<i>I want to reveal</i>
<i>the correct matches.</i>
<i>This is of course,</i>
<i>Nicole Paige Brooks.</i>
<i>Morgan McMichaels.</i>
<i>Sahara Davenport.</i>
<i>And look at this</i>
<i>little lady here.</i>
<i>Remember her?</i>
<i>- Shangela.</i>
<i>- That's right.</i>
Is that my little buddy
next to her right there?
- Oh, I thought that was Chucky.
-<i> That's Sonique.</i>
<i>This little laddie, Tatianna.</i>
- Yes.
<i>all: Pandora Boxx.</i>
<i>- Jessica Wild.</i>
- Doing nudes as a baby.
Oh, and look here.
-<i> Aww, Jujubee.</i>
<i>- The other Tyra.</i>
<i>- The other Tyra.</i>
And this, of course,
is baby Mystique.
Now, I have to explain this.
Mystique lost all of her
family photos in a fire.
Now, Tyra, you got 12 right
in 57 seconds.
Jujubee, you only got ten right,
and it took a minute
and 33 seconds.
Pandora, you got 12 right
in a minute and 24 seconds.
<i>So Tyra's still ahead.</i>
Raven, you also got 12 right
in one minute and six seconds.
- Oh, damn.
- And, Tatianna, you got
12 right in...
51 seconds.
Congratulations.
You won the baby face
mini challenge.
Now for today's main challenge.
<i>Life goes by so quickly.</i>
Before you know it,
you're a golden girl.
This week, you're gonna get
a chance to grow old gracefully.
<i>I have some special guests</i>
<i>I want you to meet.</i>
<i>Welcome, gentlemen.</i>
Please, introduce yourselves.
- I'm Michael, a writer.
- Edward, I'm a displaced
mortgage accountant.
- Don, retired teacher
and filmmaker.
- Dustin, former
ballroom dance instructor.
- Steven May, owner
of a real estate brokerage.
- Welcome.
- Hi.
- I was just like,
"Oh, what are we doing?"
-<i> Now, we are lucky</i>
<i>to live in a time</i>
where we can be more open
and honest than ever before.
And we have these men
and their generation to thank.
<i>Now it's your chance</i>
<i>to show your gratitude</i>
by making them fabulous.
-<i> Oh, no!</i>
We are going to have to put
old men in drag.
-<i> For your main challenge,</i>
<i>you'll transform</i>
<i>these silver daddies</i>
<i>into your drag mamas.</i>
It's a NYX Cosmetics
golden girl makeover.
And, ladies, I expect to see
a definite family resemblance.
<i>In addition</i>
<i>to your NYX Cosmetics,</i>
<i>you can use your own drag</i>
plus shoes
from Le Dame Footwear
<i>and wigs courtesy</i>
<i>of Wig Pro Collection.</i>
Don't hold back, because this
is your mama we talkin' about.
<i>Tatianna, as the baby face</i>
<i>mini challenge winner,</i>
<i>you get to pick first.</i>
Take a closer look.
You can look at the teeth.
- Smile.
[laughter]
-<i> Yeah, look at all of them.</i>
"Which one of you bitches
is my drag mother?"
All right.
-<i> Of course, Tatianna goes up</i>
and picks the one
that I knew she'd pick:
the pretty one.
-<i> Tatianna, you're not done yet.</i>
Now you get to pair
the other queens
<i>with their drag mama.</i>
-<i> Oh, shit, I'm gonna get</i>
<i>one of these two bastards</i>
<i>at the end.</i>
<i>She's giving me</i>
<i>one of those two.</i>
<i>- Hi, Mama.</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>
- How are you?
-<i> So sweet.</i>
-<i> Juju did whisper to me</i>
<i>who she wanted,</i>
and that's my girl.
<i>Everyone else I just kind of</i>
<i>was like, "You here."</i>
- Mom!
-<i> The Boxxes.</i>
-<i> You here.</i>
-<i> Aw, isn't that sweet?</i>
<i>Dustin Sanchez.</i>
- I did consciously
leave Raven for last.
Steven, you're the mother
of Raven.
- Oh, how sweet!
- Hi, Mommy.
-<i> Aw, that's gorgeous!</i>
- Sure enough,
the last one I get,
the one with the full
fucking facial hair.
<i>I'm like, "Okay, bitch,</i>
<i>you watch.</i>
I'll turn
this motherfucker out."
- Now, I need you to show me
that charisma, uniqueness,
nerve, and talent
runs in the family.
Now, I'm gonna leave you
to have
a little mother-daughter
bonding time,
and I'll be back
a little bit later.
Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best "womens" win.
-<i> Do you got a walk?</i>
- I don't know how to do a walk.
- Come on, it's one, two--
- Oh, wait.
- In early gay liberation,
I did what we called skag drag.
Gender fuck.
You know, where we, like,
wear combat boots
and frilly dresses.
- I see a fierce diva
in my drag mother.
So I think that Tatianna
did a good job pairing me up.
Thank you, Tatianna.
Tss.
- This is, like,
3/4 of an inch taller,
and that's just enough to send
me into the orthopedic ward.
You know what I'm saying,
darling?
- Yes.
So Michael, um,
does have a limp.
- Whoa, Jesus.
-<i> I think</i>
<i>some of the other girls</i>
<i>might think I made</i>
<i>a bad decision choosing Michael</i>
because of his leg.
- Mm-hmm.
- But, um, who cares?
- Ouch! No way.
- Really?
- This is gonna take some work.
- Oh, man.
- I'm so excited!
The main challenge is gonna be
us turning these fabulous men
into our drag mother.
- I've got a safety pin
and I've got a spear.
I-I wear all kinds of junk
in here.
I-I put in all this stuff
for today.
- Wow.
- I thought maybe you'd do
something interesting with it,
like a low cut.
I wanted to give you
that option.
- Thank you for the option,
but we're gonna cover that up.
We're not--we're not gonna
show that off.
<i>My mother's gonna be</i>
<i>sexy conservative,</i>
fierce, confident,
and beautiful.
- I had a very interesting
experience
of being a part
of early gay liberation.
So I know what life is like
being in the closet
and out of the closet.
-<i> The point of this challenge,</i>
<i>I think,</i>
<i>is respecting your elders,</i>
respecting people
who have fought for you.
<i>At the same time, encouraging</i>
<i>and helping someone else</i>
to be as fierce as you are.
And my mother will not
be bearded.
- [laughs]
- Just don't think of, um,
the little Chihuahua
and the master.
That--no, no.
But if you want to do
master and slave,
that could work too.
If I want to be master...
- He's a little bit
of a dirty man.
- Oh, I had dreams about this.
- And I think that my
drag mother hit on me.
- It looks older
than I want to look.
No.
See, if we could get an
attractive-shaped one of these,
it would make my face
look a little thinner.
-<i> I think bigger hair</i>
<i>would make your face</i>
<i>a little thinner, though.</i>
- But didn't you see those,
though, on me?
It was just like...
- No, but you have--
just trust me.
I've been doing drag too long
to know that a flat wig
is gonna help out a big face.
- 'Cause what I was thinking--
- Were you not listening to me,
Mom?
- No!
- Just shh.
- I am a challenge.
- Michael is very theatrical.
- Because I've had a number of,
uh, injuries and health issues
that have caused my body
to look kind of beat up,
like I told you.
And that is your job,
to fix me up.
- Transforming someone older,
the face is a little bit harder
to transform.
The body may be a little bit
harder to transform.
Obviously, the skin
isn't as smooth and taut
as it is when you're younger.
- You're lucky 'cause I don't
have to shave here.
- You already take care of this?
- No, I don't have any.
- Oh, you just had it removed?
- No, it just fell out.
- Oh.
- Hello, hello, hello!
<i>Hi.</i>
Ooh, these gorgeous wigs.
How's it going out
with your new mommy?
- It's Contessa Touché.
- Contessa Touché.
- Mm-hmm.
- Wow, I love that.
<i>What do you have planned</i>
<i>for your drag mother's outfit?</i>
- She wants to just look
really elegant.
- Uh-huh.
- And she doesn't want to look
too old.
- Or too fat.
-<i> Really, the only</i>
<i>challenging thing with Contessa</i>
at the moment
is her confidence level.
- All right, carry on.
Hi, Raven.
- Hello.
- Hi, Steven. How are you?
- Hi, Ru.
- Does Steven
have a drag name yet?
- It's Golda Lamé.
- Golda Lamé.
Now, now, you know that this
is your challenge.
You will be judged
on this challenge.
- Yes.
Tatianna picked me last.
She thinks she's being cunty
by giving me someone
who had a full facial beard
and is a little older-looking.
I'm gonna turn it out
and show her,
"No, bitch, you didn't get it."
- All right, well, bring it.
- It's been broughten, honey T.
[laughter]
<i>My drag mother,</i>
<i>if she was a woman,</i>
would take her bra off, burn it,
never wear a high heel
in her life,
have a bush this big.
We're gonna dip her in Nair
and pull her out
and get her dressed.
- You got a lot of work to do,
so good luck.
- Thank you.
- Hello.
- Hey, Ru.
- Well, well, well.
What's going on?
- I'm already nervous
<i>because I've never done</i>
<i>anyone else's makeup.</i>
So I'm kind of scared.
I don't know how to do it,
<i>'cause I hate</i>
<i>doing my own face.</i>
- You do?
- I don't like doing makeup.
Like, I would rather sit there
and have someone do it.
- You know, you got
a lot of work cut out for you
and not a lot of time.
- Okay.
- Thank you.
<i>All right, Tatianna.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
- Hello.
- Why did you pick Michael
as your drag mama?
- Face and eyes.
- And you got to assign
all the other queens
to their drag mothers.
- Mm-hmm.
- What was your strategy?
- I really didn't have one.
-<i> You didn't have a strategy?</i>
- I really didn't have one.
- Well, Raven believes that, uh,
you chose her drag mother
because she had a beard.
- No, I mean,
you can shave a beard.
- Because, you know,
if you had,
that would've been
really fierce.
- There was a slight strategy,
but I'm not trying
to announce it to the room.
- All right, Tatianna, who uses
no strategy as her strategy,
<i>good luck.</i>
- Thank you.
-<i> Pandora Boxx.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
- Hello.
- And Mrs. Boxx.
- Just call me Litter.
-<i> Oh, I love that.</i>
Pandora and Litter Boxx.
- Yes.
- The umbilical cord
is still attached.
- Oh, dear!
<i>Yes, that's--that's, I think,</i>
illegal in 40 of the 50 states.
- I think it is, yes.
- Would you like to demonstrate
your walk?
- Do I have to keep
my clothes on?
- You can keep your clothes on.
- I didn't want to.
- Do it as if you were
stark naked.
Yes, show us
what you're working with.
<i>Oh, okay.</i>
Mama Litter.
Well, keep on keeping on.
See you, Miss Litter.
- See you.
-<i> All right, gather around,</i>
<i>ladies.</i>
Tomorrow,
our special guest judges
<i>will include founder and CEO</i>
of NYX cosmetics, Toni Ko,
plus two legendary
Hollywood stars--
<i>the academy award-winning</i>
<i>actress Cloris Leachman...</i>
- Oh!
-<i> Cloris is also providing you</i>
<i>with clothes</i>
from her Clorisline collection.
<i>And last but certainly</i>
<i>not least,</i>
<i>the unsinkable</i>
<i>Miss Debbie Reynolds</i>
<i>will be here.</i>
[laughter and applause]
-<i> My mother is so excited.</i>
She's like, "Oh, my God,
I love her, oh, my God!"
<i>I'm like, "Yes,</i>
<i>you see that excitement</i>
<i>"that you have for those girls?</i>
Now we need to put that
into our performance."
- Oh, and one more thing.
Tomorrow, in addition to your
fierce runway presentation,
you must perform a lip-sync duet
with your drag mother
to my song<i> Main Event.</i>
-<i> Oh, my God.</i>
How much more can we do
in this one challenge?
I want to cry.
-<i> Now, good luck,</i>
<i>and as Mama used to say,</i>
"Don't fuck it up."
-<i> Your mama workin' it out?</i>
- Oh, she is. She is.
-<i> She workin' you out?</i>
- She's teaching me
a new dance.
- I just want to see.
- I wanted the blue one.
- Cloris Leachman
is providing us
<i>with her own clothing line,</i>
<i>called Clorisline.</i>
<i>And it's probably a good idea</i>
<i>to incorporate</i>
something in that
since she's a judge.
- Mama, look what I got you.
- Your homework is to shave,
shave, shave, shave.
<i>The challenge for today is,</i>
we got a group
of older gentlemen
which we are to transform
into our drag mothers.
A lot of shaving.
- I guess it grew back.
- Just a little.
[laughs]
The twist is that we have to do
a mother-daughter lip-sync.
- I yelled at my mother,
and look,
she's on the couch with her
heels on learning the song.
I said, "Bitch,
you better listen
to that shit ten times."
- It's supposed to be
a mother-daughter, right?
So I'm dividing it up
between the two of us.
-<i> I know that Michael</i>
<i>has ideas,</i>
and he's definitely
making them known,
<i>but, you know,</i>
<i>when it comes down to it,</i>
<i>I'm the one</i>
<i>that would be sent home,</i>
so I have to really get
my vision out there.
My style of performing is,
I don't have a plan.
- No plan?
- When I'm by myself,
I have no plan.
- I'm confused
about whose line is what.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
<i>Um, where's mine?</i>
<i>'Cause I just wrote it down.</i>
Let me find--
Do you--
- No, not me.
- Okay.
- Tatianna's mom looks
really pissed off.
- [sighs]
- Uh-uh, more attitude.
Do the hip.
The time has come for us to do
the runway and rehearse, honey.
We only have 20 minutes.
Hold your head up high,
miss honey.
And then right up here,
we gonna stop,
flirt, kind of rub yourself
a little bit like this, right?
<i>Pretend you're Celine Dion.</i>
Do you feel sexy?
Confidence.
- Uhh...
- Without confidence,
we're Tatianna.
- We both have a similar idea
of what we want to do.
- Michael was definitely
telling me
<i>about how he used to work</i>
<i>at a disco.</i>
So he really felt a connection
to the music.
<i>I did so poorly last challenge,</i>
and I really want
to make that up to the judges
<i>and make them see</i>
<i>that they kept me for a reason.</i>
I'm happy!
- Good.
- I'm just trying
to figure out clothes.
And it's really because
they haven't liked
a lot of stuff
that I've done on the runway
that I'm like, "Okay."
Just staring at my wardrobe,
thinking,
"What the fuck
am I gonna do?"
- Is this supposed
to be incorporated
into what you're creating?
- We can, we don't have to,
but I really want it to be fun
and, like, a little
over-the-top.
We are gonna be judged on
how well we transfer my essence,
<i>the essence of Pandora.</i>
<i>So if my essence</i>
<i>is bad fashion,</i>
then my mom's gettin'
bad fashion too.
-<i> Rub it in.</i>
Like, caressing your own body
and then just shoot it
out of your fingertips.
Just really extend your fingers.
- My drag mother and I
are going to do
a little cha-cha
that she taught me,
<i>and the reason is because</i>
<i>when we're onstage,</i>
<i>the judges are going to see me</i>
<i>and my drag mother.</i>
So I want them to see a part
of my drag mother in me.
Four, um, two, three--
-<i> Oh, this is the dance.</i>
Yeah, so it was two, three,
four, and one.
See, I've changed
the choreography already.
-<i> While rehearsing</i>
<i>with my drag mother,</i>
<i>every time she would start</i>
<i>over, she would change it.</i>
I'm a little scared.
<i>I don't have much time</i>
<i>to learn,</i>
and I don't want him
to mess up either
because he'll be dancing
in heels.
We probably need
to try that again.
- Have you ever put on
panty hose before?
- No.
- Can you do a running
back handspring?
So we get out
onto the main stage
for our 20 minutes of rehearsal.
<i>My drag mom has bad eyes.</i>
So I can see her standing there
and kind of, like, looking like,
"Where are you?"
<i>as I walk out there,</i>
<i>and I know that the lights</i>
<i>are gonna be even brighter,</i>
<i>so I'm like, "This bitch</i>
is not gonna be able to see
what she's doing."
Try walking by yourself.
You're so dainty about it.
[laughter]
Stop.
Put your hand on your hip
and then turn.
- Turn.
- All the way around.
- Okay.
- And then walk back.
<i>So I'm like,</i>
<i>"Okay, stand there.</i>
<i>"Basically you follow my lead.</i>
"Do what I do.
<i>Don't fall off the stage."</i>
<i>And just stay there, yeah.</i>
And then bring your hand down.
Put it over your heart.
<i>She needs direction.</i>
<i>Like, she needs you to say,</i>
<i>"This is where we're going.</i>
<i>"This is when we're walking.</i>
This is what we're doing."
Turn. Walk toward each other.
Is that too much for you?
- No, it's okay.
- Okay, so go to that corner
over there.
So I'm hoping she doesn't fall
or break something.
<i>Pretty easy, right?</i>
- Uh, no.
This is a lot to learn.
-<i> We literally only had</i>
<i>about ten minutes</i>
<i>to hear the song before.</i>
<i>The lip-sync isn't down</i>
<i>for either of us.</i>
I mean, I don't know the song,
my drag mother
doesn't know the song,
but really, it's rehearsal time,
so we have to go through
the choreography.
And then this is where
I'll pose,
and you do something
a little dirty.
- Creating a monster.
- I think I am.
<i>I think I've created a monster.</i>
Back, Litter Boxx.
Back to your spot.
-<i> My mother's hairy.</i>
My mother has hairy arms,
hairy knuckles,
hairy back, and that beard
is going buh-bye.
- Raven's, uh, grooming.
- Beauty salon.
I had to shave
my fucking mother.
So you're done, Mama.
- Thank you, daughter.
- How do you feel, Mama?
- The performance
is gonna be difficult.
I wasn't expecting that.
I don't know
if I'm gonna be able
to memorize all these lyrics.
- I'm gonna go sit down.
I'm exhausted.
- Yeah, go ahead.
-<i> None of these bitches</i>
<i>better die overnight.</i>
They better not.
Gonna come back tomorrow,
"Your mother died last night."
- [laughing]
- Morning.
- Hello.
- Well, it's your day of beauty,
Mother.
- So today our challenge is,
we have to turn
a 60-year-old man
<i>into our drag mother.</i>
<i>They need to embody</i>
<i>our persona,</i>
<i>and they have to perform</i>
<i>with us a lip-sync</i>
to<i> Main Event</i><span style="bodyStyle"> by RuPaul.</i>
Are you excited for today?
- Yeah.
I'll be more excited
when I find out that you stay.
-<i> It's definitely odd</i>
<i>to be bonding</i>
<i>with someone twice my age,</i>
but I already feel very close
to my drag mom.
- It's nerve-racking.
- It is.
- [laughs]
- I've never had a drag mother
before.
I'm so happy.
- It might be easier,
because, you know,
you might get makeup on it
if you take it off after.
- Oh.
- Oh, God.
<i>My drag mother, Litter Boxx,</i>
has arrived in a red, white,
and blue bikini.
- You blowin' me?
- All I thought is,
"Just do the makeup.
"Just do the makeup.
<i>"Do the makeup, Pandora.</i>
<i>Don't look."</i>
- Who is Oscar Wilde?
- I went--who is Oscar Wilde?
Who is Oscar Wilde?
- Oh, my gosh, are you serious?
-<i> Who is Oscar Wilde?</i>
- That's no homosexual
over there.
- We are here to educate
the young.
- She told me, and I was like,
"Great, fantastic."
- There is a pantheon
one should learn.
- Look straight up
at the ceiling.
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, I'm sure he knows
Harvey Milk with all the--
- Yes.
- Can y'all stop talking to her?
'Cause she needs to close
her eyes.
- Okay.
- Well, he can close his eyes
and talk at the same time.
- Well, obviously she can't,
because she's opening her eyes.
I was just like, "Mom,
get your shit together!"
-<i> I'm just a little worried</i>
<i>about the time constraint,</i>
getting not only myself
but Annalisha ready too.
- And then pull that up.
<i>I'm getting my mom dressed,</i>
and I realized that Mom
doesn't have the body
that I need Mom to have.
[duct tape ripping]
<i>So I took duct tape and I put</i>
<i>duct tape all around Mom</i>
just to give her the hips
that she needed
and that she deserved.
- No, I'm not.
- [laughs]
- [laughing]
Hello, judges.
<i>- Hey, Ru.</i>
<i>- Hello, Ru.</i>
- Well, well, well,
<i>Cloris Leachman, darling,</i>
<i>how are you?</i>
- Excellent, thank you.
- Santino, how are you tonight?
- You are making a spectacle
of yourself, Ru.
- Really?
- And I love it. I love it.
- Merle, what about you?
How are you doing?
- I am just freaking out
over my fine feathered friend.
- Aw, you're sweet.
<i>Debbie Reynolds, you are</i>
and you will always be
America's sweetheart.
<i>Thank you for being here.</i>
- Thank you for having me here.
- Toni Ko, you're finally here.
- How are you?
-<i> The girls love NYX Cosmetics.</i>
<i>It's fantastic!</i>
Well, we have a show for you
tonight.
This week, our ladies
were challenged
to transform a silver fox
into a golden girl.
<i>Are you ready for a little</i>
<i>mother-daughter fashion show?</i>
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win!
This is Raven and her
drag mother, Golda Lamé.
-<i> She's totally freaked out</i>
<i>about walking.</i>
<i>I just was very nervous</i>
<i>that she was gonna fall.</i>
<i>I mean, doesn't walk in heels,</i>
<i>but she's sparkling,</i>
<i>and she's loving it.</i>
-<i> Mama mia!</i>
[laughter]
<i>A cougar and her cub.</i>
<i>Pandora Boxx and her</i>
<i>drag mother, Litter Boxx.</i>
<i>This is the Boxx family.</i>
- And she's gonna show us
her box later?
[laughter]
- Oh, dear God.
-<i> I'm feeling really good</i>
<i>about our outfits.</i>
<i>They're kind of, like,</i>
<i>you know, showgirl today,</i>
<i>showgirl yesterday.</i>
<i>There's sense of comedy</i>
<i>about it.</i>
-<i> It's 10:00.</i>
<i>Do you know where your</i>
<i>drag mother is?</i>
<i>This is Jujubee</i>
<i>and the Contessa Touché.</i>
-<i> My drag mother</i>
<i>is feeling spectacular.</i>
<i>She has stepped</i>
<i>into the boundary of Jujubee,</i>
<i>and she feels wonderful.</i>
-<i> "I'm pretty, Mama.</i>
<i>I'm a pretty girl."</i>
<i>Tatianna and her drag mother,</i>
<i>Annalisha.</i>
-<i> My drag mother</i>
<i>does have a limp,</i>
<i>but, um, she's pushing</i>
<i>through it,</i>
<i>and she's not letting it</i>
<i>stop her.</i>
[laughter]
- No, you are gonna phone me
later.
<i>- Tyra Sanchez and her mother,</i>
<i>Big Tyra.</i>
-<i> My drag mother was having</i>
<i>a very good time on the runway.</i>
<i>She has the attitude,</i>
<i>she has the walk,</i>
<i>and she has the smile.</i>
<i>She was very comfortable</i>
<i>and confident in drag.</i>
-<i> The apple bottom don't fall</i>
<i>far from the tree.</i>
[laughter]
- It's time for our mothers
and daughters
to make their performance debut.
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the main event!
[laughter]
-<i> It's so important to have</i>
<i>a little trick up your sleeve,</i>
especially at this point
in the game.
Whoo!
-<i> My drag mother's funny,</i>
<i>and we had a good rapport.</i>
<i>We're having fun, we're campy,</i>
<i>and I'm thinking</i>
<i>that I'm giving the judges</i>
what they want.
-<i> I wasn't nervous at all</i>
<i>because we rehearsed it</i>
and we were very confident
in our routine.
<i>She just let loose,</i>
<i>and she wowed the judges</i>
<i>and put a smile</i>
<i>on everyone's face.</i>
And so I thought it went great.
-<i> After we've run through it,</i>
<i>you know, a million times,</i>
<i>and she freezes kind of,</i>
<i>and I'm like,</i>
<i>"Mom, my place</i>
<i>in the competition</i>
<i>is on the line</i>
<i>if we don't get this right."</i>
And it looks messy.
Go, mamas! Go!
-<i> I can tell</i>
<i>she's getting tired.</i>
And I can sense, like,
she's not gonna make it back.
<i>So as the music ends,</i>
<i>I grab her and take her</i>
<i>to the back.</i>
-<i> Yay!</i>
[cheers and applause]
- 'Cause, I mean,
I would do that for my mom.
-<i> Gorgeous!</i>
- Will they do that for me
when I leave here?
- Yes, they will, absolutely.
- Thank you. That'd be good.
-<i> Hello, ladies.</i>
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
the next generation.
I'm having a senior moment...
and I'm loving it!
Raven, let's start with you.
- This is Ms. Golda Lamé.
- Let's take a look
at your drag mother before.
<i>Ooh!</i>
<i>- Wow!</i>
- We used a dark brown
eye shadow.
We didn't want to use pencil
because it looks a little harsh.
- I can see that you're wearing
the exact same makeup.
- I am.
- You guys coordinate
without matching too much,
<i>and it works</i>
<i>for both body types.</i>
- Your lip-sync
was very, very good too,
which I noticed right away,
because in films,
that's what we always did.
I mean, people thought
we were really singing.
Well, we did sing, but we had
to then sing to our record,
so it's not easy
to lip-sync correctly,
<i>and you did a super job.</i>
<i>And I've never seen anybody</i>
<i>quite dance like the mother.</i>
You won't give Ginger Rogers
any contest, you know?
[laughter]
- Raven, is there anything
you want to say?
- Thank you for this experience
and for allowing me to work
with Steven.
I respect Steven so much
because he did a lot
as far as the gay rights
liberation.
I thank you.
- Thank you.
-<i> Aw!</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
[applause]
- It's because
of people like Steven
that we are able
to do this show.
Pandora Boxx, please introduce
your drag mother.
- This is my drag mother,
Litter Boxx.
-<i> Aw!</i>
Hi, Litter.
Welcome.
Now, Pandora, your drag mother
also has a reputation
for being a nudist.
- It's a lot easier
being a nudist
than it is being a drag queen.
- I agree.
[laughter]
- Is she wearing her Clorisline
panties underneath the outfit?
- She is--I hope she's wearing
some panties.
- Now let's take a look
at your drag mother before.
<i>Wow.</i>
-<i> I wanted her to look like</i>
<i>a more mature version of me.</i>
I wanted to do a softer liner.
- You look like me!
- I thought so too!
- I love the high energy
and the comedy,
and I love Mom coming out
and giving us attitude
<i>and you pulling her back like,</i>
<i>"Oh, I'm so embarrassed."</i>
- Mom was wanting to shine
and give more and more,
and you were kind of
pulling her back,
and that was--
- Had the mother been drinking?
[laughter]
- Jujubee.
- This is my mother,
Contessa Touché.
-<i> Oh, wow.</i>
-<i> We're going</i>
<i>for the natural look.</i>
-<i> Yes, of course.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
- Of course.
I did do a little eye shadow
to just kind of cut
into the cheek,
down the rims of the nose.
I used my Ru glue
to cover the eyebrows.
- I really wish Mama
would have had a longer do.
- The one thing that I thought
you did too much of was,
<i>your mouth was open so wide,</i>
<i>and all the words--</i>
<i>lip-syncing, you don't need</i>
<i>to do that.</i>
- Mama's lip-sync kind of
fell apart in a couple places.
- Tatianna.
- This is Annalisha.
<i>- Ooh!</i>
<i>- Wow!</i>
-<i> We actually used a little bit</i>
<i>of, like, a red lipstick</i>
<i>to counteract the beard color.</i>
I used the pink blush
on the apples of the cheek
<i>just to give a little flush.</i>
- I would've used
a brighter color lips.
- Older ladies do not wear
dark brown lips
unless they're Judy Davis.
-<i> I thought your lip-sync</i>
<i>was very good.</i>
The walker killed me.
I loved it a lot.
- Your facial expression too,
I loved it.
<i>I thought it added</i>
<i>to the whole performance.</i>
- You were really funny.
- Thank you.
- Tyra Sanchez.
- My drag mother's name
is Tyra,
which makes me
the other Tyra.
- That's right.
-<i> Oh!</i>
-<i> I mixed a couple</i>
<i>of the colors together</i>
<i>to get her skin color,</i>
and then I took
some of the blush
<i>and I put just a little</i>
<i>on her cheeks,</i>
<i>and I put, like, a nice</i>
<i>metallic silver onto her bone</i>
to make her eyes stand out
a little bit more.
- There's a lot of fun
in that hair.
<i>Your style translated</i>
<i>onto your mother.</i>
You're the only one who really
did identical outfits.
-<i> I should've known you'd have</i>
a classy Park Avenue
fashionable mother.
<i>On Mom, though, I might have</i>
<i>toned the lip down.</i>
<i>The makeup's a little heavy.</i>
- Now, Debbie Reynolds
is quite the hoofer.
- I knew you'd--I knew
she'd pick right up on that.
<i>The dancing,</i>
<i>it was exceptional,</i>
<i>choreography, the stage work.</i>
<i>The mother, with the hair,</i>
<i>could've been a little less,</i>
but then, you know, uh,
that's the kick of it.
- Thank you, ladies.
Now, while you enjoy
an Absolut cocktail
<i>in the Interior Illusions</i>
<i>Lounge,</i>
the judges and I
will deliberate.
[engine starting]
All right, just between
us girls.
<i>First up, we had Raven.</i>
- Raven did a great job
with the transformation.
Her mother did look like Raven.
-<i> She did have</i>
<i>the essence of Raven.</i>
What really carried the day
for me
is that Raven seemed
so protective of her mother,
<i>who's a tiny little person</i>
<i>who couldn't walk in heels,</i>
and we haven't seen that many
sweet sides to Raven,
<i>and the mother brought out</i>
<i>the sweetness in her.</i>
- You just kind of really felt
a kinship growing.
It's gonna be
a buddy system there.
- That's what we're about here
at<i> RuPaul's Drag Race:</i>
putting families together.
<i>Pandora Boxx and her mother.</i>
- Pandora's mother, Litter Boxx,
<i>actually was funnier</i>
<i>and kind of stole the show.</i>
- And I thought the mother
was really playing a part too.
She was playing the tough mama.
- Her mother kind of
showed her up a little bit.
-<i> Jujubee.</i>
Cloris, you commented
that her mouth was just open.
She was doing the old trick,
<i>"Peas and carrots," you know,</i>
<i>when you don't know the words?</i>
- It put me off
because it was so exaggerated
<i>that it wasn't real.</i>
- Well, that's what I'm looking
for in my drag queens:
realness.
- They both look very beautiful
and exotic,
but I just did not like
that hair.
-<i> Tatianna.</i>
- I had so many other things
written on other people
that I only have "wheelchair"
written there,
<i>and if you can make anything</i>
<i>out of that...</i>
[laughter]
And wonderful design, I think,
of the dresses.
- I have to say, I liked her
mother's dress better than hers.
<i>I thought that long dress</i>
<i>made the mother look</i>
<i>like she had a great,</i>
<i>sexy body.</i>
- Really, overall,
I think Tatianna
might have pulled it out
this week.
-<i> Tyra Sanchez.</i>
- I just thought Tyra
was so beautiful,
even though
you didn't ask me yet.
[laughter]
- Well, this is the--
this is the moment now.
<i>Oh, you're giving a--</i>
- Ooh!
-<i> Oh!</i>
I did think the mother's makeup
was a little crazy exaggerated.
- Well, I'm with Cloris.
I vote ten.
<i>They were very chic.</i>
<i>I didn't like the mother's wig,</i>
<i>of course not,</i>
but obviously, it was
a little bit of humor there.
- So is that a ten or what?
- I vote for a ten, yeah.
- Ten, that's three tens.
[laughter]
- Okay, silence.
<i>I have made my decision.</i>
Bring back the girls.
<i>Welcome back.</i>
At this point, it's not about
who's the worst.
<i>It's about who's the best</i>
<i>of the best,</i>
the next drag superstar.
Tyra Sanchez, the other Tyra,
you proved that two Tyras
are better than one.
<i>You're safe.</i>
- Thank you.
- Tatianna, this week,
you came from behind
and rolled over the competition.
<i>You're safe.</i>
- Thank you.
Thank you.
- Pandora Boxx,
you're a funny girl,
but tonight you were
outperformed.
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
-<i> I thought that I was campy</i>
<i>and fun.</i>
<i>I really gave it my all.</i>
<i>I really, really worked hard.</i>
It's like a kick in the balls.
- Raven, for giving
the most dramatic makeover
<i>and literally carrying</i>
<i>Golda Lamé,</i>
proving that she ain't heavy;
she's your mama--
<i>Raven, congratulations,</i>
you're the winner
of this week's challenge.
- Thank you.
[applause]
-<i> You and your drag mother</i>
have won a four-day,
three-night stay and massage
<i>at the luxurious East Canyon</i>
<i>Hotel and Spa in Palm Springs.</i>
- I felt so amazing,
<i>and I knew that Tatianna</i>
<i>was back there</i>
<i>just grinding her toenails</i>
in the tip of her fucking heel.
Thank you, Tatianna,
for picking out my mother.
- Jujubee, you are
a special queen.
<i>But tonight, you and your</i>
<i>mother were out of sync.</i>
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
-<i> I'm in the bottom,</i>
and I can't blame anybody
but myself.
-<i> Two queens stand before me.</i>
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me
<i>and save yourself</i>
<i>from elimination.</i>
The time has come for you
to lip-sync for your life.
Good luck,
and don't fuck it up.
-<i> It's really</i>
<i>kind of heart-wrenching</i>
<i>to lip-sync with Juju</i>
<i>because I love Juju,</i>
<i>but I really want to prove</i>
that I've got what it takes.
-<i> It's hard to try</i>
<i>to beat your friend.</i>
It's a weird position to be in.
-<i> I look at Pandora.</i>
No, I don't see a star
in her at all.
[applause]
- Bravo! Bravo!
- Okay, I've made my decision.
Jujubee...
shantay you stay.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
-<i> Pandora, you shared</i>
<i>your talents</i>
and opened your box
for the world to see.
<i>There's no stopping you.</i>
Now sashay away.
[applause]
[laughter]
-<i> It's hard to constantly get</i>
<i>harsh criticism,</i>
<i>especially when you feel like</i>
they're being harsher on you
than everybody else.
<i>I did really want to win.</i>
<i>But what I brought here wasn't</i>
<i>what they were looking for.</i>
Fuck 'em.
- Four queens remain.
Congratulations, ladies.
And remember,
if you can't love yourself,
how in the hell are you gonna
love somebody else?
Can I get a amen in here?
all: Amen.
- All right, let the music play.


- Gorgeous.
Innocent.
Sexy.
There's some new glamour girls
in town.
And they're sittin'
on a big ol' secret.
I'm back!
[cheering]
That's right, we're back
for an all-new season
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race,</i>
the search for America's
next drag superstar.
[cheers and applause]
We have 12 hot new queens
willing to do whatever it takes.
- Cock-a-doodle-doo!
- Even if that means
they've got to drop, drop...
drop it like it's hot.
[all groan]
And in the end, it all comes
down to this.
The time has come...
for you to lip-synch...
for your life.
Are you ready for the ride
of your life?
- That, to me,
was a complete turn-off.
- More stars.
- Yes, ma'am.
- More fierce.
- Shut the fuck up,
or I'll make you shut up.
- More drama...
- Can we get someone
over here, please?
She can't breathe.
- Than ever before!
- Gentlemen, start your engines.
<i>[car engine starting,</i>
<i>tires screech]</i>
- A new season
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> is</i>
about to burn rubber in three...
two...
one.
- Holy shit.
Oh, wow.
I'm first.
I'm Nicole Paige Brooks
from Atlanta, Georgia.
I get to pick my spot,
I guess.
Oh, wow.
I am what I call
a southern belle,
or a very Atlanta girl.
I want to be on the end.
I'm a Cancer, so I'm a big--
just a big mama.
No...
I think I want to be
on this side.
No, that's the changing area.
I want to be on this end.
- Hello, somebody.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- I'm Nicole.
- Hi, Nicole.
I'm Shangela.
- It's nice to meet you.
Tell me your name again.
- Shangela, like Angela,
but with an s-h, like "sh."
Shangela Laquifa Wadley,
the debutantess
of the deep south.
All right for the country
bitches in the house.
Shangela is
a little bougie, okay?
But she's also your home girl.
How long have
you been doing drag?
- For 15 years.
- No, ma'am.
- Uh-huh.
- All right,
you've got to be perfected.
- And you?
- Only five months.
- Oh, wow.
- Fairly new.
- I hope that I don't fall into
that role of babysitting
and start, like,
fixing people's shit
when I should be really,
like, cutting their bra straps.
- What's up, bitches?
My name is David.
In drag, when I've got on tits
and tights, I go by Raven.
Bitch, this is fucking fierce.
- Oh, take a look around, girl.
Get you some.
- You didn't bring a purse
or nothin'?
- I don't carry a purse.
I stick it all in my tits.
- [laughs]
- I like to be that mysterious,
dark ice queen.
And, like, I think I have a look
that people might be
a little intimidated by.
Am I a ten?
A perfect ten.
- What a sin! Ahh!
- Oh, ohh!
- My name's Jujubee.
I'm 25,
from Boston, Massachusetts.
- I'm Nicole.
- I'm Juju.
- Juju? I love that name.
- Bitch, no, you are
Kimora Lee Simmons.
- Jujubee's just
this fabulous Asian girl.
She's very, like, poppy
and, like, fashion forward.
She loves accessories
and she likes glitter...
'cause it's wicked spah-kly.
- I'm Sahara Davenport.
I'm 25 years old.
And I live in New York City.
Hey, hey, hey.
- Oh, hey.
- Aah!
- Aaah!
[both screaming]
- Sahara Davenport came in.
Sahara and I went
to college together
and have been friends forever,
and I had no idea
she was gonna be on this show.
[both screaming]
- Excuse me, pardon me.
What were you saying?
- [squealing]
- Morgan, Morgan, Morgan!
- Bitch!
- My name is Morgan McMichaels,
and I am 28 years old.
- When I saw Morgan walk in,
I wanted to die.
- Hi.
- Ohh!
See, I know somebody.
Morgan's like my sister.
Like, we started doing drag
at the same time, same club.
- Hi, I'm Nicole.
- People think that
since I'm pretty and I'm sexy
that I should just do slutty
all the time.
I'm just eating
solid food again.
- Hello.
- I'm Mystique.
- Hi!
- I'm Mystique Summers.
I am 25 years old.
Big girls are gonna represent
this year.
Cheeseburger, Taco Bell, and
diet coke on the side, girl.
- Ohh!
- Wow, some of these girls,
they're pretty cute,
but fuck them skinny bitches.
It's a big girl's world.
- Oh, my god.
My direct persona name
is Jessica Wild.
I'm from San Juan,
Puerto Rico.
You like Puerto Ricans?
- I'm 1/4 Puerto.
- I've taken a Puerto Rican.
- My biggest fears in the
competition is with my English.
But if I don't understand
something, I am going to smile.
Uh-oh!
- My drag name is Sonique.
I now live in Atlanta, Georgia.
- Holy shit!
- Oh, my god.
- Oh, my God!
- This is Sonique.
Now I know somebody.
- My mom sent me
to a military school in hopes
that she would get
a little soldier.
Needless to say,
she got a drag queen.
[laughs]
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.
[all greeting her]
- Some pretty bitches in here.
- My name is Tatianna.
I am 21 years old.
both: Mwah. Mwah.
- It's a pleasure to meet you,
Miss Tatianna.
- First time I walked out
of the house in drag,
I was 14 years old.
I don't know how I had the balls
to do it,
but I went to school in drag.
It was my closest taste
of being, like, famous.
Thank you.
- Hey, fake ladies!
[all greeting her]
- I'm Pandora Boxx, and I'm
30-blah-blah years old.
Hey, girls.
- Hi, I'm Jujubee.
- I'm Pandora.
Pandora is definitely a melting
pot of different people.
You know, there's like a dash
of Madonna,
a sprinkle of Goldie Hawn,
and a big chunk of Kathy Griffin
thrown in there.
And she has to kind of like fuse
it all together
into this melted pot of goo
that becomes Pandora.
- Do you sew?
- I do sew.
- Aah! Yes, ma'am!
- I made this.
- You better work.
Look at this.
- Me and miss Pandora, we're
gonna be real good friends.
- Oh!
- Here's another one.
- Oh, excuse me.
- I am Tyra Sanchez, and I'm 21.
- Oh, excuse me.
- Beautiful.
- How gorgeous.
- Da-yamn.
- It's sickening.
- What a body.
- I do think
that I'm the prettiest one.
- Tyra, all right.
Are you bankable, girl?
- [chuckles] Yes.
- I came in,
I had my Rihanna hair on.
My body was right, breasts were
right, makeup was right.
Everything was on point.
I was very much a lady.
- I'm super-excited to get
to know the girls.
Different personalities,
different genres of drag,
different styles of drag.
I really couldn't make
a judgment
on who was the strongest
and who was the weakest.
<i>- Ooh, girl!</i>
<i>You got she mail.</i>
<i>Welcome, racers,</i>
<i>to another glorious season</i>
<i>of</i><span style="bodyStyle"> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
<i>You're here today</i>
<i>because, well,</i>
<i>none of you were smart enough</i>
<i>to leak a sex tape</i>
<i>and land your own</i>
<i>reality TV show.</i>
<i>[laughing] No, no, no.</i>
<i>You've come here to compete</i>
<i>for the title</i>
<i>of America's</i>
<i>next drag superstar.</i>
<i>But to win it,</i>
<i>you've got to earn it, Tina.</i>
<i>Fasten your seatbelts.</i>
<i>This year's ride is gonna be</i>
<i>longer and harder,</i>
<i>with more twists and turns</i>
<i>than Kim Kardashian trying to</i>
<i>wiggle out of a pair of Spanx.</i>
<i>So let's put the stiletto</i>
<i>to the metal.</i>
RuPaul's Drag Race<i> is</i>
<i>about to blow you away.</i>
[cheers and applause]
Hello, hello, hello.
[cheers and applause]
Welcome to<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
- When I see RuPaul enter
the room for the first time,
I'm in a state of shock.
- I am gagging
at the lovely extravaganza.
Wonderful. Hello.
- Tatianna.
- Tatianna.
- Holy shit.
I'm shaking the hand
of a legend.
- Nicole Paige Brooks.
- From Atlanta, Georgia.
- That's right, the ATL.
You're Pandora.
- Pandora Boxx.
- Pleasure to meet you.
Great, great.
- It's really, really cool to
have somebody that you idolize
come over and just--and say
your name immediately.
- You're all so gorgeous.
- I was a little star struck,
I guess.
- I'm so happy you are all here.
Anybody who steps out
of the house
with a pair of high heels
and a wig is my hero.
We searched from coast to coast,
and you are the chosen 12.
[cheers and applause]
All of you are here because you
have charisma, uniqueness,
nerve, and talent.
But do you have that little
something extra it takes to win?
The stakes are high, ladies,
but the rewards are fabulous.
In addition to walking away
with the title
of America's next drag
superstar,
the winner of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i>
will receive
a lifetime supply
of NYX cosmetics
and become the face
of nyxcosmetics.com;
an exclusive, one-year PR
contract
with the leading LGBT firm
Project Publicity;
be featured in L.A. Eyeworks'
legendary designer eyewear
campaign;
and headline
LOGO's<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> tour,</i>
featuring exceptional
Absolut drinks.
And a cash prize of $25,000.
[cheers and applause]
All right, ladies, enough talk.
Are you ready
for your close-ups?
[all cheer]
- Good.
Now, please put your hands
and legs together
for top celebrity photographer
and my good friend Mike Ruiz.
[cheers and applause]
- Okay, ladies, your first
official<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> photo shoot</i>
is inspired by one of my
favorite movies of all time:
<i>Gone With The Wind.</i>
- [gasps]
- Yes.
Now, you'll each pose for Mike,
and then we'll choose
the one queen
who gives the best face, face,
face, I give face, beauty, face.
- Oh, my gosh, it's here.
Competition's on, bitches.
[camera shutter snapping]
- Today, we're doing
a photo shoot
which is inspired
by<i> Gone With The Wind.</i>
- What does she need to know?
- It's the height
of the Civil War.
You need to straddle the cannon,
work the piece of fabric, and,
you know, kind of
interact with the guys.
They're being thrust into
an environment, which, you know,
they're unfamiliar with and they
didn't have any preparation for.
- Yeah, straddle that cannon,
hon.
- Hold on...hold on right here.
- [laughing]
- And here we go.
- All right!
- Oh, lord! Oh, my God.
- Aah!
- Work! Work the fabric!
- Storm comes up, and they're
snapping pictures.
And I don't know what to do.
- Watch your hair!
Your hair is covering your face.
- Work the camera, Jujubee!
Work!
- I feel a little tug
in the back of my leg,
and I think it's gonna fly off,
so I'm grasping onto it.
And then my lashes are just
flapping back and forth.
That's all I can focus on.
I didn't know where the camera
was at this point.
- We got it!
- All right!
How do you feel, Jujubee?
- I have never been blown
like that in my life.
[laughter]
- Yes, you got a
lot of firepower
between your legs, girl.
Don't nobody make a sudden move.
She might blow it.
- When I saw the fan,
I was excited.
'Cause fans make
everything prettier.
- Okay, and...there we go!
- Ooh! Lord Jesus!
When they started cranking up
the fan, I was just like,
ugh, really?
- Watch your hair in your face.
All right, we got it!
Sonique, ride that cannon.
- Yeah, that hits the spot.
Pandora's box is on fire!
- All right!
- Jessica's a girl gone wild!
Yeah! Serve it!
Suzanne Sugarbaker!
That's what I'm talkin' about!
Hoo hoo hoo!
Triumphant!
As god is my witness.
Uh-oh!
Those damn Yankees took
everything from you!
- Morgan McMichaels had
a problem
with having her wig fly off,
and she tried to recover
from it,
but I find
that she never really did.
- 3, 2, 1!
Okay, we got it.
That's it.
We did get a good shot,
but it was a struggle.
Thank you, Morgan.
- Thanks, Morgan.
Wow, the competition has
just begun
and they're already flipping
their wigs.
- Honey, how was it?
- I mean, this wig
went on vacation, girl.
She flew right off.
- [laughing]
- As I see everybody changing,
the thing that stood out most
to me is, kind of forget,
like, how much it really takes
to transform somebody
and how amazingly different
they can look
from--from one to the other.
- I wonder what everyone's
gonna look like out of drag.
I hope some of you are
attractive boys, like me.
- [laughing]
- Nicole Paige Brooks.
- From Atlanta, Georgia.
- That's right.
- And I will never go hungry
again.
- All right.
- Am I gonna pinch your nipples?
Ohh! They bounce too.
This one's jealous.
- Oh, I think it's leaking.
- Nicole had all
of the southern charm,
but I felt like
in the photoshoot situation,
you know,
she wasn't delivering couture,
she was delivering, you know,
little catalog.
Look off into the distance,
off into the horizon.
Too far off, too far off,
sister.
Sahara Davenport had a really
great understanding of her body
and how to move.
Although she didn't have
that same understanding
with her face.
- We're gonna sit you
on that cannon
with these
two gorgeous soldiers.
- And I'm like, "Oh, my god,
you want me to stand
next to them?"
- Don't teeter over it.
- I can't cross my legs,
anything.
The skirt is so tight.
I'm like trying my hardest
to be perfect.
- Chin down a little bit.
Remember the camera's down here.
- Chin down!
- I felt that I could
have did better.
I should have been just, like
more focused
on the picture itself.
- We got it!
- Got it! Wonderful.
- Be aware of the camera.
Pretty, pretty face.
- Pretty face.
Think Franklin mint plate.
- Ha ha, yeah.
- I wanted to bring
the most fiercest possible.
- Chicken cutlets!
Chicken cutlets.
- But my boobs were falling out
the top of the dress.
RuPaul's screaming,
Mike is screaming,
and through my head is going,
"bitch, pull it together.
Look at that camera
and pull it together."
both: Yes!
- Cover up, dear.
[laughing]
Ooh, is that a possum
in the woods?
[laughter]
Yes, yes!
War is hell!
But you look gorgeous!
- [laughing] Right.
All right, we got it!
- Gorgeous!
- That is
what I'm talkin' about.
- Yes.
- [sighs]
I love a good blow job.
- [giggles] Brat.
- That was amazing.
Ohh.
I was able to spread my cooch
and air it out.
- Immediately, Raven and Morgan
were kind of off-putting.
- [gasps]
Oh, my god.
- We're all staring
at each other,
'cause we're just in shock.
You is naked.
- I think Morgan is gonna get
on my nerves.
- Son of a bitch.
- Oh, wait, wait,
these are my wigs.
- Do you usually do your own
hair and makeup, or...
- Um...technically, well, no.
The answer is no.
I felt that people
were looking down on me
for only doing this
for five months.
It just made me feel more
determined to show them
that I can do it.
Bah, bah, bah! Whoop!
Uhh!
- Hey, dolls.
Come on down.
Gather around.
Mike and I went over
all your photos.
You each did a great job.
But only one of you
can be the best.
The winner of the first
<i>Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> photoshoot is...</i>
Raven.
- Oh, my god.
[applause]
Congratulations.
- I think me winning the
first challenge is gonna make
the other bitches
kind of open their eyes,
'cause I plan on winning
the grand prize.
- Have fun tonight,
'cause when it comes
to<i> RuPaul's Drag Race,</i>
tomorrow is another day.
[alarm beeping]
- Gather round, dolls.
Now, if you haven't guessed
by now,
<i>Gone With The Wind</i><span style="bodyStyle"> is</i>
the inspiration
for your first main challenge.
Now, Scarlett O'Hara was one
fierce bitch.
She survived the Civil War,
the fires of Atlanta,
and the ransacking of Tara.
And still, she was able to turn
out a drop-dead gorgeous outfit,
just using the curtains
in her window.
And now it's your turn to do
the same.
Inspired by
Miss Scarlett O'Hara,
you must create
your best drag look
using just these curtains,
courtesy of smith+noble.
And in the work room, we've got
some used home furnishings
we picked up at
Out of the Closet
that you can use to accessorize.
You'll wear your own wigs,
shoes, and undergarments.
And when it comes to makeup,
NYX Cosmetics has you covered.
Tomorrow, you'll be debuting
your stunning
"gone with the window"
drag looks on the main stage.
Raven, since you won
the photoshoot,
you get to choose
your curtains first.
Choose wisely.
Take your time.
That's what winning
the challenge gets you.
Take note, girls.
- I'm gonna go with these.
- You're going with those?
- Yes.
- No, don't pick that one.
- In a moment, I'm gonna let
the rest of you fight it out.
And remember, only one
matching set of curtains each.
Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best woman win.
[giggling]
- There weren't no ladies on
that set today.
There were men
running for curtains.
You pushed me! You pushed me!
- This is mine.
- It is on now.
- I dashed for the first set
of curtains I saw.
And along came Tatianna,
and she grabbed the same one.
- Reach all you want to.
Reach all you want to.
- Y'all could go get
another one.
- This is mine.
I was like, back up off.
I wasn't letting go.
And so she didn't hold on
any longer after that.
I win.
- I got to the curtain first.
And I pulled it down first.
It really wasn't that classy
of her to do that.
- Ooh, I broke a nail.
- Keep it moving, bitches.
- No, sir!
<i>- The rules of the challenge</i>
<i>are pick a set of curtains</i>
<i>and make your costume from it.</i>
<i>We also have to incorporate</i>
<i>homewear,</i>
<i>pieces from Out of the Closet.</i>
- I'm going to be flawless
with this.
- Pandora, get that table back
there; you can have that one.
- I was trying to figure out
where I was going
and where we were putting
our stuff.
And then Shangela said,
"come over here,
come over to this station,
and we'll work together."
And I was like,
"You want to work together
because you don't know how
to sew, and I know how to sew."
- Could I beg you just to, like,
show me how to sew
that little piece together?
Quickly.
- I guess.
- Hey, I'm not gonna ask him
to do it for me.
I want to learn.
But I need to be right there
next to the teacher.
<i>[squeals]</i>
<i>Look at this.</i>
<i>Look what happened.</i>
<i>Is that supposed to happen?</i>
- Oh, what are you doing?
- I did it.
I just pushed the foot pedal.
- If I don't get to finish my
outfit 'cause I run out of time,
then I'll be like,
"Damn you bitches!"
<i>- Sahara, I'm sewing.</i>
<i>Thank you!</i>
<i>- You better work, diva.</i>
Work!
- Oh, my god, Pandora.
- Mystique felt like the fabric
wasn't plus-size girl-friendly.
What size are you?
- 22.
- Really?
- Mystique looks like she's
making a huge pillowcase.
For Mystique to sit there
and think that her curtains
are not plus-size-friendly
is a crock of shit.
<i>- Bitch...I'm doing</i>
<i>something wrong.</i>
- You're doing something wrong?
- Mine is broke.
I broke...
- You what?
You broke the needle?
- No, I just broke
the whole machine.
Yeah, this is an issue.
- So now we're fucked.
- I should get ready,
'cause I'll have to lip-sync
for my life in a minute.
- Hey, is anybody home?
all: Hello.
- Clean up this mess!
No, just kidding.
Keep working.
Hi, Mystique.
- Hey, girl.
- All right.
How's it going for you?
- Kind of rough.
- Rough? Really?
- Oh, you don't have a, uh...
- No.
- Dress for it.
- This is the biggest one.
- Why don't you pad it?
- I don't got time for that.
- Well, this challenge is about
overcoming adversity and--
- Oh, yeah.
- You'll do it.
- Like I said, fucking bitches
fucking up the house.
- I'm gonna come over here
to Shangela.
- Hey, Ru.
- What's your inspiration?
- Well, this is gonna be a hot
gun concoction.
- I see.
- Along with--I'm gonna also do
some sewing, and Pandora 's
kind of helped show me
the machine.
- I see.
- I might be the new bitch
on the block,
but in order to be on the show,
I quit my job, because I love
performing as Shangela.
So I have 100% committed myself
to this.
- Oh, my goodness, corn?
- Yeah.
- Are you gonna be using corn?
- It is "the south will rise"
meets<i> Children of the Corn.</i>
- I've seen great potential
in you,
so you've got to--you've got
to bring it, honey.
Tyra.
- Hi.
- Hi, honey.
- How are you?
- I'm good.
Now, you have a child.
- I do have a son.
His name is Jeremiah.
- Jeremiah --oh, that's
the tattoo you have there.
- Yeah, tattoo on my arm.
- Why, Jeremiah?
- Um, we wanted a name from
the bible.
My name comes from the bible,
so--
- Tyra 's in the bible?
- No, not Tyra.
James is in the bible.
- [laughing]
He was born the first week
of my 12th grade year.
It's like the first time I'll be
away from him this long.
My son is, like, my major
motivation
for winning this competition.
- You know, a family that drags
together,
stays together.
All right.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
- Sahara, hi, honey.
- Hi, Ru.
- You put a lot of work into
this bustier.
- I have.
- And is this the vision you had
from the very start?
- I don't know where I'm going
with it, to be honest.
- Are you a little worried
about that?
- Of course I'm worried!
I still want to be gorgeous,
but I also want to have a good--
a good garment to show.
- Yeah.
I think you got a little bit
more work to do,
so I don't want to keep you.
- All right, thank you.
- Hello, Tatianna.
- Hello.
- This is what you wanted.
- Yes.
- But you haven't gotten
very far here.
- No.
- What's going on?
- Looking at it from
a distance,
I chose it 'cause it looked like
it more of a silver hue
that I could maybe do
silver shoes with.
- Right.
So you're looking for an accent
to match your shoes.
- Mm-hmm.
Because to me if you have a--
- You have big feet?
- 13.
- Yeah, well, that never
stopped me.
- But I also don't like to show
my toes.
- You don't like to show
your toes.
- My big toe is shaped
like a doorknob,
and so I don't think
it looks good
in open-toed shoes.
- Well, I mean, just...
crazy--I have got to see
your toe.
Can I please see your toe?
Because you can't go through
life...
- Hiding my big toe?
See?
It's just too big.
- That is a gorgeous toe.
I know people who would pay
to suck that toe.
- [laughs]
- I say let it go.
Let it go.
And that advice is gonna help
you in this competition.
You have to go for it,
and don't let anything
stop you.
- Okay.
- Free your toes...
And the rest will follow.
- [laughs]
- Hey, Jessica.
Can I see what you're doing?
- Yes, I get this because
I love the color,
but it is very clear,
and I have problems
with that,
because I don't want to look
like I am naked.
- You don't want to look
like a whore, do you?
- No!
Not on camera.
- [laughs]
Maybe after the show.
- Yeah.
- What's underneath here?
- I use a corset.
- Oh, is it a corset
you brought from home?
- Yes, and I make this.
- I make in...
Sorry,
explain it in Spanish.
- Just a little top,
and you could say it in Spanish
if you like.
- Yeah?
- Yes.
- Okay...
[speaking Spanish]
-<i> Si.</i>
- [speaking Spanish]
-<i> Muy bien, muy bien.</i>
Ooh.
- Because it's going to give
a special touch.
- Oh, wow.
Now, do you pad anything?
- I don't have a lady body.
- Can we see?
- I have a guy butt.
- [laughing]
- And I need to make the curves
of a lady.
- I can't wait to see it
on the main stage.
- Thanks, Ru.
- All right, I'm gonna move
over here
to see miss Morgan
and see what you're up to.
- Hi.
- What are your plans for?
- Okay, now, I'm not sure what
I'm gonna do with the sleeves.
But I think I'm gonna do
the high neck
and maybe try and incorporate
this into it.
- Ah, wow.
- I got this.
- Uh-huh.
- You know, which is huge.
I could use this as a skirt,
really.
- And you feel like you have
enough time?
- Um, I will make time.
I will get it done.
- I see.
All right, ladies.
<i>Gather round.</i>
I'll see you tomorrow on
the main stage,
where our extra-special guest
judge will be...
Kathy Griffin.
- [gasping]
- I really identify with
Kathy Griffin.
I love her, so I'm excited that
she's gonna be here.
- Now, remember, in this world,
you only get one chance to make
a first impression.
So don't fuck It up.
<i>Good luck.</i>
<i>See you soon.</i>
- I'm kind of scared about what
the judges are gonna say.
With this hot-ass mess I'm gonna
wear out there tomorrow,
this is gonna be brutal.
- Whoo! Burning!
[all chattering]
<i>- Tonight is my first day that</i>
<i>I'm going to walk the runway.</i>
So I have a lot of great
emotions.
- Are you nervous?
- Yeah. Yeah, I am.
The only thing on my mind
is finish this garment.
- What you think, Sahara?
- Ooh, yeah.
- I think Mystique is a mistake.
<i>- I love doing drag because</i>
<i>I love the transformation--</i>
<i>the costuming, the hair,</i>
<i>the makeup.</i>
<i>The glamour of it all.</i>
It is an art form.
<i>- To be able to change yourself</i>
<i>into a completely different</i>
<i>person</i>
<i>is very empowering.</i>
- Yes.
- Yes!
- Hey, you guys.
So happy to see all of you.
Santino,
so good to have you back.
- I've missed you.
- Merle, you look marvelous
tonight.
- My world's been empty
without you, Ru.
- Hey, Mike, what do you think
of our queens so far?
- Oh, I'm very impressed.
- And miss Kathy Griffin,
welcome to the show.
- Ru, I cannot believe that you
dismembered our first lady
and stole Michelle Obama's arms.
They are perfect, as are you.
- Okay, judges, for this week's
challenge,
inspired by miss
Scarlett O'Hara,
the girls had to turn
out a breathtaking drag look
using just curtains
and some used home furnishings.
Are you ready to see what
they've created?
Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best woman win.
<i>- I think that I do have</i>
<i>a good chance</i>
<i>at winning this challenge.</i>
<i>My dress looks amazing.</i>
<i>- I love the fabric</i>
<i>of the underdress.</i>
<i>It's actually the carpet</i>
<i>and the drapes.</i>
- Oh, wow.
<i>- And they don't match,</i>
<i>and they don't need to,</i>
<i>not today.</i>
<i>- That's so 2000.</i>
<i>There is nothing dirty about</i>
<i>this Sanchez.</i>
<i>- Here comes some sass.</i>
<i>- Yes, sassy miss Raven.</i>
<i>- My runway walk is giving them</i>
<i>a little hip action.</i>
<i>Flip of the hair,</i>
<i>working it out,</i>
<i>giving them sex.</i>
<i>- I do like the focus</i>
<i>on the waist.</i>
<i>- Yes, now she--</i>
<i>- Even when there isn't one,</i>
<i>she kind of manufactured one.</i>
<i>- That's right.</i>
<i>- Which is essential</i>
<i>in your business.</i>
- Wow.
<i>- Sonique, boom.</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>
<i>- Southern belle, African,</i>
<i>playboy mansion,</i>
<i>all rolled into one.</i>
<i>I definitely think that no one</i>
<i>else came up with that concept.</i>
- I wonder what she uses
that rod for.
<i>Here is Jujubee.</i>
<i>- I feel great--</i>
<i>sickly, gorgeous.</i>
<i>I wasn't going for pretty.</i>
<i>I was going for fierce.</i>
<i>I put on my feathers</i>
<i>and I felt like a big ol' style</i>
<i>warrior goddess.</i>
<i>- Lauren Bacall would love</i>
<i>that collar.</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>
<i>- She will wrestle you</i>
<i>to the ground for that collar.</i>
<i>- Everyone's doing redhead,</i>
<i>Kathy.</i>
<i>- Look at those gams.</i>
<i>- The legs are killing me.</i>
<i>- I didn't really know what</i>
<i>to do.</i>
<i>The lights are in my eyes.</i>
<i>I see Ru 's teeth glowing</i>
<i>at me.</i>
<i>Freaking out inside.</i>
<i>- She's serving some</i>
<i>Raquel Welch there,</i>
<i>and I don't just mean her hair.</i>
<i>- Sahara.</i>
<i>- Uh-oh, it's raining.</i>
<i>- She is throwing</i>
<i>some serious shade.</i>
<i>- We'll see her poolside</i>
<i>in South Beach.</i>
<i>- I'm excited to work</i>
<i>the runway.</i>
<i>That's one of my favorite</i>
<i>things.</i>
<i>- I like the mix of the blues.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>
<i>- Looks great.</i>
<i>- It's refreshing.</i>
<i>- As I step onto the runway, it</i>
<i>can be a little intimidating.</i>
<i>You don't want to fuck It up in</i>
<i>front of RuPaul.</i>
<i>- There's corn hanging</i>
<i>from her hand!</i>
<i>- What is that corn doing</i>
<i>there?</i>
<i>- I've been corn cobbed.</i>
<i>- It's a co--you been</i>
<i>corn cobbed?</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>
<i>- Jessica Wild.</i>
<i>- Wild flower.</i>
<i>- It's inspiring, a movie that</i>
<i>I never saw.</i>
<i>But in my imagination,</i>
<i>that girl is amazing,</i>
<i>like Jessica, so...</i>
<i>- How did she get it back from</i>
<i>the sweatshop so quickly?</i>
<i>'cause it looks like it took</i>
<i>many, many children</i>
<i>to make those flowers.</i>
<i>- You're absolutely right.</i>
-<i> It's a lot of work.</i>
<i>- Morgan McMichaels.</i>
<i>Look at that body.</i>
<i>- My attitude is a positive</i>
<i>one.</i>
<i>I will not go home.</i>
<i>This challenge</i>
<i>will not send me home.</i>
<i>- I love the little belt</i>
<i>and the little belly jewel.</i>
<i>- I love the little eyelids</i>
<i>there.</i>
<i>- And I never met a grommet</i>
<i>I didn't like.</i>
<i>- Yeah, grommets are fabulous.</i>
<i>- Me too. I don't know</i>
<i>what that is, but I agree.</i>
- [laughing]
<i>All right!</i>
<i>- That's not just an outfit;</i>
<i>it's a lifestyle.</i>
<i>- Who needs a hybrid</i>
<i>when you could have a basket</i>
<i>on your head?</i>
<i>- I pulled out every single</i>
<i>trick that I have in the bag.</i>
<i>- Ohh!</i>
[laughter]
<i>- If I was gonna go home,</i>
<i>I was gonna be memorable</i>
<i>for something.</i>
<i>- Nicole Paige brooks.</i>
<i>- My outfit's like the madame</i>
<i>running the saloon</i>
<i>down the street</i>
<i>from the Tara</i>
<i>that's burning down.</i>
- Yes, miss thing's got a little
bustle in her hustle.
Vivien Westwood
does Vivien Leigh.
- Oh, my God,
I wish I 'd said that!
<i>- Pandora Boxx.</i>
- I can't believe that bitch
went into my purse
and took that wig.
<i>I just can't even believe it.</i>
<i>- It's like a body double.</i>
<i>- There's only one chance</i>
<i>I'm gonna get</i>
<i>to walk a runway in front</i>
<i>of Kathy Griffin,</i>
<i>and I am wearing that wig.</i>
<i>- Hello, dolls.</i>
I have to say,
anyone who has the courage
to break free
and follow their heart
is my hero.
Based on your "gone with
the window" challenge,
your photoshoot,
and tonight's presentation
on the main stage,
I've made some decisions.
When I call your name,
please step forward.
Jujubee.
Tatianna.
<i>Raven.</i>
<i>Sonique.</i>
Jessica Wild.
Nicole Paige Brooks.
Here's the bad news.
None of you are the best.
And here is the good news.
<i>None of you are the worst.</i>
<i>Congratulations...</i>
you're all safe.
- I don't fucking like
being just safe.
I wanted to be one
of the top ones.
- As you move forward in this
competition,
I have one piece of advice
for you.
<i>Step up your game.</i>
You may leave the stage.
For you six, one of you will be
the winner of this challenge.
And for one of you,
it's curtains.
Now, we're gonna begin
with Tyra.
So these are the curtains
you started with.
<i>- I would have liked</i>
<i>to have seen</i>
<i>just a little more originality.</i>
<i>- I don't mind that it's not</i>
<i>necessarily innovative,</i>
but it is a very classic shape.
- I have a very small criticism,
which is just maybe have a
little more fun with your face.
Smile, more facial expressions.
And remember, it's drag.
So give me face.
- Let's take a look at your
photograph with Mike Ruiz.
What was going through
your mind?
- Pose, but don't fall.
- I disagree.
I think falling on those
two guys
would have been the best thing
that could have happened
that day.
<i>- Shangela, tell us what this</i>
<i>outfit says about you.</i>
- Well, you know, a little fun,
a little rough around the edges,
because I'm fairly new
to the drag world.
- Your bust line
is non-existent.
There's no waist definition
there.
<i>- Wow.</i>
- I think you need to have
a better understanding
of how to relate your face
in a photo shoot situation.
<i>- Morgan McMichaels, what does</i>
<i>your outfit say about you?</i>
<i>- I thought warrior.</i>
<i>- I love it.</i>
<i>I love it because I'm calling</i>
<i>you Chergefani.</i>
You're like a little Cher,
a little Fergie,
a little Gwen Stefani.
- And Cher wore something like
that in her<i> Half Breed</i><span style="bodyStyle"> video.</i>
[imitating Cher]
In<i> Half Breed.</i>
[laughter]
- It reads as a lot
of different things,
and that could have gone
horribly wrong.
But it worked.
- So how much?
[laughter]
<i>- Pandora Boxx.</i>
<i>- It's like looking in a</i>
<i>mirror, it really is.</i>
- Kathy, would you say she's
the most beautiful
of all the queens?
- Well, obviously.
[laughter]
<i>- Wow!</i>
<i>Now, see, I wish that some</i>
<i>of the energy in this photo,</i>
<i>you could bring to the main</i>
<i>stage in your presentation.</i>
- Here, you're very demure
and girly.
There, you're like belting it
out like Judy Garland
on barbiturates
<i>and</i><span style="bodyStyle"> amphetamines!</i>
- Mystique Summers Madison.
- I'm torn about the dress.
Remember, it is the first
impression.
- I may be a big girl,
but I can get down with
the skinny bitches
and wear something short
if I want to.
[laughter]
<i>- Now, is that your breast</i>
<i>coming out?</i>
- Got milk?
[laughter]
- All the humor we're seeing
from you now,
I would loved to have seen
in that picture.
<i>- Yes.</i>
- That's right--
know who you are,
and deliver at all times.
<i>All right, Sahara Davenport.</i>
<i>Your first impression for us.</i>
- Well, my boyfriend's Asian,
so I went with the parasol.
- Well, nothing says Civil War
like my Asian boyfriend.
[laughter]
<i>I love the dress, I just don't</i>
<i>think it's draggy enough.</i>
- I agree; it probably could be
a little more flamboyant.
- I'm a New Yorker.
I'm always on the move.
So I decide to do something
a little more contemporary.
- But, with that said, you know,
this is a drag competition.
<i>- Yes.</i>
<i>Well, thank you, ladies.</i>
While the six of you untuck in
the Interior Illusions lounge,
the judges and I will
deliberate.
<i>Thank you.</i>
Okay, now just between us girls,
we've got a little work to do.
<i>Let's talk about Mystique.</i>
That outfit was raggedy as hell.
<i>I mean, the split was even</i>
<i>raggedy,</i>
<i>but it was entertaining.</i>
- If they were at a drag show
and she did that split,
all the gays would go crazy
and cheer.
Bad dress, though.
- Her humor kind of sells,
like, the raggedy dress.
- Shangela.
<i>- Too old-fashioned looking.</i>
<i>- She had a lot more</i>
<i>personality</i>
<i>in the question and answer part</i>
<i>that the walk.</i>
So she definitely could really
learn how to perform, I think.
<i>- We're not judging potential</i>
<i>a year down the line.</i>
We're picking a drag superstar
today.
- Today.
This is<i> RuPaul's Drag Race;</i>
not RuPaul's School for Girls.
<i>Sahara.</i>
- Chic and wonderful and sweet
and great poses,
but I don't know if she really
has the fabulousness.
- Exactly, you know.
It's all about
the razzle dazzle.
You know, and we didn't really
get to really see that.
<i>- Tyra.</i>
- Beautiful, great visual.
Great dress, great hair,
great makeup.
Where's the personality?
- Wessonality--none whatsoever.
<i>Morgan McMichaels.</i>
- I didn't really get
the fun personality.
- I loved the concept.
Overall, just a really
well-executed look.
<i>- Pandora Boxx.</i>
<i>- She was really humorous,</i>
<i>and I thought her look</i>
<i>was great.</i>
<i>- She needs that sort of drag</i>
<i>personality like that.</i>
"I'm taking the stage,
I'm owning it.
I'm here, bitches."
- With that said, silence!
Let's bring the girls...
back in.
<i>Welcome back, ladies.</i>
Tyra Sanchez...
The judges loved your look.
But...do you have
the personality
to be the next drag superstar?
Congratulations.
<i>You're safe.</i>
Shangela...you have an
irrepressible energy,
but can energy make up
for a lack of experience?
I'm sorry, my dear.
You're up for elimination.
- I expected to be
in the bottom group.
<i>Now I'm thinking in my head,</i>
<i>let's turn it out.</i>
- Morgan McMichaels, you made
a lasting first impression
with the judges,
and you are the winner
of this challenge.
[applause]
- Thank you very much.
- You will receive immunity
from next week's elimination.
- Yes.
- Plus, you'll be doing a
photo spread
for Interior Illusions
that will be featured in
<i>Lux</i><span style="bodyStyle"> magazine.</i>
<i>Congratulations.</i>
- Thank you very much.
- Winning any challenge in this
competition is amazing.
But to win the very first one,
I set myself a high bar.
- Pandora Boxx,
congratulations.
You're safe.
- Thank you.
[applause]
- Mystique Summers Madison.
There is one word
for your outfit.
Raggedy.
But...based on your
unforgettable presentation...
I'm giving you a get out of jail
free card.
<i>You're safe.</i>
- Thank you.
<i>- Pull it together, my dear!</i>
[applause]
- Since I was almost cut, now
I'm gonna work even harder,
because I believe I still could
be the next drag superstar.
- Sahara Davenport.
<i>This pains me.</i>
<i>You're a beautiful doll.</i>
But your personality did not
shine through tonight.
<i>I'm sorry, my dear.</i>
<i>You are up for elimination.</i>
- My heart fills with tears.
It's so crazy,
because I'm here to win,
but, like, I don't want to go
against my friend.
- I expected to be in the bottom
two for this week,
but I did not expect to be going
against Sahara.
<i>Sahara and I went to college</i>
<i>together</i>
<i>and have been friends forever.</i>
<i>- Two queens stand before me.</i>
This is your last chance
to impress me
and save yourselves
from elimination.
The time has come...
for you to lip-synch...
for your life.
And remember, good luck,
and don't fuck it up.
[techno music]
<i>- As I'm performing,</i>
<i>I'm looking at the judges,</i>
<i>and some are making great eye</i>
<i>contact with me,</i>
<i>and others are looking</i>
<i>only at Sahara.</i>
So I'm thinking, turn it up,
Shangela, turn it up.
And that's what I did.
- Whoo!
<i>- I looked over and she had</i>
<i>ripped her skirt off</i>
<i>and was going crazy.</i>
I'm gonna have to shut it down.
- When she hit the floor,
I'm like, yes, yes, bitch.
Work it.
- It looked like<i> Mortal Kombat.</i>
[laughter]
[laughter and applause]
- Wow.
Ladies,
I've made my decision.
Sahara Davenport...
Chantay, you stay.
- Yes!
- Congratulations, girl.
- [whispering] I'm sorry.
- [whispering]
Please, you don't have to...
I love you.
- It's a bittersweet moment.
I'm happy that I survived.
But, of course, I'm sad.
You know, I sent my friend home.
- Shangela...
you have only just begun.
But I have a feeling
we haven't seen
the last of you yet.
Good luck, my dear.
Now sashay away.
- Thank you all.
[applause]
[laughter]
- It was disappointing.
If I was to lose to anyone
in this group,
I'm glad it was
my sister Sahara.
That was a great experience,
and now it's time for me to pack
these wigs and go home.
- This was truly
a bittersweet victory.
Congratulations, ladies, for
surviving your first challenge.
And remember,
if you can't love yourself,
how in the hell you gonna love
somebody else?
Can I get an amen up in here?
all: Amen.
- Now let the music play.


-<i> Previously</i>
<i>on</i><span style="bodyStyle"> RuPaul's Drag Race...</i>
- Big girls are gonna represent
this year.
Fuck them skinny bitches.
- Pandora, you stuck me
with these fucking bitches.
Oh, my God.
I'm in a group with, like,
Satan's baby.
I could be a bigger bitch.
- I need money!
My biggest fears in
the competition is my English.
Please help me.
- Raven, during the solo,
you didn't make a lot of money.
- Fuck.
I fucked this up.
- You're up for elimination.
Nicole Paige Brooks,
sashay away.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
-<i> And tonight...</i>
Well, howdy, y'all.
<i>The dolls will be gagging on</i>
<i>the eleganza.</i>
- Aah!
-<i> And it don't taste like</i>
<i>chicken.</i>
- Did you just put shortening
in your crotch?
- Cock a doodle doo!
-<i> With extra special</i>
<i>guest judges</i>
<i>Kathy Najimy</i>
<i>and Tanya Tucker.</i>
- Whoo!
-<i> The winner</i>
<i>of</i><span style="bodyStyle"> RuPaul's Drag Race</i>

[alarm beeps]
- Oh, God.
- Oh, wow.
- Not a picnic.
- Oh...
- We're eating something.
- Do we have to eat?
- Oh, Lord.
- As we walked into
the work space,
all I saw was one long table
with ten chairs.
Something is going in my mouth.
I know that much.
- Just hope it ain't
no cherry pie.
- Nicole says, "Be safe, bitch."
- There's more room over here
now.
Coming back into the work room
after Nicole had left
and I had to lip synch
for my life, it felt good
that I had beat her.
Being in the bottom two, bitch?
No.
- I bet that's nerve-racking.
- I did not come here
to lip synch for my life.
I came here to win.
- We love you, Nicole.
- But you got to go.
[siren wails]
-<i> Ooh, girl.</i>
<i>You've got she-mail.</i>
<i>Cock a doodle doo.</i>
<i>Howdy, racers.</i>
<i>Are you</i>
<i>a coal miner's daughter</i>
<i>or just a boy named Sue?</i>
<i>Well, either way,</i>
<i>for this next challenge,</i>
<i>you best pray that Jesus</i>
<i>takes the wheel.</i>
<i>And remember,</i>
<i>no matter what happens,</i>
<i>I will always love you.</i>
<i>[laughs]</i>
Well, howdy, y'all.
[cheers and applause]
Well, my, my, my.
Go on, now.
Sit a spell, y'all.
Now, Georgia is where my career
really took off.
I am a country queen at heart.
In those early years,
I had no money.
I would eat anything.
And now that's what
you're gonna do.
[groaning]
- Mystique's gonna finally win
a challenge.
Finally.
- Your mini-challenge
is a taste test
to figure out if what
you're eating is chicken...
or what.
What?!
Or chicken.
Chicken or what?!
The first two queens
to get three points
will be the winners.
Oh, and please put on your
blindfolds.
- Oh.
- No, sir.
- I did not know that this was
gonna be drag<i> Survivor.</i>
- Here is y'all's first course.
Ready?
Let's eat.
- Mm.
Answers please.
The correct answer is "what?!"
They were bull testicles.
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- Nothing says country cuisine
like bull testicles.
Okay, ladies.
Second course.
Dig in.
It's finger-licking good.
All right.
Answers please.
The correct answer is "what?!"
Mystique has two right.
Morgan has two.
And Pandora has two.
What you just put in your mouth
was soy chicken.
- Oh, okay.
- Isn't so bad.
Third course.
Dig in.
[ominous music]
- Ew.
- I'm thinking that it's, like,
a rat tail or something.
I knew that wasn't chicken,
honey.
- Chicken or what?!
The correct answer is "what?!"
Now, what you just put
in your mouth...
were frog legs.
- Oh!
- Ladies, we have a three-way
tie between Mystique...
- Hell yeah.
- Pandora, and Morgan.
In front of you is a basket of
chicken, rabbit, alligator,
and deep-fried cow brains.
Mm-mm.
The first two queens to finish
everything in their baskets
and show me their empty mouths
will be the winners.
Are you ready?
Dig in.
Melts in your mouth.
Not in your hands.
- I had a plan.
Chew halfway, fill your mouth
with water, swallow.
- Fuck these skinny bitches.
Yummy.
You have to eat everything.
- Hell yeah.
- All right.
Empty mou--all right, she ate
everything.
Mystique is--we have a winner
over here.
- Mystique might as well have
picked up the basket,
opened the hatch,
and just dropped it down.
She was done like that.
- It's down to Pandora
and Morgan McMichaels.
Morgan has two morsels left.
- Swallow, Morgan.
Swallow.
- I took one swallow of
cow brains, and I just ralphed.
- Aah!
- You're still in the game.
You're still in the game.
- Come on, Pandora.
You got it, girl.
You got it.
- We got a second winner
over here.
Morgan McMichaels.
- [belches]
- Congratulations,
Mystique and Morgan.
You're winners, baby,
and the captains for your next
group challenge.
- Congratulations.
- For today's main challenge,
you'll be shooting a commercial
for Disco Extra-Greasy
Shortening.
That's Disco--Extra-Greasy.
And you're gonna be selling it
country-queen style.
Okay, Mystique.
Who do you choose?
- Pandora.
- Pandora, come on down.
- Raven.
- West coast.
- West coast.
- Juju.
- Laotian in the house.
- Sahara.
- I was picking strategically.
Other people was probably not.
They was picking friends.
Tatianna.
- Tatianna.
- Sonique.
- So Jessica and Tyra remain.
- Mystique kind of looked at me
like, "Who?"
And I was like,
"Fuck no to Tyra."
- The spicy Latina.
- Jessica.
- It didn't bother me at all.
They saved the best for last.
- Here are two scripts for your
commercials.
One for fried chicken
and one for fried fish fillets.
Mystique, you get to pick one.
- I'll get the closest one...
- All right.
Both commercials have the same
country queen characters.
Your commercials will debut
tomorrow on the main stage.
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.
- We have fried fish fillets.
- Fish?
- I like some fish.
- There's a little concern in
my mind about Mystique leading.
- We're gonna have you as
Disco Critter.
You have this line
and you have that line,
then that's it.
- I picked Jessica because
I didn't want her
to have a part where she has
to actually listen
to everybody mingle in with
everybody.
You don't know that much
English.
- All right.
- Ellie Mae?
- I'm a chameleon, darling.
I can do whatever I need to.
- Aunt Judy Faye,
and Baby Girl.
- Baby Girl.
- Who wants to do
Aunt Judy Faye?
I asked the girls who they felt
they wanted to do.
Then I made the executive
decision.
Do you want to do Ellie Mae?
- Yeah.
- Do you want to do the baby?
- Doesn't matter.
- I think she has more
of a baby face.
- I do too.
- I'll be the baby.
I'll be the baby.
- Everyone wanted to be
something, you know, fun,
something, you know, pretty.
- Disco Critter, do you want
to do that part?
- You're gonna be, like,
a chicken.
- A chicken.
- So I get the Disco Critter,
which is a fucking chicken.
And it really pissed me off.
- Okay, so Raven
has Disco Critter.
Raven is the best makeup artist
in this competition by far.
I knew that Raven would be able
to execute the character
with her personality
and her makeup skills.
- Yeah, I'm gonna be
a fucking chicken.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Welcome to another
home-fried meal.
Welcome to another home...
- Do you need help
learning that?
- What?
- Do you need help
learning that?
- No, no.
- Okay, okay.
- The girls said,
"We give the chicken
because don't talk a lot."
At the end, I realize
the chicken talk a lot.
Welcome to another
home-fry meal.
- Mystique decides to give
Jessica
the opening and closing
monologues, I'll say.
They weren't just lines.
- Shortening?
- Shortening.
- Shortening?
Shortening.
- Shortenin'.
- Shortenin'.
- I'm kind of scared.
- [groaning]
-<i> Uh, I hope this don't</i>
<i>fall apart.</i>
- The main challenge today
is to put on a commercial
for Disco Extra-Greasy
Shortening.
- Oh, Auntie, I just had the
worst day of my life.
- Ellie Mae,
why ya in such a state?
- We only had about three hours
to learn the lines.
- It's that mean
Billie Joe McAllister.
He's been picking on me all day.
My biggest worry for the team
at this time is just getting
the lines in.
Mystique, she's working
double time.
both: Disco Extra-Greasy.
- I think Mystique's doing
a fabulous job.
I am surprised.
I like her a lot.
- Greasy--
- [hissing]
- So are you happy
with who you picked?
- Yes. I think
this is the best team.
Mystique, she fucking swallowed
that basket like the only one.
- She took the basket
and went "gulp."
- Words are words.
People think words don't hurt
'cause they're just words,
but when you hear it
every day...
Fuck everybody else.
- Okay, everybody.
One more time.
Go ahead, Jessica.
- Anna Grain--
Grain Annie?
- Granny.
- "Granny ain't," right?
- No, Granny's separate.
Granny is just one person.
- Oh, Aunt Judy.
Always in my life, when I want
something, it's not easy,
but I am going to keep going,
and I am going to work.
- Howdy.
all: Howdy-do, Ru?
- So this is the McCoys,
isn't it?
- Yes, ma'am.
- The Real McCoys.
You think you know your lines?
- Yes.
- I'd love to hear 'em.
- Welcome to another
home-fried meal,
courtesy of Disco
Extra-Greasy Shortening.
- Auntie, what's for dinner?
- It's your favorite, Ellie Mae.
- Why, it's so delicious.
- And crispy too.
- And crispy too!
- Now, McCoys,
what's your biggest concern
going into this challenge?
- My group from the previous
challenge was in the bottom.
- Right.
- And now that I'm team leader,
I don't want my group to be
in the bottom.
I'm up on the chopping block.
If I'm in the bottom group,
then I'm up for elimination.
You know?
And I think the person in charge
should be...
- Are you basing your characters
on people
in real life or television?
- My mom.
I'm just kidding.
- Is it a sexy Disco Critter?
- It's a fun, funky, fresh,
and country Disco Critter.
But it's gonna be more
of, like, a...
I guess you could say a--
a chicken.
- Uh-huh.
- It's a chicken.
There's no way
to make this pretty.
- All right, McCoys, well,
carry on.
I'll let you finish
getting ready.
- I'm really confident.
I think we're gonna win.
- Well, hello, Hatfields.
- Hey, Ru.
- Hi!
- Come on over and talk to me.
I want to hear about
your characterizations.
Now, I asked the other kids
to do an impromptu
table reading.
You think you're prepared enough
to do one for me?
- I'm not ready.
- And action.
- Welcome to another m--
Ugh.
Welcome to another fried, hot,
meal.
The...
Ooh.
- It's that
Billie Joe McAllister.
He...
He says I like fish.
- Every Hatfield woman does.
She does,
and there's another line.
Ain't that right, Granny?
- That's right.
We all love fish.
- I don't know if it was just
the pressure of doing it
in front of RuPaul, but it just
really just flopped.
- Still a little bit
underprepared for the challenge.
Jessica, did you choose
your role,
or was your role assigned
to you?
- No, my leader.
- And you chose Jessica
to have a role
with so many lines because...
- I know she'll turn it out
and have fun with it.
- Uh-huh.
- I'm nervous that if we fail,
I'm gonna go down,
because I'm the captain.
I'm responsible for everything.
- McCoys, can you come over
to this table?
Gather round, kids.
Ladies, in a moment, you'll be
shooting your commercials.
And I'm sending in a pro
to help coach you
with your performances.
You'll be working with
our special guest judge
Kathy Najimy.
- Whoo!
- One last thing.
There's a little twist.
I want you to swap scripts.
So now the Hatfields
will be the McCoys,
and the McCoys will be
the Hatfields.
- She switches
the fucking scripts.
- Sorry for the last-minute
change, but that's showbiz.
- We're definitely gagging.
- Don't fuck it up, y'all.
Bye.
all: Bye.
- It really pissed me off.
Because we're now having
to not only
learn new lines
but get dressed.
Oh.
- Here we go.
Let's start again.
- This is gonna separate
the girls from the women, honey.
- It's time for Team McCoy
to do our commercial.
We look ugly, fabulous,
and we're owning it.
- Oh, how "purdy" you are.
Of course you know Kathy Najimy.
- Hi.
- She will be directing
the commercial for you all.
- All right,
we're gonna kick butt
on this, okay, you guys?
- I can't believe
she's standing
in the same room that I'm in.
I'm just--I just want to pee
everywhere, just soak myself.
- Here we go, people.
- I am going to feel that I am
a<i> pollo,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
so the chicken enter fierce.
- Take one.
- Hi!
Welcome to another
home-fried meal
courtesy of Disco
Extra-Greasy Shortening!
- Cut.
That was great.
Go a little slower,
'cause we really
want to understand
what you're saying. Okay.
- Welcome to another
home-fried meal!
- Wait, can you stop?
Can we cut?
Can you--
is it "home-fried male"?
Is it "home-fried male"?
- Home-fried meal.
- Meal. Okay.
-<i> Comida!</i>
- Thought she was gonna
fry up a boy.
- Hi!
Welcome to another
home-fried meal!
- Howdy, Auntie.
What's for dinner?
- It's your favorite, Ellie Mae.
- Is it a Tic Tac?
- Cut.
Ellie Mae--everything she's
saying
should be sex, sex, sex,
even though she's saying
something else.
- What's for dinner?
- It's your favorite, Ellie Mae.
- Auntie, I want you to chain
smoke through the whole thing.
- It's Granny McCoy's famous
fried chicken.
- Cut.
Lots of energy, people.
- What is it, Auntie?
- Oh, please tell her.
The suspense is boring me
to pieces.
When I'm on stage performing,
I tend to use my body a lot,
and this was all face.
That Ellie Mae's dumber than
a box of rocks, ain't she?
- Baby, can you make a tiny bit
of a more baby voice?
- Like this?
- Yeah.
- Oh, please tell her.
The suspense is boring me
to pieces.
- I lost my line.
Okay, I got it. I got it.
I got it.
- And go.
Action.
- Shit.
I really did lose it this time.
Wait. Hold on.
- We just need
to pick up the speed.
We only have 30 minutes.
- My secret ingredient
is Disco Greasy Shortening.
- And cut.
- That's a real moment
that she could take.
- Yeah.
Grandma, when she says
"something special,"
give me a little of this.
Like, "Of course
you got something special."
- That's the same age I was
when I won your cousin's heart
thanks to Granny's
special ingredient.
- Cut.
- Granny didn't beam with pride
when...
- When I said the thing,
which is the third time.
Does not take direction well.
Grandma, if you don't
turn your head
when they say
"special ingredient,"
I'm gonna run through this thing
and turn it for you.
You have a minute to show
America who your characters are,
so you have to really
pump 'em up.
- I'm super stoked.
Welcome to another
home-fried meal.
- Cut.
Critter, we need more energy
and comedy from you, 'cause you
are in a chicken outfit,
but you're doing a very--
sort of a Meryl Streep thing.
Let's think of a chicken voice.
- I'm thinking the whole time
country accent, Southern accent,
and then I'm told,
"Don't do that;
sound like a chicken."
Welcome to another fun-filled
evening--oh, shit.
- Exit and come on again.
- Marker.
- Welcome to another--
oh, shit.
I think I could sell ice
to an Eskimo
but not dressed as
a fucking chicken.
- Chicken, did you do your own
makeup?
'Cause you look a little like
the Joker.
It's scaring me a little bit.
I always like the funny.
- I realize that you're
directing us,
but at the same time, like,
make it seem a little more fun.
- Marker.
- Welcome to another
home-fried meal
courtesy of Disco's Extra--
- Cut. Disco.
Remember,
the money is "Disco."
- Every take, they were telling
her to be energetic,
be energetic.
They should only
have to tell you one time.
- [imitating crying]
- Oh, what's happening?
- Oh, Auntie--
- Cut.
Ellie Mae, when you're
coming in, it's--
I feel like you just saw
an alien
or there's something crawling up
your bottom.
Ellie Mae, she's just all sex
and sad
but not totally freaked out.
- Sexy sad.
- Sexy sad.
And you are the sexiest thing
in the world, right?
You know how to do that.
- Oh, Auntie.
I just had the worst day ever.
- Poor dumb Ellie Mae.
Who's gonna tell her that
she smells like fish?
- 'Course you like eating fish.
All the Hatfield women do.
- Cut.
Auntie, what's your character,
honey?
- She thinks
she's kind of the boss.
- Okay, then more of that.
- Okay.
- And then, Baby,
I was gonna tell you to do
a high voice but don't.
You go lower and deeper
and madder.
It's hilarious.
You're the baby
just out of prison.
I love it.
- [laughs]
- Billie Joe says
it ain't natural
to like fish
so much.
- Well, that's because
he hasn't had a taste
of Granny Hatfield's
fresh fried fish.
- Auntie, meaner and louder.
- Sonique kept falling
in and out of character.
She didn't stay in character
when the cameras were rolling.
- Do it again.
- The quickest way
to a man's heart
is through his stomach.
- Especially when I make it
with Disco
Extra-Greasy Shortening.
- Okay, take it back.
Faster, louder,
and, Granny, turn towards me.
You're really funny,
but I want to see you.
Feel it.
You are your characters.
- You should invite Billie Joe
over here
so he can get a taste
of my fish.
- With Disco, you'll get there
in no time.
[record scratches]
- Granny, did you really
just put shortening
in your crotch?
- Morgan--
she wasn't funny at all.
She was crude.
- A little less
with the crotch shots,
just 'cause
it's a family commercial.
Okay, Baby,
don't change a thing.
- He says I like eating fish.
- Poor dumb Ellie Mae.
- It is awful good.
both: And crispy too.
- Mmm-mmm!
- Great.
- Good job.
- I'm happy, and I'm confident
with what my team did,
and hopefully the judges
will see that.
- Good work, Hatfields
and McCoys.
Now, as Kathy knows,
in show business,
the last shot of the day
is called the martini shot,
and this is yours.
Please enjoy
some Absolut cocktails.
Now, dolls, you were asked
to bring your best country duds
from home, and tomorrow you'll
get the chance
to wear them
on the main stage.
We'll be joined by our
extra-special guest judge,
country legend Tanya Tucker.
- I love Tanya Tucker.
Her fashion is fierce.
- Whoo!
- The theme of tonight's
runway presentation
is country couture,
country glamour,
country realness.
- The only country I know
is my aunt,
and she's, like,
the most country-est person
in the world.
But she has so many
personalities.
So I'm like,
"I want to give
all the versions of my aunt
in one."
But this isn't country,
right?
- Depends on what kind of
country look you're going for.
- The first time that I ever
did drag in front of my friends
in high school was during
this Halloween party.
I thought I looked sexy, girl,
and then I--yeah, no.
I had, like, this afro on,
balloon boobies.
My best friend--
- You did balloon boobies too?
- I sure did.
- Girl, no, I have never done
drag in high school.
- I did drag in middle school.
- Girl, we know.
You came out the womb
putting on makeup.
- I know.
- Do you feel like a woman,
or do you feel
like a drag queen?
- A little bit of both.
I mean, when you're in drag,
don't--
you don't just feel
like a drag queen.
Sometimes you might feel
a little bit more womanly
one day.
You might feel a little bit
more fierce.
- I feel like a drag queen
when I'm in drag.
- I feel like a performer,
and that's it.
- Girl, your cheeks
are really ashy.
- What, right here?
- Yeah.
- Girl, I haven't dust yet.
- Uh, it's obvious.
You cooking?
- It's on slow roast.
Like that chicken we have.
- Best chicken, Granny.
- It's all in this can.
- She like,
"It's all in this can!"
- The reason
why I started doing drag
is because I always thought
I was cute.
I have never in my life
been told I was cute as a guy.
Never.
Mystique is pretty.
Everybody loves Mystique.
- I look around the room.
I see everybody looks like
a country diva.
And then I see
what Mystique is wearing.
She looks like she's a big girl
going out to a club.
I don't think the hat goes
with the outfit...
- Yeah, I know.
- Personally.
But you're a queen yourself,
so you choose.
Mm-mm.
[RuPaul laughing]
[applause]
- Oh, my Lord.
- Hi, everyone.
Santino, how are you, baby?
- What's that flower you got on?
- I feel like an ice-cold glass
of country-style lemonade.
[laughter]
- Pink lemonade.
- Ladies and gentlemen,
we have
Miss Tanya Tucker
in the house tonight.
- Whoo!
- Thank you so much.
- Oh, love it.
Hey, Miss Kathy.
- Hello, my darling.
- This week we asked the ladies
to put the charisma, uniqueness,
nerve, and talent
back in country
as two feuding teams
to shoot a TV commercial for
Disco Extra-Greasy Shortening.
Tonight, they come
to the main stage
decked out in their best
denim and diamond couture.
Judges, are you ready to see
what they turned out?
- Ready.
- Whoo-hoo.
- Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best woman win.
Sonique.
-<i> Sonique is everything</i>
<i>that I feel on the inside.</i>
<i>When you feel good</i>
<i>on the inside, it shows.</i>
- Wow.
- She's working it.
A little Tanya Tucker.
- Yeah.
- Ooh.
- The devil went down
to Georgia.
Jujubee.
-<i> During my runway,</i>
<i>all I can think about is,</i>
<i>"Mama, you have to hit this."</i>
- She's popping her cherry
again?
- She's popping her cherry
again.
Raven.
- That's so not Raven.
- I know, right?
- Yeah, the Guess girl.
- I've never seen her
so sweet-looking.
-<i> I feel adorable.</i>
<i>Like a cherry</i>
<i>on top of a cupcake.</i>
- The girl next door.
- Well, next door to what?
- Best little whorehouse
in Texas.
[laughter]
- Sahara.
That much leg
should be against the law.
-<i> I'm a dancer, so of course</i>
<i>I'm gonna try</i>
<i>and incorporate that</i>
<i>every chance I get.</i>
<i>A little bootin',</i>
<i>a little shuffle.</i>
- Y'all come back now, ya hear?
All right, Mommy.
-<i> I wanted to do country,</i>
<i>but I wanted it to have</i>
<i>an urban twist.</i>
- It's kind of like Raquel Welch
went to the country.
- Well, you know, it's hard
to keep 'em on the farm
after they've been
to<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
- That's hard.
- Pandora Boxx.
Cowgirl hall of fame.
-<i> I'm feeling like my outfit</i>
<i>is cute and country.</i>
- This ain't her first time at
the rodeo.
- Even cowgirls get the blues.
- Oh.
Jessica Wild.
-<i> I feel good</i>
<i>because I feel sexy.</i>
<i>I feel that</i>
<i>I am in the country.</i>
- Our little Jessica's
growing up.
She's filling out her jeans.
Her Apple Bottom jeans.
Mystique.
Star Jones before the pilates.
-<i> My strategy in the game</i>
<i>is pretty much to stand out.</i>
<i>To be totally different</i>
<i>from everybody else.</i>
<i>So it can work in my favor.</i>
- Yes, yes.
Uh-huh.
And do-si-do, Mama.
Morgan McMichaels.
The look of today's
country girl.
- Kind of new,
romantic country.
-<i> I think there's just</i>
<i>a one-track mind</i>
<i>about what country is.</i>
<i>You don't have to be Podunk</i>
<i>to be country.</i>
- Aren't they gorgeous,
those boots?
Tyra Sanchez, the other Tyra.
-<i> I try to give the judges</i>
<i>another side of me every week.</i>
- Whoo!
- Flip off that skirt!
- Whoo!
- I'll change
at the gas station, Mama.
You won't even know.
- Wow.
Oh, yes.
Now she's Super Tyra.
I'll take one in every color.
Hello, my country queens.
Let's take a look
at the world premiere
of your Disco Extra-Greasy
Shortening commercial.
- Welcome to another
home-fried meal
courtesy of Disco
Extra-Greasy Shortening.
-<i> Howdy, Auntie.</i>
<i>What's for dinner?</i>
-<i> It's your favorite--</i>
<i>Granny McCoy's</i>
<i>famous fried chicken.</i>
-<i> My secret is right in</i>
<i>this can.</i>
-<i> Ain't that Disco Extra-Greasy</i>
<i>Shortening?</i>
-<i> Sure is, Ellie Mae.</i>
-<i> The quickest way to a man's</i>
<i>heart is through his stomach.</i>
-<i> And with Disco</i>
<i>Extra-Greasy Shortening,</i>
<i>you'll get there in no time.</i>
-<i> This is so delicious.</i>
<i>all: And crispy too!</i>
-<i> Put some crispy</i>
<i>in your cock a "doddle" doo</i>
<i>with Disco</i>
<i>Extra-Greasy Shortening!</i>
Whoo!
- Our commercial was hilarious.
I loved it.
- Let's take a look
at the world premiere
of your Disco Extra-Greasy
Shortening commercial.
-<i> Welcome to another</i>
<i>home-fried meal courtesy</i>

<i>Shortening.</i>
-<i> Oh, Auntie.</i>
<i>It's that mean</i>
<i>Billie Joe McAllister.</i>
<i>He been picking on me all day.</i>
<i>He says I like eating fish.</i>
-<i> Poor dumb Ellie Mae.</i>
<i>Who's gonna tell her that</i>
<i>she smells like fish too?</i>
-<i> That's because</i>
<i>he hasn't tried</i>
<i>Granny Hatfield's</i>
<i>fried fish fillets.</i>
-<i> Especially when I make it</i>

<i>Shortening.</i>
-<i> Well, if you ask me,</i>
<i>it ain't just the fish</i>

-<i> The quickest way to a man's</i>

-<i> It is awful good.</i>
both:<i> And crispy too.</i>
<i>Mmm-mmm.</i>
-<i> Add some crispy</i>

<i>with Disco Extra-Greasy</i>
<i>Shortening.</i>
<i>Cock a doodle doo!</i>
- So Hatfields, McCoys,
both of your commercials
have highlights
and lowlights.
But I do have a favorite.
And that is...
The McCoys.
Good work.
[applause]
Now this week,
we had you work as teams.
But tonight each of you
will be judged
on your individual performance.
In other words,
no one is safe.
When I call your name,
please step forward.
Sonique.
Jujubee.
Morgan McMichaels.
Tatianna.
Sahara Davenport.
You girls, you are safe.
Congratulations.
You may leave the stage.
The five of you represent
the best and the worst
of the week.
Let's begin
our judges' critiques.
Let's start with Raven.
- I did think the performance
was a little
all over the map.
- It was kind of a mixed bag.
I didn't actually know
if you knew
that you were kind of playing
an animal or a chicken.
- Well, when we were practicing,
I didn't realize that
I should do it as a chicken.
- What did you think
you were gonna do it as?
- Well, do the voice
as a chicken.
- Now, Kathy,
you directed Raven in the piece.
- I directed Raven
in the piece.
PS, you look so cute.
I could put you in a smoothie
and drink you.
But I also sense
a real seriousness about you.
Honey, you have to look
around you.
This is just a bowl
full of fun soup.
Lighten up a little bit
and have a good time.
- All right, next up,
Jessica Wild.
Show us your Apple Bottom jeans.
- My Apple Bottom...
- Hey.
- Yeah, I want to mount her.
You are giving thoroughbred
realness today.
[laughter]
- What'd you think of her
as the Disco Critter?
- I thought she did a good job
with your language.
I can barely speak English,
so...
- Put some crispy
in your cock a "doddle" doo!
I love my character
because I love the Muppets,
so I feel like I am a Muppet.
- Thank you, my dear.
Pandora Boxx,
did you make this outfit,
or did you buy it?
- Um, it's bought,
but then I took the fabric
that we had for all the costumes
and added the little lady.
- Ah, crafty.
- I love your outfit.
I love what you did to it.
And it kind of--
kind of reminds me of me.
- Santino.
- Oh.
I'm not gonna be your favorite.
It almost looks like
you're in a child pageant
or something.
I'm thinking, like, you read,
like, 12 or 13,
and then I'm, like--I'm just
kind of creeped out.
- I don't think Pandora
is a fashion girl.
But what I do get all over
from Pandora is comedy.
I thought you were
the funniest person, actually.
- The quickest way
to a man's heart
is through his stomach.
- It was definitely fun to do.
It was kind of my element.
- Very funny.
Mystique Summers Madison.
Are you feeling Southern?
- I went with how my friends
back home dressed as,
since they're country.
- Well, I hear
what you're saying,
but it's not really sort of
the country look.
- I want to stand out
by going as
the normal, mall-wear country.
- [laughs]
- As the country girls--where--
where they still can have on
a nice shirt.
- Isn't this the same top
you wore in the challenge,
though?
- Yes, this is a skirt,
a one-piece skirt.
And I made it more updated
with the gauchos
and everything.
- Why the fuck
did you wear that
and try and make up
some bullshit fucking story?
- I love the way you do
your runway.
I thought your runway
was great.
- It almost seems like
you're twirling even more
because you know that your
outfit is not working today.
- When you walked out just now,
I said,
"I totally forgot
that you're not female."
I just thought, "Well, there's
that gorgeous woman."
It's a bummer about the outfit.
That's a bummer.
- Tyra Sanchez, you tore it up,
Miss Thing.
- I think
some maybe had a hard time
coming up with one outfit.
You came up with three looks
that you gave us.
The only thing
I would ask you is,
when you transform into Tyra,
why doesn't your voice change?
- Well, I can't go higher.
I can try for you.
- What's the highest note
you can hit?
- Happy birthday,
Mr. President.
- Happy birthday, Mr. President.
- That's--that's totally
believable.
- Let's talk about
your commercial.
You played the baby.
- I actually thought about
my own son.
He wakes up
in the middle of the night
out of nowhere and just like,
"Can I have some water?"
And by the time
I get the water
and bring it back to him,
he's asleep again.
- Well, all right.
Ladies, while you enjoy
an Absolut cocktail
in the Interior Illusions
Lounge,
the judges and I
will deliberate.
Thank you.
[engine starts]
Let's talk about Mystique.
- She's got that
really pretty face.
The only problem I had
was the outfit.
- Yeah.
- So far off the mark.
- Yeah.
- Stood out
in all the wrong ways.
- That outfit--
that was inexcusable.
- Yeah.
- And then having to explain
why...
[laughs]
Not good. Not good.
Okay, so we're gonna go on
over to Tyra.
She's a gorgeous gal.
- Yes.
- She's clearly inventive
with her presentation.
Do you think Tyra's voice
is working against her?
- I think just a little bit.
- She has a very deep voice.
- Because when you look at her,
there's nothing--
I can't see anything wrong.
- Yeah.
Let's talk about Raven.
Didn't do so well
in the commercial.
- I missed the funny.
Obviously
you're in a chicken suit.
That's the first clue
to be funny.
- Raven looked so beautiful
on the runway,
but I thought,
as the Disco Critter,
Jessica did a better job
than Raven did.
- Yes.
Jessica Wild
is from Puerto Rico,
doesn't speak the language
very well,
and she seemed to master
the Disco Critter very well.
- She just went wild.
- I find her really charming
and a great, spicy addition
to this lineup.
- Yes.
- But is she America's
next drag superstar?
That's the question
we have to ask.
- I don't know.
- Pandora Boxx.
Santino had an issue...
- Hate, hate.
- With Pandora Boxx's outfit.
- It's just very just,
uh, pedestrian.
- She is a fantastic comedienne.
- My favorite to work with.
She's got--she's got
some comedy going.
- Silence.
I've made my decision.
Bring back the girls.
Ladies, welcome back.
Pandora, if you want to win
this race,
you need to step up your style.
You're safe.
You may join the other girls.
Mystique, you were slow
to make adjustments on set
during the commercial.
When we asked you to give us
your best country couture,
you came up empty-handed.
I'm sorry.
You're up for elimination.
- I knew this was probably
gonna happen this way.
They didn't see me as
their version
of country realness.
You can't please everybody.
- Jessica.
You're safe.
You may join the other girls.
Raven.
I see flashes of star power
in you.
But as quickly as it comes,
it fades away.
Do you have the consistency
to be the next
drag superstar?
I'm sorry, but you're up for
elimination.
- So once again
I'm in the bottom two.
Honestly, I don't feel like
I belong in the bottom two
with Mystique.
- Tyra Sanchez,
your runway was a hit.
And your Baby Girl
made me laugh out loud.
Congratulations.
You're the winner
of this challenge.
[applause]
Which means you have immunity
next week.
Plus you'll receive a collection
of designer bags,
handmade in Italian leather,
from M. Clifford Designs.
Congratulations, Tyra.
You may join the other girls.
- This is the first challenge
that I won,
and I feel great.
I feel amazing.
Because last week they were
making me out
to be a bitch of the group.
And I'm not a bitch.
I'm America's sweetheart.
- Two queens stand before me.
I've consulted with the judges.
But the final decision
is mine to make.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me
and save yourself
from elimination.
The time has come
for you
to lip synch for your life.
Good luck, and remember...
Don't fuck it up.
[country rock music]
-<i> Lip synch area is my stage.</i>
<i>That's my battleground.</i>
And I'm gonna go balls
to the wall.
-<i> I was gonna duke it out.</i>
<i>I don't care</i>
<i>if the wig flew off.</i>
<i>I don't care if I broke a heel.</i>
<i>At that point,</i>
<i>it was do or die,</i>
'cause I was not gonna go home
up against Mystique.
[applause]
- Whoo!
- Mystique...
Raven...
I've made my decision.
Raven, you've been
down this road twice.
But you keep pulling through.
And it's that kind of resilience
it takes to win this race.
Shante.
You stay.
- Thank you very much.
Thank you.
If I was told to sashay away
and Mystique is still standing
up there,
I would have
fucking slit my wrists.
- Mystique Summers Madison,
I want you to believe
in yourself, because I do.
Now sashay away.
[laughter]
- Got it, girl.
Good job.
-<i> I'm not gonna change</i>
<i>who I am</i>
<i>to win a competition.</i>
I'm gonna be Mystique.
<i>Take me as I am</i>
<i>or nothing at all.</i>
<i>So I'm going home</i>
<i>with my head held up high.</i>
- Dolls, like every good
country song,
we will live through
this heartache.
Mystique is gone,
but we will carry on
in the tradition
of all great country queens.
Now remember,
if you can't love yourself,
how in the hell are you gonna
love somebody else?
Can I get an amen in here?
all: Amen.
- Let the music play!
[dance music]


-<i> Previously on</i>
Rupaul's Drag Race...
- Hey!
[all screaming]
- Sahara and I have
been friends forever.
- I hope that I don't fall
into that role of babysitting
when I should be really, like,
cutting their bra straps.
- You must create
your best drag look
using just these curtains.
Oh-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
You have a child?
- I do have a son.
My son is, like,
my major motivation
for winning this competition.
- All right!
She is throwing
some serious 'shay.
Morgan McMichaels, you are
the winner of this challenge.
You will receive immunity.
- I don't fucking
like being just safe.
- Mystique, based on your
unforgettable presentation,
I'm giving you
a get out of jail free card.
Sahara Davenport, Shangela,
the time has come for you
to lip sync for your life.
- Ohh!
- Sahara Davenport,
Shante, you stay.
Shangela, sashay away.
<i>And tonight...</i>
today, I'm gonna
give you a chance
to street walk
a mile in my shoes.
<i>Wigs will fly.</i>
- You stuck me with these
fuckin' bitches.
-<i> And heads will turn.</i>
- I think we might be
in trouble.
- Help me.
-<i> With extra special</i>
<i>guest judges</i>
<i>Kim Coles and Dita Von Teese.</i>
- [cheering]
-<i> The winner of Rupaul's</i>
<i>Drag Race will receive</i>
<i>a lifetime supply</i>

And may the best woman win!
[alarm clock beeping]
- Walking into the workroom
this morning
was a little weird 'cause we
didn't have Shangela with us.
- Sahara?
- Yes, darling?
- Here's Shangela's face.
- Ohh!
What am I gonna do with it?
I'm trying to take the attitude
that it's a clean slate.
Trying not to have the weight
of what happened the other night
on my shoulders.
She's gone,
so we won't need this anymore.
This is now my station, guys.
[siren wails]
-<i> Ooh, girl!</i>
<i>You got shemail.</i>
<i>Good morning, racers.</i>
<i>It's RuPaul here with your</i>
<i>drag-u-weather forecast.</i>
- All right.
-<i> This week, we can expect</i>
<i>a</i><span style="bodyStyle"> high-pressure system,</i>
<i>followed by storms of,</i>
<i>"Hell no!"</i>
<i>"Oh, no, she di'n't,"</i>
<i>and, "What you call me, bitch?"</i>
<i>but before this week is over,</i>
<i>I guarantee with 100% accuracy</i>
<i>somebody in here</i>
<i>is gonna make it rain.</i>
<i>All right?</i>
<i>Okay?</i>
- Make it rain.
- Rain?
- Hey, girls.
[cheers and applause]
Now, today I'm gonna
give you a chance
to street walk
a mile in my shoes.
Oh, dear!
Today's mini-challenge
is a makeover,
where you'll be turning
a lady into a tramp.
The lady in question is me.
[gasps and laughter]
Or, as I like to say, mini-Ru.
[laughter and applause]
Now, as you girls see, there are
only six supermodel dolls,
so you'll be working in pairs.
And there's
an odd number of you,
which means one person
will be working alone.
Now take a moment
to choose a partner.
- We'll do it together.
- The Atlanta girls
are working together?
- Let's do it?
- Hell, yeah.
- Raven and Morgan?
- New York!
- New York?
Okay, yeah.
Tyra and Jujubee.
Jessica and Tatianna.
- I'm alone.
- Mystique works alone.
- Always.
- Ladies, you'll have
30 minutes for your makeover.
Feel free to use the materials
we've provided.
Now, when I return,
I want to see
these little ladies turned
into six bad girls
that work hard for the money,
if you know what I mean.
Are you ready?
Set...
go.
- My number one goal was to grab
the whole plate of fabric.
- Tyra and I ended up
with most of the stuff.
- We had got what we wanted,
and then let everyone
get our sloppy seconds.
- We did not get left nothing.
I got, like,
one handful of scraps.
Oh, my God!
- 30 minutes, bitch.
- Okay.
- I think her heel
should be broken.
- [laughs] Definitely, yeah.
- What about these boots?
- I think she needs
hooker heels.
- But I seen hookers
out there with boots on.
- I love working with Tyra,
but sometimes he just kind of
wants to do
what Tyra wants to do.
- The purse should
match the shoes.
- No, it shouldn't match
the shoes, diva.
- These are not heels.
These are rhinestones.
- She's tucked real good.
[laughing]
I think what I'm gonna
miss most being here
and not in Atlanta is
the fact that I won't be able
to spend day-to-day time
with my son, Lucas,
who's 3 1/2, and I miss him.
We play every day.
- Hello, dolly.
- Uh-oh!
- Wow! [laughs]
- Where's the glitter?
Where's the glitter?
Where's the glitter?
- You use all my glitter.
- Yeah, I'm sorry.
- You tramp.
- Work.
- Glue these shoes on.
- Okay, ladies, time's up.
It is time to reveal
your makeovers.
- I got Shaquanda here.
- Uh-huh.
I call her
a broke-down stripper.
When she want to be naughty,
all you got to do
is turn her around,
she's ready for access.
- Hey!
- With her nice little
rose tattoo.
- Tatianna and Jessica.
- This is both of us.
She's got my eyes, but her lips.
- What is this doll's name?
- Wild Whore.
- [laughing]
- Wild Whore.
- Pandora and Sahara.
- Our girl is called
Shafreeforal.
She's had a little bit
of a rough night.
She has lost her shoe.
[RuPaul laughing]
- Her other heel is broken,
but she still has
the heel in her hand.
She hasn't lost it.
- It's her good shoe.
- Yes.
- Sonique
and Nicole Paige Brooks.
- Well, you said
it could be a bad girl,
so the baddest bitch we know
is my drag mother
Shawna Brooks,
so she's styled after her.
- Wow, look at that.
- Yes, with the matching boots,
and always one titty out.
- Tyra and Jujubee.
- This is Cherry.
- Oh, Cherry.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Oh, wow.
- And she has one tooth missin'.
- That's okay, girl.
Is that a skirt?
- Um, it's a skort.
- Look, she is dealin'
crack back here.
- More hair to comb,
more cheeks to powder.
That's all it is.
- That's right.
That's what we tell her.
- Morgan and Raven?
- This is Lady Mayhem
from the House of Chaos.
- Gorgeous,
look how cute that is.
- Just a little, tiny thong
with a nice sequined strap.
- All right, ladies,
that was quite the show.
The winning team is...
Pandora Boxx
and Sahara Davenport.
[applause]
Miss Shafreeforal.
- Shafreeforal won!
- Congratulations, girls.
Now, this week's
main stage challenge
is inspired by my feature film
<i>Starrbooty,</i>
where I play
an undercover hustler.
Word, holla, hey!
And a diva is a female version
of a hustler.
This is your chance to unleash
your inner pussycat doll
and to show us that you can use
your brains and your beauty
to make it rain.
In two teams,
you'll be competing
as burlesque dancers.
You'll be judged on your ability
to work as an individual
and in a group.
Pandora, Sahara, since you won
the mini-challenge,
you are team captains.
Pandora, who do you pick first?
- Uh, Morgan.
- Ooh, yay.
- Sahara?
- Jessica.
- Jessica!
- Sonique.
- Jujubee.
- Raven.
- They was going after the girls
who are skinny
and go out there naked.
I'm not all, "Oh, my God,
they didn't pick me,"
cry, cry, cry.
No, it's not my personality.
This ain't high school.
- Tyra.
- Tyra?
- I wanted to be
in Pandora's group.
She had all the tall,
skinny, pretty bitches.
- Tatianna.
- Tatianna!
[applause]
Sahara, your choice.
- We're gonna go with Mystique.
- It's all about the titties.
- And that leaves
Nicole Paige Brooks.
- Save the best for last.
I was picked last, which I was
really surprised about,
to be honest.
- Nicole was left last
because this is a sexy contest,
and she's not sexy.
- In a moment, you'll meet
two top burlesque performers.
They're gonna give you
a crash course
in pole dancing,
with poles provided
by Platinum Stages,
plus each team
will be responsible
for styling
your burlesque outfits,
using materials courtesy of
Michael Levine Fabrics.
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman...
win!
- We're gonna go with one print
'cause they don't match.
- I know they don't speak,
but it fits.
A girl in this on stage,
a girl in this, a girl in this,
a girl in this, and then another
girl in that,
and then that'll go fine.
You get what I'm sayin'?
- I don't like that.
I want us all to be in the same.
We're gonna all be in the same.
- Guys, we really need
to work as a team,
'cause I'm gonna
get frustrated.
Tyra's being difficult.
"I want this, I want this,"
it's all about her.
- Can I say something,
team captain?
- Sure. What is it, darling?
- This red fabric
that you chose?
- Uh-huh?
- It's shitty.
Like, really shitty.
- Tyra!
- Do you guys need a extra
person in your group?
- We're tired of all
your bitching out there.
- Pandora?
- Yeah?
- Do you not like me?
You didn't choose me
to be in your group.
I was hoping and praying
that you would choose me.
- I'm sorry.
- Now, look, you stuck me
with these fucking bitches.
- Oh, my God, I am in a group
with, like, Satan's baby.
- Our challenge
is to create a burlesque act.
We're getting
pole-dancing lessons.
- Today, we're going to be
teaching you a few basic tricks.
- Oh, Lord.
[laughing]
Here we go.
- Gorgeous.
[applause]
There was a lot of vagina
in my face. [laughs]
I was like...
- Ladies, this is dropping it
like it's hot.
- Oh, my God!
- How do expect me to do that?
It doesn't move on me.
- Well, so who wants
to get started?
Any volunteers?
- La-la-la-la-la!
I'm a flexible bitch
that can drop it like it's hot.
We gonna get on the pole
and do a upside down butterfly,
just have fun with it.
- Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Ohh!
- Wow!
- Very good.
- Whoo!
- Wow!
[applause]
- [laughs]
That ain't sexy.
I want to try that again.
Your titties
are distracting me.
- I'm sorry. They--
that's what they're there for.
- Nicole is really sexy
and really sexual,
so I'm not really worried
about being, you know,
a tease,
'cause it's kind of what I do.
- Release and spin.
Much better!
Very good.
See?
That was awesome.
- Nicole cannot bring sexy back.
- Anybody else?
Come on, girl.
- Tyra, go.
- I can't.
- Oh, Tyra, go.
- I cannot do that.
- You have to do something.
- The way that I learn
is by watching others do it.
I'm not going to get up there
and just use
someone else's ideas.
- I'm the group leader,
and we all know
that the group leader's
the first one to go down,
so I am just hoping and praying
that everyone pulls through,
especially Miss Tyra.
Now how you guys feel
about the dancing?
Are y'all gonna be
okay with that?
- I feel like a whore slut.
- Is that a bad thing?
- Yes, that's a bad thing.
- But you're a bad girl,
remember?
- But I'm a bad girl,
I'm not a bad slut.
I feel that pole dancing, um,
it's kind of a little ho'-ish.
- I think we should just be
very positive about it,
and then it'll all come
together.
- It's fine,
as long as everyone cooperates.
There's no "I" in "team,"
after all, right?
- But there's a "me," girl.
- So far, I'm not quite clickin'
with the choreography,
just 'cause I want someone
to really, like,
slow it down for me so I get it.
- Pandora's just kind of
standing off to the side.
She's not really doing much,
so I tell Morgan,
"Girl, you should
choreograph this."
- I'm not trying to be bitchy,
but if you want, like,
choreography done,
like, let us do it.
There was a lot
of confusion going on,
and the time was
running out.
- I'm not reading you, by any
means, but you know what I mean?
Like, it's so confusing.
- Yeah, I mean, I'm just trying
to set it up at the beginning,
that's it.
- I went into shut-down mode
for a little bit,
because everybody
was just talking,
and it was very frustrating
and irritating.
I was like, "Oh, Christ."
- The two weakest people
should be in the back.
- Yeah.
- That's just an opinion.
- Okay, well,
let's just practice this,
and then as we figure out
who the weakest is
we'll move 'em around.
- Okay, let's try this.
Ready?
- I could be a bigger bitch.
- So can I, girl.
Miss Tyra decides that she
can't rehearse in heels.
- Are you gonna have me
rehearse like this?
You're gonna have me complainin'
about my feet hurtin'.
I know how my body works.
- Five, six, seven, eight...
- I'm just sitting back.
I'm puttin' everything
together in my head.
I'm sayin', okay, girl,
do this and do that.
Like if they asked me now,
"Girl, do the routine,"
I would do it,
and I'd do it better
than what they did in there.
- We need to pick a color
that's gonna work.
- Well, if they're
not using this,
I think we should use this.
It's the most colorful,
and it's just sitting here.
- Do we need
to find out for sure
if they're not using that?
- No.
- No, they said they're done.
- 'Cause they're doing
that right there.
- This'll be hot.
- I think this is gonna pop
with black, I really do.
- Hey, that's our fabric.
She just took all our fabric.
- Because it's our fabric,
honey.
- I could have swore
you guys said
you were done with your fabric.
- No, we had all our fabric
over here that we were using.
Sorry you misunderstood.
- No, there was
no misunderstanding.
I have ears,
and they hear very well.
- No one's here to share.
We're not here to help.
We're not even here
to be friends.
- Did you need this fabric?
Well, do you need it,
or do you not need it?
- Hey.
- You owe me one.
- Thank you, darling.
- Cute, by the way.
I love them.
- Are you tryin' to be
fierce to me, Miss Tati?
- No!
I think they're cute.
- Just makin' sure, girl.
Just makin' sure.
- You think a lot, don't you?
But you think wrong
all the time.
- I do.
- You should think harder.
Thank you.
- Hi.
Hello, hello, hello.
Wow, look at this.
How's it going so far?
- I think it's going good.
- And do you feel like
you're really the leader?
- Um, I didn't
at a certain point, no.
I think that there's just
a lot of strong personalities.
- Really? Here?
- Just a few.
- Among drag queens?
- Do you feel as though
you've been an effective leader
for your team?
- Most definitely.
I think the end result
will show that as well.
- So you're okay that
one of your team members
is over there sleeping?
Are you worried?
- I am worried.
I am worried.
- Mm-hmm.
- What am I to do?
- Well, it's, you know,
hard out there for a pimp.
- Don't wake her up.
She'll scream.
- Tyra, sweetie.
Darling?
Sweetie pie.
- Tired.
- You're tired?
- Yeah.
- Why you so tired?
- I don't know.
When Ru woke me up,
I'm like, "Shit!"
- Now, why do you think
everybody else is so busy,
but you have time to nap?
- Um, they're hot-gluing.
- Uh-huh.
- And I sewed, and it took me,
like, five minutes
to make my costume.
- You know,
you will be judged on
not only your individual,
but how well you work
with the group.
- I'm good.
I'm perfectly fine.
I don't have any doubt.
- All right, get back to bed.
All right, girls,
one last thing before I go.
Now, I'm gonna take you all
on a little field trip tomorrow
to Dragonfly.
It's a hot Hollywood club,
where you'll be performing
your main challenge
in front of an audience
of 100% grade "A" men.
Beef, honey. Beef.
Now, I want you to make sure
to bring your charisma,
uniqueness,
nerve, and talent.
Bye, y'all.
See ya.
[applause]
- I'm excited to get out
and it be a room full of men.
I can't fucking wait.
- Hey, girls,
welcome to Dragonfly.
This week,
Santino, Merle, and I
are joined by our
special guest judges,
one of my favorite funny ladies,
Kim Coles is here.
[applause]
And our extra
special guest judge,
the queen of burlesque,
Dita Von Teese.
[cheers and applause]
Now, in a moment, the team
that makes the most money
will be safe
from elimination this week,
and the girl on that team
who earns the most
will be the winner,
but first, what would
<i>Rupaul's Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> be</i>
without a little twist?
Today, you'll have two ways
to earn those dollars, honey.
While one team is working on
this stage,
the other will be
selling it on the street.
You hear that, Tyra?
Not you.
I'm talkin' about Tyra Banks.
[laughter]
- I hate goin' out the door
in drag in the daytime.
- And by "it," I mean cherry pie
gift certificates.
Cherry pie
gift certificates, sir,
courtesy of Cafe Audrey.
And one more thing.
Don't fuck it up.
- We have 60 minutes to sell
some cherry pie
gift certificates.
Help me out, buy some pie.
Team strategy is to get
out there and sell, sell, sell.
- Hi, would you like
to buy a cherry pie?
- Please, please,
don't make me beg.
- Please!
I need money!
- Does anybody want cherry pie
gift certificates, $5.
I don't know how
to approach people.
No?
Do you understand me?
Can you hear--
am I here?
Anybody?
Bueller?
- Buy the pie, baby.
Buy the pie. Please buy the pie.
- I think we might be
in trouble.
- Please help me.
- We're confident.
We're the pretty girls.
We're gonna sell sex, and isn't
that the name of the game?
- Nicole was having difficulty
with the choreography.
Big and messy
is not gonna cut it.
[cheers and applause]
[applause]
- I made a lot of money.
It rained on me a few times,
and I like to be wet.
- While I'm on stage,
I'm so incredibly nervous.
My heart is going
"Whum, whum, whum."
I feel like my boob's
gonna pop right out.
[cheers and applause]
- And as you pick up
crumpled money,
it looks like a lot more
than it is.
I realize it didn't rain.
It was enough to buy
a nice dinner
at the sizzler or something.
- Cherry pie.
all: Cherry pie!
Cherry pie!
- Oh!
Also I can do that for you.
- I got a dollar.
- Thank you, yay!
- Here's one dollar.
- Thank you.
- Thanks a lot.
Thanks.
- Ooh.
Watch your--
think soprano, though,
when you talk, girl.
- Hi, would you like to buy
a slice of cherry pie?
We got cherry pie
gift certificates!
- Tyra's surprising me,
actually.
I'm like, wow,
she actually has a personality?
- Hi. Would you like to buy
a slice of cherry pie?
- $5--
thank you, sir.
- You're welcome, okay.
- I looked like a $2 whore.
My grandmother's gonna kill me.
What you want?
- Let me see you guys
do a dance for this $20.
- Okay.
- I see her from the corner
with a $20 bill,
and I'm like, "Wait!
That's mine."
- Oh, yes!
- Miss Sahara, you stealin'
this sale from me, girl?
- The audience really
kind of got into it.
[cheers]
- They were all loving it,
eating out of
the palm of my hand.
I felt kind of like
I might have been
the skankiest on stage.
- I'm a nervous wreck
being in front of Dita.
She's the epitome of burlesque,
and there she is,
lookin' at you, you
know, judgin' you.
- We went out onto
Hollywood Boulevard,
and we're trying to sell
these gift certificates,
and there's Christians
and children and--oh.
I'm not cut out for this.
- You know you want
a taste of cherry pie.
- Nicole was loud.
- I'm serious, it's right there.
You're almost at Audrey's.
You know you want the pie.
- Raven, I always just kind of
saw her standing like a statue.
- You guys want to buy
cherry pie.
I can tell you love cherry pie.
- Sonique is rude.
- How much money do you have?
- Uh...
- Yes?
- Uh, well, I have some--
- You're wasting my time.
I got an hour.
- My time is expensive, too.
- All right, well,
then hit it, 'cause so is mine.
- Hey, daddy.
Nobody wants cherry pie?
- Morgan, she's like,
"Hey, daddy."
La-la-la-la.
- We like pie.
Do you like pie?
- Cherry.
- Cherry pie.
- I don't like
to carry myself like that.
I'm sweet in the streets
and, you know,
a freak in the sheets.
- Cherry...
pie.
- I look over at the judges,
and Dita Von Teese
was smiling, honey.
You can't crack her.
She sits there with this just
straight face, just beauty.
- All of our arguing
and bitching
and nagging at each other,
like, finally paid off.
- I feel excited.
I'm going to work that crowd.
- Whoo!
- Ow!
- I think I did a great job,
because I have a lot of money.
- Yeah!
- My strategy for my solo
is just to wow the crowd.
[cheers]
- Sellin' cherry pie.
Come and get it.
- Hello.
I love your hat.
- [pretending to cry]
Please, somebody buy cherry pie.
They just were running, running.
- You guys like cherry pie?
- He's running.
He's running from somebody.
They're like,
"Aah! It's a t-girl!
It's a t-girl!"
- Because I can't dance,
I figured I'd be sexual
and playful.
Every girl needs lip gloss,
right?
[cheers and applause]
- I'm thinking, do whatever it
takes to get your money.
[cheers]
[kicks stage]
- My strategy is to demand money
from the men.
- I hope it pays off.
- Ow!
- [sighs]
Are you tired?
- Very much so.
- Elimination day is today.
Everyone's on pins and needles
because no one knows
how to measure
the other team's work,
so we're just anxious
to see who's on the bottom.
- Somebody stole
my mommy's picture.
I walk in the room,
and, you know,
first thing I'm thinkin' is,
got to say hello to Shawna,
my drag mother,
and she's not on the wall.
I've been robbed!
If anybody sees a 8x10
of Shawna Brooks,
maybe it got set
on their station by accident,
'cause it was on this wall
yesterday and now it's gone.
Being away from my family
was more than
I thought it was, you know?
I have a 2 1/2-year-old, Lucas.
He's at home,
and I miss him the most.
- Are y'all gonna
let him watch the show?
- When he's, like,
four or five maybe.
Hopefully, there'll be
an appropriate one to show him.
I'm just hopin'
that he's proud of his life.
Gonna be able to show him
I am at the top of my game.
He should be proud of what
his daddy does for a living.
He's gonna be able to say,
"My daddy's a drag superstar."
[laughs] You know?
- You guys still have
all your fathers, yeah?
- My father has cancer
right now, so...
- Oh! Mine--
mine passed away of cancer.
He had lung cancer.
- I don't really know--
I mean, we don't know
how long he has.
My father was just diagnosed
with cancer.
He's, you know, on chemo
and going through all of that.
- My father was always
just really upset about it,
because he knew
he was gonna die,
and he didn't know how we were
gonna take care of ourselves.
- So sad.
- Yeah, I mean, it is,
but just this, Pandora.
Just tell him you love him.
That's all.
I don't want to talk
about this anymore.
- I don't, either.
I gotta put makeup on,
and I don't want it to smudge.
- Yeah, okay.
-There's a lot
of mixed emotions.
There's a lot of feelings
going on around the room.
People are wondering
which group's gonna be
up on the chopping block,
but still,
at the same time trying to hurry
and get ready
for the main stage.
[applause]
- Well, hello, judges.
- Hello.
- Hey, Ru.
- Have you recovered
from yesterday?
- That was insane.
- Oh!
- I thought it was fantastic.
- I enjoyed it very much.
- I wish my whole life
could be that.
- You wish your--
- I do. I do.
- Now, this week, the girls
were split into two teams
of burlesque dancers to see
who could earn the most dollars
dancing for tips and hustling
with cherry pie gift
certificates.
Tonight, I've asked them
to come decked out
in their high-class drag.
Are you ready, judges?
- Yes.
- Ready.
- Gentlemen...
start your engines,
and may the best woman win.
Sonique-a-nique-a-nique-a.
Oh, she's making a Sonique boom.
[laughter]
- With the lights goin'
and the music goin',
it was perfect,
so I hope they think I did good,
because I felt like
I did pretty good.
- Yes, ma'am, sell the garment.
Oh, my, this dress is wicked.
Are you a good witch
or are you a bad witch?
- When I head up my runway
and I feel like a diva.
- Almost looks like
toilet paper cozy.
[laughter]
In a couture sort of
toilet paper cozy kind of way.
- [gasps]
Wow, dark lady.
- She will take your man, honey.
- Yes, she will.
- I wanted to do something
simple that I could dress up.
I know I look fierce.
- I'm callin' that Cher 2010.
- Yes.
- Sahara, oh!
Stop in the name of love.
- [laughing]
- I feel great.
I'm sparkling,
the judges are smiling.
- Bob Mackie would be proud.
- I'm just livin', honey.
- Pandora Boxx.
- The shoes match the dress
kind of like the carpet
and the drapes.
- Yes!
- I like that dress because
it's a little bit different,
and I really thought that
it would make me stand out.
- Very L.A.
I came out to L.A.
to be an actress-slash-model.
- Actress-slash-model.
- Jujubee!
Is this a hostile takeover?
[laughter]
- I felt like Eartha Kitt.
I'm servin' fish, honey,
and this ain't trout.
- Jujubee Fabulous!
- Nicole Paige Brooks.
- She looks like Courtney Cox.
- I looked like a real girl.
I looked like a model
on the runway,
which anybody wants me to model
their dress, sign me up.
I'll be more than happy
to do it.
- Yes, mama!
- Mystique Summers Madison.
Girl, your pussy is on fire!
- Oh!
- My outfit for the runway
is a nice, simple kind of
evening gownish,
'cause I'm a gown bitch.
- That girl will eat Beyoncé
in one swallow.
- [laughing]
- And she is telling you,
"I'm not going!"
- Send me Morgan McMichaels
from the secretarial pool.
- I didn't want to wear a gown.
That's boring to me when
everybody else is doing it.
- Oh, executive realness.
- [laughs]
Executive realness.
- Oh, my sweet gherkins!
There's a new Tyra in town.
Tyra Sanchez, the other Tyra.
- I know I looked good today,
because it was elegant,
it was over the top,
and it was still drag.
It gave you everything
you needed.
- I love the nappy pompadour.
- Yes, mama.
Tatianna Von Furstberg
Zeta-Jones!
- [laughing]
- She's giving Galliano
realness, yes.
- The look I'm going for
is Rihanna going to prom,
so I did the little
Rihanna bob with it.
I'm feeling pretty confident.
- Very real.
Ladies, it's time to reveal
which team made the most money
and is safe from elimination.
And the winning team is...
Sahara Davenport's team.
[applause]
Congratulations.
You're all safe.
The winner of this challenge
is...
Sahara Davenport.
[applause]
In addition to immunity
next week,
you've won a $1,500
gift certificate
from sequinqueen.Com.
Thank you, ladies.
Now you may leave the stage.
[applause]
Pandora Boxx, your team is up
for elimination.
What went wrong?
- I think maybe we just
didn't work the crowd enough
or something.
Now, let's talk about
your presentation
on the main stage today.
- I'm not loving
the overall look.
Visually, though, I thought
maybe you could have
pulled the parts together
a little better.
- This dress is not my favorite,
either.
I'm not a fan of the bands.
It kind of looked--
at first, I thought,
what was it, duct tape?
[Santino laughing]
- Thank you, Pandora.
- Thank you.
- Sonique, now, you really
made it rain on the stage,
but you came off
a little bit rude
on the street.
- My time is expensive, too.
- All right, well, then hit it.
- I was rude to, like,
one or two people,
but, I'm sorry,
it was hot out there.
I was in a hurry.
I was trying to raise
as much money as I could.
It was a challenge. You would
do the same thing, right?
- I do sassy,
I don't do bitchy.
Nicole Paige Brooks.
Now what are you serving
on the main stage?
- This was actually just
a backup that I brought,
because the first gown I had
technical difficulties with.
- I thought, more than anyone
when she walked out,
I was like, "Whoa! Is that
a real girl over there?"
And I like your little Megan Fox
tongue thing that you did,
but don't do it too much
like she does,
or else it loses effect.
- You could have looked like
a young Janice Dickenson,
but it came off
kind of like a drunken
Janice Dickenson at times.
- Ha-ha!
Our next lady is Tatianna,
a vision in purple.
How do you feel your hustler
game came through
on the challenge yesterday?
- I think it worked pretty well.
- One thing I really noticed was
one of the guys
asked your name
when you were done.
Nobody asked
anybody else's name.
They were fallin' in love
out there.
I called you Kim Kardashian
on steroids.
- Ooh, yeah.
- But in a good way.
- Yeah.
- In a good way.
Kim wished she looked that good.
- Raven, doin' the solo.
You didn't make
a lot of money there.
- No, I didn't.
When I started seeing
the other girls come back,
I thought, "Fuck,
I fucked this up."
- What would you
have done differently,
knowing how it went?
- I wouldn't have moved as much.
I would have gone
to the edge of the stage,
laid out, and let them
just throw the paper on me.
- Lady ATM.
[Santino laughing]
- You're very femme fatale.
I was a little bit scared.
I would not leave my man
in a room alone with you.
- Don't do it.
I'll work it.
[laughter]
- Morgan McMichaels.
- Yes.
- You have immunity.
- Yes, ma'am.
- You know, in a minute,
I'm gonna have to send
someone home.
Who should it be and why?
- The weakest person in the
group, you know, is Tatianna.
- Tatianna, who do you
think should go home today?
- I'm just gonna go with Morgan,
because she has immunity.
- Tatianna, that's an answer
for the Miss America contest,
not the<i> Rupaul Drag Race</i>
contest.
Nicole, same question.
- Send 'em all home.
- Send all these bitches home?
- Ooh!
- Okay.
Send all these bitches home.
- I mean, they eventually
all have to go,
so, I mean, I don't want
to be the one who goes,
so send 'em all.
- Raven, who would you
send home tonight?
- I would say Tatianna.
I don't think she wants to be,
like, a grand, superstar diva.
I think she's comfortable
being a beautiful girl.
- No.
- [laughing]
- Not the case.
If I was comfortable
being a beautiful girl,
I was a beautiful girl at home.
That's not why I'm here,
to be, like, pretty.
- Okay.
- Thank you.
- Just my opinion.
- All right.
Pandora, who should
I send home tonight?
- I think that the ho that made
the least amount of money
should go home.
But I don't know who that is.
[laughter]
Ladies, while you enjoy
an Absolut cocktail
in the Interior Illusions
lounge,
the judges and I will
deliberate.
Thank you.
[engine starts]
This is the hardest part.
They're all fabulous kids,
but one of them has to go home.
Nicole Paige Brooks brought in
the least amount of dollars,
and Raven was second to last.
Raven seemed like she was
out of her element.
- The performance wasn't
my favorite performance,
but I think today she was
really exciting to watch.
- Had I not talked to her,
she was gonna be my bottom two,
but I like that sense of humor,
I like that little edge.
I'm not ready to see her go yet.
- Right. Now, Tatianna.
She's green.
- When I saw her dancing, I was
like, "She's the prettiest one."
- Do we give her the opportunity
to blossom on this show,
or do we say, "Look, honey,
you got to come prepared."
- She's gorgeous, however,
she didn't know how to make
her disadvantages
her advantages,
and everybody else here does
seem to know how to do that.
- Let's move on to Sonique.
- I definitely sort of sensed
a little, you know,
sort of feminine sweet like,
"I know I was kind of bitchy
to people on the street, but I
won't ever do it again, 'kay?"
- [laughing]
- Pandora was actually one of
the team's top money earners.
- She didn't stand out for me.
- I know you didn't like
her outfit.
- I hated that outfit.
- I equated it to, like, she
just got off the Greyhound bus.
Maybe that worked
to her advantage.
Maybe people like to see that
kind of starving, hungry look.
You know, maybe that's why
she made so much money.
I don't know.
- So she may not give
kind of great ass,
but she gives great sass.
- Yes.
- I just like her
sassy attitude.
- Nicole Paige Brooks.
She got a little lost
in the crowd. Do you agree?
- I do agree.
[imitating steady tone beeping]
That's death
in this competition.
- I kind of like the highs
and the lows.
The kind of bipolar.
To me, that makes life richer.
- Sure.
- And I'm just getting Prozac.
- Silence!
Bring back the girls.
Welcome back, ladies.
Based on your<i> Starrbooty-licious</i>
challenge
and tonight's presentation
on the main stage,
I have made some decisions.
Morgan McMichaels,
you have immunity this week.
You're safe.
- Thank you.
- Sonique, on stage, the crowd
was turned on by your body,
but on the street, people were
turned off by your mouth.
No one wants a cherry pie
that bites back.
You're safe.
Nicole Paige Brooks,
you brought in
the least amount of money.
I'm sorry, my dear,
you're up for elimination.
- I was surprised I was
the lowest earner of tips.
I really thought that my
exuberance on the street
would have pulled me
out of the bottom.
- Pandora Boxx, you're safe.
- Thank you.
- Raven, you were the second
lowest earner,
and in a moment, you'll have
a chance to prove yourself.
You're up for elimination.
- When she told me
I was up for elimination,
my knees locked,
my head got dizzy.
I literally thought
I was gonna pass out.
- Tatianna,
sharpen your claws, baby.
It's a jungle out there.
You're safe.
Two queens stand before me.
I've consulted with the judges,
but the final decision
is mine to make.
This is your last chance
to impress me
and to save yourself
from elimination.
The time has come
for you to lip sync
for your life.
Good luck, and don't fuck it up.
-<i> And now,</i>
<i>it's time for a breakdown.</i>
[laughter]
- Oh, yes!
[cheers and applause]
- I've made my decision.
Raven...
you will live to fly
another day.
Shante, you stay.
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
- Nicole Paige Brooks,
you are a fabulous queen.
I send you home to carry on
the fine tradition
of the Atlanta queens
who have come before you.
Now, Sashay...
away.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
The fact that I even
walked through these doors
is overwhelming to me,
and definitely didn't think
I'd be leaving this soon.
I'm ready to go home
and see my baby.
- Ladies,
you know competition is hard.
Ain't no half-steppin', mama.
You have to bring it.
That's what we're here for.
Now, remember,
if you can't love yourself,
how the hell you gonna
love somebody else?
Can I get an amen?
all: Amen.
- All right.
Let the music play!


-<i> Tonight, on RuPaul's</i>
<i>Drag Race: Reunited!,</i>
<i>the superstars</i>
<i>of season two return,</i>
<i>and the fur flies.</i>
- Some of these girls
in the competition
need a personality lift.
- Fuck you too, bitch.
-<i> Watch as my girls dish</i>
<i>a little bit of love...</i>
- Pray for me
and pray for my son.
- That's the call that I waited
my entire life to hear.
-<i> And a whole lot of shade.</i>
- This woman's gonna cuss me
the [...] out.
[laughing]
- Hey, I'm not done talking yet.
You will speak when I'm done.
- Ooh.
- Security.
-<i> And we announce your choice</i>
<i>for this season's</i>
<i>fabulous Las Vegas</i>
<i>Miss Congeniality Award.</i>
<i>Gentlemen, start your engines.</i>
[car engines racing]
Welcome to<i> RuPaul's Drag Race:</i>
<i>Reunited!</i>
People are always asking,
"RuPaul, what's the secret
to the show's success?"
Well, the answer is simple.
It's magic.
Before your very eyes,
12 supernatural men turn
into bewitching beauties
and do things that mere mortals
can only dream about.
Why, these drag queens
are just plain wicked.
And they got more tricks
than Jesse James
and Tiger Woods combined.
And just as they cast
their spell upon the nation,
one by one--poof, poof--
they vanish.
But tonight, through the magic
of television,
you can thank your lucky stars,
because all our queens
are back--
tucked, plucked,
and ready to conjure up
a little realness.
First up, these two queens came
to<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i>
representing the South.
Can I get a big hallelu for
Miss Shangela Laquifa Wadley,
and from Atlanta, Georgia,
Miss Nicole Paige Brooks.
Next up, Miss Two-Piece
and a Biscuit herself,
Mystique Summers Madison.
The last time these two queens
were together,
they were lip-synching
for their lives.
Please welcome back Sonique
and Morgan McMichaels.
Hello, ladies.
all: Hi.
- [laughs]
All right, girls, let's dish.
- Uh-oh.
- Shangela, was that corn
on your wrist?
- Ooh! Yes!
This is my new Gaga-inspired
"cornsage."
- A-mazing.
- Yes, I've learned a little bit
in the last year.
- Now, you'd been doing drag
for just a few months
before coming to<i> Drag Race.</i>
Do you think you were too green
to be on<i> Drag Race?</i>
- No, I definitely came
to this competition to compete,
to be a drag superstar.
I mean, did you see the
lip-synch for your life? Okay?
I definitely came to party
with the people.
But you guys said that I needed
a little bit more time.
This wasn't RuPaul's school
for girls, all right?
All right!
So I left, learned a little
something,
and then went and won
this California Entertainer
of the Year pageant
and came home with a crown, ow.
- Okay.
[laughing]
So you're snatching trophies
and corn.
- Honey, I'm snatching
everything,
and hopefully a husband is next.
Hallelu.
- Thank you.
All right, Nicole Paige Brooks
from Atlanta, Georgia.
- Yes, sir.
- I know that you are
a fierce drag mama.
Uh, you're also
a fierce drag papa.
- Yes.
- Did your son get
to see the show?
- He saw the Barbie part,
when we did the Barbies,
and he's like,
"Oh, Da-da's on TV."
And he got really excited.
But, um, he hasn't seen Nicole
yet.
But there's pictures of me
all over the house,
and you ask him who that is,
and he's like, "I don't know."
I don't think that it's all come
together yet, but it will.
- How old is he?
- He's four.
- Now, you didn't last as long
as some people predicted.
- Yeah.
- Now, what were
your frustrations
with the competition?
- I really...liked all
the sorority of the girls.
You know, we were pretty unified
when we were here.
And then I was shocked to see
Raven talking about everybody
behind our backs.
To be honest, my feelings--
- Were you really?
- I was really surprised.
- Really?
See, I thought Raven was
very up-front, like me.
- You didn't say nothin'
behind my back.
- No, of course, not, but,
like, I didn't think Raven did
either.
- Well, we will discuss that
when Raven comes out.
- Yeah.
- All right, Mystique.
Now, you said you were bringing
up the plus-size gals.
Did you get a lot of support
from the community?
- Yes, I got a lot of people
saying, "Thank you for showing
me that I can go out there
and just be me and not conform
to, like, society's thoughts."
- Now, some people felt
that you had given up
on the last challenge,
that you had sort
of thrown in the towel.
- There's a lot of issues
with that.
I live in Dallas, Fort Worth.
And a lot of the gangs and stuff
was acting up in Mexico,
and they was kidnapping
Americans.
'Cause my mom works in Mexico.
So that morning, I heard that a
lot of Americans was kidnapped.
So in my head, I was like,
"I don't know
if it's my mom there."
- She's not a drug mule,
is she?
- No, she is not!
- She was okay, right?
- She was okay, be--
- Well, I have to ask, then,
about why the<i> schmatta</i><span style="bodyStyle"> blouse</i>
and the black pants.
- I mean, the black pants,
they were busted.
- But the thing is, I wanted
to be, like, you know,
the up-to-date,
country type of thing.
- Time out! Please.
Real quick.
I'm a native Texan.
And you said I'm representing
the people who really dress
like this in Texas.
This is representative
of how we dress.
That is not representative of
how everyone dresses in Texas.
And your makeup skills are not
how everyone in Texas
does makeup.
- True.
- Well, Mystique, you look
beautiful tonight.
- Thank you.
- You look gorgeous.
All right, Sonique.
- Hi.
- Now, I gotta say,
the elimination
between you and Morgan
was one of the toughest
I've ever done.
'Cause you were both incredible.
- Thank you.
- Did I get it right, though?
- I actually--I don't know.
I thought I was prepared
and everything like that,
and I've learned so much more
about myself
and about my drag
and everything.
But I--I felt like
the whole time I was here,
I was in a dream.
- Was it a sweet dream or
a beautiful nightmare for you?
- My mind was always
somewhere else.
- Like, where else?
What are you talking about?
- I don't really feel
that people got a chance
to get to know who Sonique is.
- And I've heard that there's
something you want to share
with us concerning that.
- I don't know,
I was always just so...
Um...it's very personal,
and I don't want to...
- Can I check on her?
- We'll give her a moment.
- [crying] I know
they don't understand.
And that's--
and that's the reason why
I've been so unhappy
for so long.
- Hey, kiddo, you okay?
What is it, honey?
Talk to me.
- I haven't been happy for
a really long time in my life.
And I've never understood why.
I just had to be honest
with myself and...
I've...
I'm a woman.
I'm not a boy who dresses up.
The--I feel like the only thing
I've ever done right
was go to a doctor
and start transitioning.
I've never been more happier
in my entire life.
- Good.
You want--would you...
join the group again?
- Yeah.
- Maybe we could talk
a little bit about it.
- I'm proud of you.
- Come on, baby.
- Thank you.
I'm so happy.
How's my makeup look?
- Destroyed, bitch.
- Don't do that to me.
- All right, ladies,
Sonique is back.
Do you feel safe to share
something with the group?
- I always knew that there
wasn't something right.
I couldn't ever be boy enough.
I've always been a girl.
I've always been a girl
trapped in a boy's body.
I started doing drag.
And...there was just something
about it that wasn't enough.
And I've--I went to a doctor,
and he put me on testosterone
blockers,
and then moved me to hormones,
and my levels are even,
and I've never been happier
in my whole life.
- Well, I know a lot of people
get it confused--
what a transsexual is and what--
- There's a line between drag
and transgender.
Most transgender girls
do not do drag.
You know, they want to live
their life solely as a woman,
where drag queens want to get
out of drag and be a man.
When I go home, I ne--
I dread taking off my makeup.
- Listen, I'm so happy and proud
of you for being so courageous.
'Cause I know how hard that is.
You know, I--I'm a man,
I do drag,
and that's what I do for work.
But for you to make
this realization,
to be happy performing
but also to clarify
not only for all of us,
but for yourself,
I applaud you.
And I think it's so courageous.
And you have our support, this
family here, forever, any time.
[light applause]
All right.
Moving on
to Miss Morgan McMichaels.
Now, I hear that you are
transitioning from being a man
into a butch man.
Is that right?
- [deep voice] Absolutely.
[all laugh]
We're going in different
directions, Sonique and I.
- Now, Morgan, you and Mystique
had your moments together.
- Did we?
- When?
- When?
- Let's take a look.
- Oh, here we go.
You have no class
and no manners.
- No class, no manners?
You piss me off some more,
I will whoop your fucking ass!
Bitch, I am from Chicago!
[laughs]
- Wow.
Morgan, that was intense.
- You know, at the end
of the day, I'm a man.
And I'm not gonna let people
disrespect me.
Now, everything that I said
during the fight,
obviously it was elevated,
and it was heated.
And, you know,
your makeup is your own,
and your hair is your own,
and everything that you do
to make Mystique is fabulous.
I think you're
an amazing entertainer.
- Why, thank you.
I love you too.
We should make out later.
- Ew.
- [laughs]
See, no, we had a heart-to-heart
since the whole fight.
- Yeah, we've spoken.
- We spoke.
Some people think we don't talk,
and we're just pissed off
at each other.
- People are under the illusion
that one fight has ended
any chance of a friendship.
- Are there any girls that you
haven't kept in touch with?
- I haven't spoken
with Tatianna.
Like, watching the episodes and,
like, watching the comments
she made about me,
I was not surprised.
I think I was more disappointed.
- So you found out more about
what she said
once you watched the show.
- Once I watched the episodes,
and she kept calling me a whore,
and I needed to be knocked off
my high horse,
I think it was
from her own insecurity,
'cause I never said a bad word
about Tatianna.
- Well, you'll have a chance
to speak with Tatianna
face-to-face,
and all the other girls,
when<i> RuPaul's Drag Race:</i>
<i>Reunited!</i><span style="bodyStyle"> continues.</i>
Welcome back to<i> RuPaul's</i>
<i>Drag Race: Reunited!</i>
Our next doll
is a dancin' queen.
Welcome back, Sahara Davenport.
From sizzling San Juan,
it's Miss Jessica Wild.
<i>Escandalo!</i>
When this queen's in the house,
it's a barrel of laughs.
Give it up for Pandora Boxx!
This next queen's natural beauty
is undeniable.
Welcome back the ravishing
Tatianna.
The song you just sashayed out
to is the Bangkok Booty Mix
of<i> LadyBoy,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
available on iTunes.
Sahara, now, during the show,
we found out that your mother
was a minister
and that your family wasn't that
supportive of your drag career.
Since the show, what's happened?
- One night,
I was heading out to a gig,
and I got a text from her:
"I see you on RuPaul's show,
and you look fabulous.
Call me."
And I was like, "Oh, my God,
I'm gonna call her,
and this woman is gonna cuss me
the [...] out."
- You thought
it was an intervention?
- Yeah, I thought
it was an intervention,
but I actually called her
the next morning.
She was like, "Oh, my God,
I'm so proud of you."
- Would you say
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
is bringing families together?
- Christian, black families
together!
- All right, praise--
- Hallelu!
- Hallelu!
[laughter]
- What reaction
do you get from fans
who've watched you on the show?
- I get Facebooks all the time
from little boys who are asking
me questions like,
"I want to tell my mom.
I don't have the strength.
I don't have the courage.
Please help me."
And it's just like,
"I didn't know I was signing up
for that," you know.
I thought I was coming on,
you know, to--
to be fabulous and show
the world my talent and,
you know,
increase my booking fee.
[laughter]
But the show definitely
has given me a voice,
and it's taught me that,
outside of just the performance,
that we all have a voice
and have a responsibility
to not only our community,
but to the world,
to share and help those in need
as much as we can.
- That's lovely,
and you're absolutely right.
Thank you, Sahara.
Now, Jessica, you had some
issues with your English.
- Yes.
I was so scared when you called
me that I'm on the show.
Because I don't speak English.
But I think, at the same time,
"I'm not gonna quit.
I'm just gonna do it."
- Well, I think your accent
is absolutely charming.
- Sometimes I'm lost,
but I'm acting like...
"Oh, oh, yes.
"Oh, my God, the judges?
"Oh, I love it.
I love it."
- What's the wildest thing
people have written to you?
- A mom write me that her son
want to be a drag queen.
And her son have ten years old.
And she said, "Now you show me
that my son is a special,
and I need to love him more
and more."
So I teach people that my mom
love me, no matter what.
So you need to support your
family, because we are specials.
- Yeah.
Thank you, Jessica.
- Thank you.
- Pandora, now,<i> Entertainment</i>
<i>Weekly</i><span style="bodyStyle"> called your elimination</i>
the most controversial.
And at one point in the show,
I called you the Susan Lucci
of<i> Drag Race.</i>
You came very close
to winning challenges,
but you never won a challenge.
Do you hate me?
- I was the one
that keyed your car.
- Oh, it was you!
- Yeah.
I feel much better now.
- Oh, good.
So, Pandora, you made
a very brave admission
at one point in the show.
Let's take a look.
- I tried to kill myself.
- Oh, no, sir.
- I didn't understand.
I didn't know what gay was.
I knew I was totally different,
I felt totally alone.
I thought that, you know,
"Well, I'll just take
all these pills
because I don't--
I can't deal with it anymore."
- Now, that was very brave,
and I was very moved by that.
What's the reaction been?
- I've gotten many emails
from people
saying that they have gone
through the same thing,
and they've felt
the same emotion.
And I actually got, probably,
the most powerful email.
Somebody said,
by hearing my story,
that they said
that I saved their life.
I burst into tears.
I was blown away by that.
- It's amazing the power
that you have as queen,
and it's quite a gift.
I also remember that you talked
about your father,
and that he, you know, wasn't
that accepting of what you do,
and that he had been ill.
- He always accepted me being
gay, but the drag thing,
he just didn't want
to really acknowledge.
- Was there any closure there?
- There was a moment
before he passed away.
It was actually a week
before he passed away.
And he called me and he said
that he watched<i> Drag Race,</i>
and that he was so proud of me,
and he was my number one fan.
And that's the call...
[choking back tears]
That's the call that I waited
my entire life to hear.
- That's beautiful.
And so many have been waiting
for that call.
Do you have anything to say
about the people out there
who have been waiting
for that call?
- I would just say that know
that you're good enough,
and you're perfect
the way that you are.
And you have to affirm
your life,
and that's what I did before,
but it was amazing to at least
have that moment
before he passed away.
- Well, no matter what happens,
I mean,
you always kept us laughing,
and that's worth $1 billion.
- Can I get paid a $1 billion
for it?
[laughter]
- I love that outfit,
by the way.
It's your<i> Drag Race</i>
official dress.
- It is.
You know, I'll just go
into merchandising for it.
- I think it's brilliant.
Yeah.
- By Marco Marco.
Well, I came up
with the concept,
and then he did it for me.
- It's brilliant.
- Changed a few things.
- Yeah, it's great.
- It's got it all: the checkered
flag, the runway--
Brilliant.
I figure if
I couldn't win the race,
I'll at least win the race in
this outfit.
- Yes, absolutely.
And I'm sure Santino will have
a lot to say about that outfit.
- [laughs]
And I'm sure I won't listen
to him again.
[laughter]
- I thank you, Pandora.
- Thank you.
- Tatianna.
- Hey.
- T-A-T-I.
Yeah, you were one controversial
character on the show.
- Evidently.
- During the show,
you were pretty beat up
by the other girls.
- There was a few nights
that I went back to the hotel
and just cried and didn't really
want to talk about it.
'cause I didn't want people
to see
that they were getting to me.
- Did it affect you?
- It definitely affected me.
When I left here, I didn't want
to be around drag queens
for a good minute.
[laughter]
I'll say that right now.
I did not want to.
- Now, in a mini-challenge,
we asked you to throw shade
in front of everyone.
And you kind of froze up.
- Mm-hmm.
- Yet...
[laughs]
You weren't shy about
criticizing others
during your interviews.
- Oh, no.
- Let's take a look.
- Oh, boy. Shall we?
[laughs]
I am so happy
that someone said something
about Morgan's whoreness.
Sonique, she always got
that stank face.
Raven all of a sudden decides
that she to blossom, verbally.
These sparkling 30 years that
she's got behind her,
there's just so much there
that she just can't hold it in.
She's just got to spread it.
- Okay.
- Hey.
- Do you think it's okay to say
something behind somebody's back
as opposed to--to their face?
- I didn't come in with,
like, a strategy of,
"Well, I'm gonna be nice,
and then I'm gonna cut 'em,
you know, behind the scenes."
Like, it wasn't like that.
I wanted to speak of others how
I would want to be spoken about.
When someone comes at me wrong,
then that rule's going out
the window,
and I'm talking some shit.
- When did I ever say or do
anything to you
to make you say something
about me?
Because I never was
that way to you.
- No one said every single thing
that they thought
to that person.
- Well, neither did you.
- No one did.
I know, I know,
and I'm not saying I did either.
- I definitely did.
You're a little more reserved.
I mean, sure, your legs--
you have great stems, honey.
But you know what I'm saying?
But I just didn't appreciate
the fact that, you know,
you totally slung me, like,
"Oh, she's a whore."
- I didn't mean literally
you are a whore.
- Right.
- Certainly not.
- So, Tatianna, the biggest
critique from the other girls
was that they felt you were
getting by on your looks.
Now, how did that make you feel?
- It kind of pissed me off.
- Kind of pissed you off
or really pissed you off?
- It really pissed me off.
- Tell me about it.
- It truly pissed me off.
I'm more than a face.
I have something to say.
I have thoughts.
- You're a great pair of legs
too.
- Thank you.
I think that you saw
that I was progressing,
and that I was growing,
and I feel like all the other
girls chopped it down to,
"Oh, well, she's just pretty.
She's just Rebecca."
And I'm like,
"No, I'm more than that."
Just because I have a more of
a realistic type look sometimes
doesn't mean that I'm any less
of a queen than anyone else.
As long as I have a dick between
my legs and a wig on my head,
I'm a drag queen.
- Dressed.
- Point-blank, period.
And that is the way that it is.
- The criteria gets down
to the charisma,
uniqueness, nerve, and talent.
And you really can't even
compare all of you, you know?
You're all winners.
You're all winners.
Coming up, we'll be joined by
Raven, Jujubee,
and America's Next Drag
Superstar, Tyra Sanchez.
The new Tyra.
Welcome back to<i> RuPaul's</i>
<i>Drag Race: Reunited!</i>
Let's welcome back the Laotian
in the house,
the incomparable Miss Jujubee!
Early in the competition,
this next queen almost sashayed
away, twice.
But she dug deep,
stepped up her game,
and ended up in the top two.
That is so Raven.
This last doll always
stole the show.
And some of these queens
want it back.
America's next drag superstar,
Miss Tyra Sanchez!
[applause]
Tyra!
- Hey.
- My queen.
Mwah. Mwah.
Gorgeous.
- Thank you.
- Have a seat, darling.
You're all here.
How 'bout that?
Look around you.
These are your sisters.
Win or lose, love or hate,
we are family.
[shaky voice]
And I am your mother.
- Oh.
- Mommy.
- Jujubee.
- Hi.
- You talked a little in the
show about being a gay Asian.
Have all the Gasians out there
contacted you?
- Yes.
- What have they said?
- They--they say
that it's an inspiring feat
for me to be on television
and talk about my culture
and actually speak Laotian.
And, you know,
my family's really happy.
I'm very excited.
- Have you talked to your mom?
- I have not.
- Now, if your mom
is watching this,
is there anything
you'd like to say to her?
- Thank you for giving me life.
You know, I mean, that's...
That's really
what I have right now.
It's--it's been ten years, but
I need a little bit--I need--
I need a little bit more time.
- Another ten years?
- No, I wouldn't--I don't know.
I-I feel bad, and I feel
for her, but I'm not ready.
Maybe Jujubee's gonna help bring
that out,
but it's just
a struggle for me still.
- So you didn't become
America's Next Drag Superstar.
- Mm-hmm.
- What is next for you?
- I'm still gonna
keep doing drag.
I mean, I wanna be in movies.
I wanna be onstage.
I wanna--I wanna play Angel
on Broadway in<i> Rent.</i>
I wanna do it all.
- I think that's gonna happen
for you.
The opportunity has opened up
for each of you.
The fact that you made it
into this competition...
eh, uh...
just under 300 years old.
I know some things, and the fact
that this happened--
don't take it for granted,
ladies.
The world is yours, but it
depends on what you put into it.
- I agree.
- Now, Raven, you were
in the bottom two twice.
- Mm-hmm.
- And you ended up number two.
How'd you pull that off?
- I knew when I fucked up.
Like, I knew when I did a bad
job, and I owned up to it.
My chicken was the most horrible
chicken in the fucking world.
Welcome to another...
Oh, shit.
- So your chicken was funky.
- Really funky, girl.
I was so focused on having,
like, a Southern accent...
So then I see that Jessica
was doing a chicken voice,
I'm like,
"I'm such a fucking airhead."
Why wouldn't I do
a chicken voice?
- Now, Raven, you were not shy
during the competition,
and you were liberal
in speaking your mind.
Let's take a look.
- Nicole's gone.
Praise the Lord.
She has acrylic toenails...
with white French tips.
Tatianna's an airhead.
All she's been doing the past
couple weeks is...this.
Tatianna is about face value.
So fuck you, Tatianna.
- Fuck you, too, bitch.
- Mwah.
- Let me put it out there
real quick.
- Tatianna, how do you feel
about hearing all that?
- Um...
I think my feelings
are easily explained.
You're jealous.
You're insecure.
No one that feels that great
about themselves
has to put others down
the way that you do.
I have had very negative
feelings towards you
since the end of that show.
Now, I know that
I said some shit.
But really, though, how do you
say something like what you said
to people--like Nicole.
I think Nicole genuinely
thought she made a friend.
- We were not talking about
Nicole and I right now.
We were talking
about you and me.
- Okay, well,
then let me get back to it.
- But, I mean, that is a fact.
I really did think
I found a friend.
I was gagged by that.
- Until the point--
- Okay--
- I'm not done talking yet.
You will speak when I'm done.
- Ooh.
- Honey.
- Security.
- She has gotten everything that
she wanted to say out about me.
It's my turn.
And I never said anything
hurtful about you.
I said that you run your mouth,
'cause you do.
But I didn't, like--I didn't
go for, "Oh, she's fat.
"Oh, she's an airhead.
"She's dumb, she's nothing.
They're living for someone
that's nothing."
Bullshit.
- When my opinion was asked for,
is when I gave it.
- When you were in an interview?
- When I went into the
interview, they would say,
"What do you think about this?
What do you think about that?"
Here's my opinion.
So if it came off and sounded
shitty,
sorry that it sounded shitty.
- No, you're not.
Don't give empty apologies.
You're not sorry for shit.
- Okay, well, then I'm done.
- 'Cause I haven't heard
from you.
The only thing I've heard from
you was, "You're gorgeous."
And then another message,
"You're gorgeous."
- 'Cause you are gorgeous,
and I've told you that
since day one.
You, out of everyone in this
competition,
has the most beautiful face
in this competition.
- I'm more than a face.
- It's just malicious,
just gay faggotry
that I just was not thinking
we were gonna run into here.
- Well, guess what.
We are making a TV show.
So don't sit here and act like
we were filming an episode
of<i> 7th Heaven.</i>
- I didn't say that.
- It's a fucking drag
competition.
- Yeah, I know, but, I mean,
but they were all smiling
in my face at one point.
- I never smiled in your face,
and I never hung out with you.
So you can sit there and say
that we were cool
and we hung out--we never did.
Every one of you, even Morgan,
can sit here and say,
"You're a fucking bitch."
I don't care.
- That's evident.
It's very evident.
That's the problem.
That is your problem.
Your personality is for shit.
- It's not a problem actually.
- You are the one
that is face value.
Your outside is gorgeous, Raven,
but your insides are dark and
nasty, and I don't like you.
- You were pretty bitchy
yourself, so there.
- I wasn't that bad.
I was not like you.
I wasn't like you.
Let's be clear.
The people I spoke shit about,
I'm sorry, at the point in time,
they deserved it,
and I was mad.
But I didn't deserve
what you said about me.
I didn't deserve it
and neither did anyone else.
- So you going, "Oh, I pity you
for the face you have,"
that's not the same thing?
- There's a difference.
I'm sorry, but there's a
blatant, obvious difference.
- I know Raven really well,
and Raven's a beautiful fucking
person.
I know you really well,
and I know you're a fucking
beautiful person.
You guys have such
the same traits
that it doesn't work.
Do you know what I'm saying?
And I hate--and I hate--
and I hate to say that to you
and to you, because I know you
don't like that,
but there's a lot
of similarities.
So live with it or just don't
talk to each other.
- And I will say,
on my last night--
or my last day there,
I had a conversation with you,
and I said, "You know what,
"we do have things in common.
I don't understand why you hate
me so much."
And it's almost like you look at
me, and you see--
- Well, I don't hate you.
I don't hate you, Tatianna.
- The things that you say,
I can't fathom--
not hating someone,
but then feeling justified
and not wanting to apologize
for the things that you said.
- If it hurt your feelings,
okay, then I am sorry
that it hurt your feelings.
I am not sorry for saying it.
Okay?
- Okay.
- Now, we are overly sensitive.
But your feelings are not facts.
And I said this to the first
season,
because they got their panties
in a bunch
over things that are said.
Listen, kiddo,
things are gonna be said.
And you're all highly
intelligent,
you're all highly sensitive.
You have to not let it
hurt your feelings.
Raven is a little more seasoned.
So her skin is a little bit
thicker, basically.
- It's weathered.
- It's--[laughs]
Raven, you're under a lot
of heat right now,
but you've also made millions
and millions of fans.
Would you have done anything
differently?
- I wouldn't have said a lot of
things that I did or said them
the way that I did.
I realize I don't speak
eloquently.
I'm not a lady.
- Oh, no, I think you speak
very eloquently.
- Well, thank you.
But I--you know, and I have
the mouth of a trucker.
So I'm like--I guess you could
say I'm an eloquent trucker.
[laughter]
I would have worded things
a lot softer.
Because like Pandora said in one
of the<i> Untuckeds,</i>
that the next drag superstar
needs to be
basically not such
a wretched cunt.
- [laughs]
- So I would have worded things
differently.
- Really?
- Yep.
- Now, Tatianna,
Raven apologized,
but you still seem
to be holding onto it.
Why is that?
- 'Cause, you know,
I am sensitive.
And the things that she said
did bother me.
And when I came here I, "A," had
no friends in the drag world.
I had also never traveled
by myself before.
I'd never been on a plane
by myself before.
I had never been
away from my family
as long as I was by myself.
So I think it just--
you think of someone
in your head a certain way,
and when you watch it,
it's completely different,
it kind of--it hurts.
- Yeah.
- And I should not have been as
vocal as I was about Tatianna,
about you, again,
and I'm gonna speak to you.
I apologize.
- So, kids, this is the perfect
time for a little hug.
- For your mother.
- For your mother.
- Aw.
Well, Tatianna, Raven,
I hope you feel better.
I know I do.
Welcome back to<i> RuPaul's</i>
<i>Drag Race: Reunited!</i>
Tyra Sanchez.
- Hi.
- America's Next Drag Superstar.
Now, some people probably think
this is a controversial decision
to have you as
the Next Drag Superstar.
Of all the girls, you received
some of the harshest criticisms
from the other competitors.
Expressions like
"lazy bitch,"
"immature,"
"mannerless."
- "Satan's baby."
- "Satan's baby."
How's that make you feel?
- When I watched it, I realized
that, at the time,
I was all those things that they
were calling me.
All I can do is, like, apologize
to Sahara and to Tatianna,
all the girls, Jujubee, whoever.
If I hurt your feelings,
if I did anything to,
like, make you upset,
like Pandora, or anyone else,
I can only apologize.
I can't take back what I did.
But I can only make
from this day forward better.
- Well, you know, a lot of
people who have written in
have very strong feelings
about you.
You know,
they acknowledge the fact
that you are a fierce queen,
but your behavior on the show
turned them off.
Is there anything you want
to say to them?
- And all I could ask is that
for them to reach out
and pray for me,
pray for me and pray for my son,
like, for us
to have a better life
and to be better people
within ourselves.
- Um, coming back here,
you know,
you get to reconnect with people
you haven't seen in a while,
and I saw a complete change
in Tyra.
She's completely not the--
not the same Tyra
that I fought with.
She's not that Tyra anymore.
- What's changed?
- Just the general demeanor.
It just seems like she's
a lot more like, "Hello."
It looks like she wants
to try and integrate.
I didn't get that on the show.
It would be everyone hanging out
and then Tyra separating herself
to a certain extent.
- I think she was just
so focused on a goal,
and that she didn't want to come
and hang out with everyone
because then she would end up
not being focused
on the next day's challenge
and could possibly end up
in the bottom two.
- Is that true, Tyra?
- Before I came here,
I didn't have a place to stay.
I was sleeping
on my drag mother's floor.
I didn't have a job.
When I came here,
my goal was to win.
If I went home empty-handed,
like, that wasn't an option.
But my mom, like,
she always teached me,
when you want something,
you pray for it.
And so I stayed prayed up.
That's what I call it,
I prayed up.
When I went into the hotel,
I didn't want to hang out.
I stayed in my room and, like,
I would ask God for ideas,
creations for the next
challenge, or what to do on,
like, on the runway.
Give me the idea that I need
to win this challenge.
- She's young.
She have the opportunity
to change, and I think she did.
And I just want to say
that I'm so proud of you.
And I feel great that you are
the Next Drag Superstar,
because you have
a lot of talent.
A lot of people love you,
and we are going to support you
in your career.
- I'm a fan, I really am.
Like, watching the show,
you can't take it from her.
Watching the show I'm like,
"The bitch turned it."
- Well, listen, I think that
your prayers were answered,
and I think that people
will pray for you
and your success as America's
Next Drag Superstar.
I have to say, you came here
with a drag mother
who clearly taught you
the rules of drag.
In the wedding challenge,
you come out on your knees
behind the biggest bouquet
of flowers I've ever seen.
You peekaboo around it,
throw the flowers in the air,
and jump up
without support on your feet.
And when I called you out
after your runway presentation,
you had tears in your eyes.
And you pulled the veil
over your face back
in the back of the room.
Bitch, your pussy was on fire.
That shit was fierce.
Now, I'm--I told you,
I'm just under 300 years old.
Seen a lot of queens.
That kind of behavior
that you had clearly learned
from another elderly queen
such as I,
that's magic.
That's magic shit
right there.
- Thank you.
- Now, Tyra, how do you think
winning the crown will
change your life?
- This is opening so many doors
for me, and not only me,
for my son, just to make
his life better
and to give him the things
that I didn't have.
I actually got custody of him,
so now, this month, he's gonna
be staying with me
from this point on.
And I just, like, have everyone
helping me out in so many ways.
- Tyra, I just have to ask you.
Aside from your beautiful,
bejeweled bosom,
is there a secret
to your smile?
- Yes, I got a new smile,
not because of the reading
that we had.
- Miss Tyra,
was your barbecue canceled?
Your grill is fucked up.
- Oop!
- The barbecue is back, honey.
- The barbecue is back on.
And not because of what people
were saying on the Internet.
I did it for myself.
Got it fixed,
got it straightened.
I even got my voice deepened.
[laughter]
- Can they do that?
- They can do that.
It goes deeper and deeper
every day.
[laughter]
- All right, coming up,
the girls get their chance
to judge the judges
as<i> RuPaul's Drag Race: Reunited!</i>
keeps on keeping on.
Welcome back to<i> RuPaul's</i>
<i>Drag Race: Reunited!</i>
Now, drag queens are always
getting judged.
Every once in a while,
it's nice to give a little back.
So, girls, sharpen your claws
for two of my favorite people
in the world.
Please welcome back our resident
biological woman,
Merle Ginsberg,
and the always fashionable
Santino Rice.
Now, the two of you
are L.A. party people.
Who out there surprised you
that were fans of the show?
- I did a little job
interviewing people
on a red carpet,
and I had to interview Johnny
Weir, the great skater,
and I'm so excited to meet
Johnny Weir.
And I put out my hand, he goes,
"Oh, I love you.
I love<i> Drag Race."</i>
I was like, "I can't even
believe this is happening."
- Now, Merle,
this season on our show,
what stood out fashion-wise?
- Well, Tyra's looks
just blew me away.
They really did.
They were so Paris runway,
Christian Dior.
And I just kept wondering,
how the hell did she do that?
- When you are
in a situation like this
and the whole world is watching,
yeah, you hot glue things
to your body,
you super glue earrings
to your ears.
You see where people's
dedication and passion is
and how bad you want this.
- You chop off those toes
to fit in those shoes.
- Yeah.
- Now, Santino, you saved
your harshest criticism
for Pandora Boxx.
Tell me this, Pandora,
how did it feel
when you were being critiqued
on the runway?
- It was horrible.
It's hard to be up there getting
critiqued, and it did affect me.
And by the wedding challenge,
that's really where I kind
of--I had a breakdown.
I had a breakdown in my room,
because I just went in there and
just cried because I was like,
"I don't know what to do.
"I feel like I'm listening.
"I feel like I'm trying
to do what--
the best I can and to take
everybody's critiques
and do it."
But when you're told that,
"I don't like your style,"
I kind of didn't know
where to go from there.
- All I could say is, Pandora,
do you feel like,
out of all these queens,
you have the best personal style
and you were the most
fashionable every challenge?
- Um, I definitely don't feel
that I was,
but that's not
my strongest suit.
- Sure.
- But, you know,
I can hire a stylist.
And some of these girls
in the competition
needed a personality lift,
and you can't get one of those.
- You're right.
You're absolutely right.
And seeing you today, Pandora,
I think you look amazing.
I think what you're wearing
is funny, it's young.
You look stylish, hip,
but there were times
where you came out,
and it seemed like it was kind
of a rehabbed pageant gown
or something that wasn't quite
up to your personality
and your comedic timing.
- It's about knowing thyself
and presenting that
on the stage,
and you can never go wrong.
- The biggest thing I learned
is not to second-guess myself.
Because every outfit that got
a really harsh critique,
there was another one that I was
gonna wear instead and I said,
"Wear that other one."
and I changed my mind
at the last minute
and just kept what I had on.
So I wish I would have listened
to my inner voice that said
that, you know, "You need to--
You need to wear
the better outfit."
- What do you have to say about
Santino's outfit tonight?
- [laughs]
- I love homeless chic.
I think it looks great.
[laughter]
- You know what, let's all
together, all the contestants,
let out a primal yell directed
towards the judges' panel
over here.
Just yell it out.
One, two, three.
[all yelling]
- [laughs]
Merle, Santino, thank you
so much for coming back.
Now when we return,
the viewers have voted,
and I will announce your choice
for the fabulous
Las Vegas Miss Congeniality
and the final lip-synch
for your life.
So don't fuck it up.
Stay tuned.
Welcome back to<i> RuPaul's</i>

Do whatever you have to do

Now, the fabulous fans
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i>
were asked to vote
for the one queen they felt
was the most congenial,
or as I like to say,
the least shady.
The results are in,
and it was a landslide.
Susan Lucci, the streak is over.
And the winner of the fabulous
Las Vegas Miss Congeniality
prize is...
Pandora Boxx!
[cheers and applause]
Come over here

Ladies, this is it.
The time has come for you
to lip-synch for your lives
to the new remix of my song
<i>Main Event,</i>
available on iTunes.
So don't fuck it up.
Let the music play.
[lively dance music]
Oh, my God!
Hey!


- Previously
on<i> RuPaul's Drag Race...</i>
- I'm getting married, y'all.
- Aw!
- This bitch, she was trying
to annoy everyone around her.
- Ugh!
- Just get yourself some manners
so you won't look
so damn stupid.
- [chuckles]
- Shut the fuck up,
or I'll make you shut up.
- Oh!
- We are all in this together.
Tyra Sanchez, congratulations.
You're the winner
of this challenge.
- Sahara Davenport...
shante, you stay.
- Yes.
- Morgan McMichaels,
sashay away.
[applause]
And tonight...
- Ooh, girl!
[laughs]
- Rock on!
A<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> first.</i>
- I'm gonna shit myself
on stage.
- Yeah, fuck it!
This is great!
- And it ain't gonna be pretty.
- [shrieking]
- With special guest judges
Terri Nunn and Henry Rollins.
The winner of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i>
will receive a lifetime supply
of NYX cosmetics
and be the face
of nyxcosmetics.com,
an exclusive
one-year PR contract
with the leading LGBT firm
Project Publicity,
be featured in L.A. Eyeworks'
legendary designer eyewear
campaign,
and headline
Logo's drag race tour
featuring exceptional
Absolut drinks,
and a cash prize of $25,000.
And may the best woman win.
[electronic pop music]
[alarm clock buzzing]
- Whoo!
One less, girl.
- Wow.
- Oh, Morgan.
- Why did she use
two different reds?
- Because she's deep.
She's colorful and deep.
And her lipstick ran out.
[laughter]
I love you, Morgan.
It sucks that Morgan's gone,
but I feel now that my chances
of being in the bottom two
are a lot less.
While she was here,
I was being too focused
on not only me but her too.
I'm gonna do
what I got to do now.
- I'm still a little shaken
after yesterday's elimination
and being in the bottom two.
I'm nervous.
I don't want to be
in the bottom two again.
- My new nickname.
You want happy ending, honey?
- Not particularly.
[laughter]
- After everything that happened
last night, I feel great.
I don't hold grudges
against anyone,
but I can tell that Tatianna is
sort of holding a grudge.
- Ow!
I don't have any regrets
calling Tyra out.
I hope she took
from the situation
something to work on
in the future,
but that's her deal, not mine.
- Y'all, I was tucked
so fiercely the other day,
I had a blister on you-know-what
and I thought I had an STD.
[laughter]
- Ooh, girl!
You got she-mail.
You want to be
the next drag superstar?
Well, first you better take
a little piece of my heart.
Then you better hit me
with your best shot.
And finally you need
to sing a song
just like a white-winged dove.
So what are you waiting for?
It's time to put another dime
in the jukebox, baby.
Yeah.
- Rock and roll.
They're all titles
of rock and roll songs.
- Yeah.
- Okay.
- Maybe we have to make
a rock and roll costume?
- That's okay.
- Or maybe we have to be
a rock band with all of us.
- Hello, hello, hello.
all: Hi!
- Oh, what do we have there?
- Oh, wow.
- A great drag queen
is like a rock star.
She pushes it to the limit.
But the one thing that remains
her crowning glory is her hair.
For today's mini challenge,
you'll be styling these wigs,
provided by Wig Pro Collections,
into the biggest, baddest
rocker chick hair
this side of Tina Turner.
You'll have 30 minutes
to turn your wig
into a glam rock piece of art.
And the one who really pumps up
the volume will win.
Your challenge...
starts now!
- Ah!
- Y'all some shady bitches.
So shit.
- It's like vultures
fighting over a dead animal
in the middle of the desert.
- Jeez.
- 30 minutes
is not a lot of time
to put in
a really good hairstyle,
so I'm a little worried.
- Where's my teasing comb?
Where's my teasing comb?
I want to win this challenge.
I haven't won anything.
Everybody else has.
- I have no idea what I'm doing
with this hair.
I don't know how to style hair.
I'm not a hair stylist.
So I'm like,
"Shit, what do I do?"
- I'm thinking in my head,
"Think outside the box.
Pandora, think outside the box."
- I look over and I see Pandora
doing hers, and I'm like,
"It looks like Cindy Lou Who
from a Dr. Seuss book."
I'm like,
"What the hell is she doing?"
- All right, ladies.
Time's up.
That's right.
Rocker chicks,
turn your blow dryers off
and put those rat combs down.
All right,
let's start with Tyra.
Sit it right here.
- Anytime I see a video,
I always see 'em with, like,
a mohawk
and it's just, like, real poofy
and, like, puffed out.
I am happy
with how my hair looked.
It kind of reminded me
of Sasha Fierce.
All the other wigs
were a little trashy.
- My inspiration
was a little Joan Jett
but a little Pat Benatar.
- This is actually a nice cut,
but she's kind of
a conservative rocker chick.
It's more sort of a rocker mom.
Wow.
- She just finished a show with
her band, Thundercunt.
And afterwards,
there was a hotel party
and she got completely trashed.
- You might want to get her
into rehab.
- I don't know much
about rock and roll,
but I do enjoy the music
of Pat Benatar.
So I know her hair is short
and kind of powerful,
so I went--chose to go with,
like, a asymmetrical bob
and a little crimping.
- I'm wondering why
you didn't crimp more.
- Well, she's subtle.
- She's a subtle rocker chick.
- Yeah.
- This is Mustang Sally.
- Oh, is this her?
- This is her.
- I've heard of her.
- Yes.
- Pandora's hairstyle
was a mess.
It was like three Halloween
jack-o'-lanterns
stacked on top of each other.
- She has a guitar on her head.
The strings are right here.
- Oh, she sure does.
- Yes, and if you're lucky,
maybe she'll let you play
her head.
- It's like RuPaul does
Cyndi Lauper, doesn't it?
- My inspiration
is the cartoon from the '80s
<i>Jem and the Holograms.</i>
- Oh, yes,
<i>Jem and the Holograms,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> yeah.</i>
- The rock band.
You can use tomorrow this.
- I will definitely consider
using that tomorrow.
- Thanks.
- It's always good
to have a backup.
All right, Jujubee.
She's got so much going on here.
- This is kind of like
the end of the week for her,
and she's getting ready
to go shopping for deli meats,
and she decided
to just put everything on.
- So girl to girl...
- Yeah?
- When did you lose control
of this wig?
- When I got the wig.
- [laughs]
Ladies, you all rocked
this challenge,
but there can only be
one winner, and that queen is...
Pandora Boxx.
Congratulations, Pandora.
You'll find out what you've won
in a moment.
For your main challenge,
you're going
to transform yourselves
into hot rocker chicks.
You can use your own drag,
plus materials provided
by Leg Avenue
and Michael Levine Fabrics.
I expect you to take
your charisma, uniqueness,
nerve, and talent
and amp it up to 11.
But wait.
For this week's challenge, I'm
going to ask you to do something
that I've never asked any of
my girls to do before.
For the first time ever
on<i> RuPaul's Drag Race,</i>
each of you will be singing live
to a heavy metal version
of my song<i> Ladyboy.</i>
- My heart kind of just dropped.
I just don't want to do it.
- To help you prepare
for your singing debut,
you'll be working with one of
my favorite rocker chicks,
whose monster hits include
<i>No More Words</i>
and<i> Take My Breath Away.</i>
Their latest CD is called
<i>All The Way In.</i>
I'm talking about the amazing
Terri Nunn from Berlin.
- I can't believe Terri Nunn's
gonna be coaching.
I can't believe
we're gonna meet Terri Nunn.
Terri fucking Nunn is here.
- Now, Pandora, since you won
the mini challenge,
you get an extra ten minutes
with Terri.
Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best woman win!
Rock on!
- Jessica, have you sung live
before?
- Yeah, I sing before
with the rock band Rebeldia.
I want to be a singer,
a drag singer.
If I don't win this challenge,
then what challenge
I'm going to win?
- Girl, I'm in the same boat
as you.
This is the perfect challenge
for me,
because I've heard every other
bitch in that room sing.
- Ooh, girl!
[laughs]
I can hold a note.
- I have such a big fear of
singing live for an audience.
And I'm really not excited
about it.
I'm gonna shit myself
on stage.
- That's rock.
- The main challenge today
is to make our own
rock and roll outfits.
And we will be performing
RuPaul's<i> Ladyboy</i><span style="bodyStyle"> live.</i>
- I am so excited.
- I'm nervous.
I'm so glad I have immunity.
- Do you know how to sing?
- The other day,
that was my real singing.
I hope the judges don't tell me
to shut the fuck up.
- Does anybody have a pen?
Do you have a pen?
I need to rewrite the lyrics
so that it fits the tempo
that they sing it in,
'cause I can't visualize it
in my head.
This is the challenge
that I'm excited about.
I'm, like, 100% sure
that I'm gonna do fabulously.
I'm very confident about this.
I'm not gonna fuck up.
- Hey, my little runaways.
- Hey, Ru.
- Just checking in.
Looks like the rock shop.
Tyra, tell me about your outfit.
- Because I don't know
too much about rock,
I'm gonna try and go for
a more futuristic rock.
- Have you seen
Tina Turner's videos
or seen her on television?
- The only time
I saw Tina perform
is when she performed
with Beyonce.
- Why did I know
that was the answer?
All right, Tyra,
keep on working.
- Thank you.
- I'm gonna ease on over here
to Miss Raven, who--
something tells me
there is a rocker chick
who lives constantly in you.
- Yes.
- Now, earlier in the run,
you said you don't sing at all.
- No.
- So how are--you feel confident
about doing this challenge?
- Yeah, I do, actually.
Like, I think that when it comes
to rock and roll,
it's about your stage presence.
That's such a good way to say,
"Fuck it."
- That's what rock and roll
is about.
Who do you think is your biggest
competition in this challenge?
- Jujubee.
- Why?
- Jujubee can sing.
She can sing,
and she can sing well.
- Maybe this challenge
is your opportunity
to really step it up.
- Well, I plan on it.
- Rock on.
I'll see you later.
All right.
- Bye.
- Jessica Wild.
- Hi, Ru.
- Look at you.
Are you ready for rock and roll?
- Yeah.
- Do you sing?
- I am not the best singer
of the world.
But I have the personality,
I have the energies,
and I have attitude.
- Yeah. Is this your
rocker chick hair right here?
- Yes, I am going to work
on that wig.
- Because Jessica Wild has
a signature movement,
and it's a hair flip?
- Yes.
- [laughs]
Okay.
Keep working.
- Thank you, Ru.
- Hey, Sahara.
Do you sing at all?
- I do sing,
but I've never done rock before.
- Now, you wound up
in the bottom two twice.
- Girl, don't remind me.
[laughs]
- What are you gonna do
this week to make sure
you don't find yourself
in the bottom two?
- I guess just overcoming myself
and being confident
and letting it out
and not hesitating
or holding back.
My confidence has been an issue
for a lot of my adult life,
and I guess it may be I'm afraid
of disappointing people.
- You ready to rock out?
- I'm ready.
Is that right?
[laughs]
- Tatianna, do you sing at all?
- I used to be in chorus,
but I would even lip-sync that,
'cause there would be
a group of us.
- Really?
- So I just mouthed the words.
- You were lip-synching for your
life in high school chorus?
- Yep, or I'd sing really soft.
- Why?
- Because I was really
made fun of a lot in school,
and so I really thought twice
about everything I did.
I started getting teased
for being gay
when I was in first grade.
I can't count
the amount of times
I was suspended for fighting.
- This is what I do.
And that voice that you're
talking about that says,
"You can't do that,"
that voice will always be there.
Look at me in the eye.
That voice will always be there.
What you have to do--
like muscles,
you have to counteract
that voice with another voice
that says,
"Thank you for sharing.
That was nice, but I'm gonna
do this over here."
This is your opportunity
to put this to the test.
So I want to see you go for it.
- Absolutely.
- All right, Tatianna.
- Thank you.
- Keep working.
- All right.
I think RuPaul
is really looking at me
and wanting to see that I don't
just fall back on my looks.
It definitely makes me want
to make him proud.
- Pandora.
Wow.
Lookit here.
Ooh, that's gonna move
really good.
Have I seen you do this before?
- I don't think
I have done that.
- Do it with me now.
Ow!
- Put it on me, Mister.
- Whoo!
- Whoo!
[laughter]
- I slipped into Cher.
I don't know how.
- Now, throughout
the competition,
we've actually asked Pandora
to push it more.
- I definitely agree, 'cause
I'm not really a singer either,
so I'm really gonna have to go
out of my box,
which was what I was told
in the last challenge,
to think outside the box.
This is very beyond it, so...
- Yeah.
All right, good luck, Pandora.
- Thank you.
- All right.
Jujubee.
- Hi, mama.
- Hi, baby.
- What's going on?
- When I've spoken
with the other girls,
their main concern is you.
- Why?
- Because they say you can sing.
Now, tell me about that.
- I can hold a note.
- What's surprising to me
is that you have not won
a challenge yet.
- I haven't,
and I want to win this one.
- How are you gonna do that?
How you gonna win
this challenge?
- I know that Ru's there
to challenge me,
and it reminded me
of how my father pushed me.
- This is definitely a chance
for you to come out of the
shadow of the other girls.
- My father died when I was 15,
and because he believed in me,
I believe in myself.
I know that's the reason
I perform.
I'm gonna do it.
And I'm gonna make you happy.
I promise, girl.
[squeaks]
- Thank you, Jujubee.
- Thank you, mama.
This is the time
for me to shine,
and I'm gonna knock
everybody's socks off.
- Okay, ladies, in a moment,
you'll get your chance
to work with Terri Nunn.
And tomorrow,
in addition to Terri Nunn,
we'll be joined
on the main stage
by our extra special
guest judge,
the always sexy and outspoken
rocker Henry Rollins.
[cheers and applause]
Yes.
- He's so, um...
manly.
- He's got these huge hands.
I used to have the biggest crush
on him.
- All right, ladies, good luck.
And don't fuck it up.
All right.
- Bye, Ru!
- Hi.
- Hello.
- Terri Nunn is our coach.
She's the lead singer of Berlin.
- I'm Terri.
What's your name?
- I'm Juju.
- Hi, Juju.
- Very nice to meet you.
You're gorgeous.
- Thank you.
So are you.
- It's insane,
and I'm like, "Wow."
- Cool.
Well, let's see the song.
- Okay, let's do it.
Let's do it.
[RuPaul's<i> Ladyboy</i><span style="bodyStyle"> plays]</i>
Ooh, girl.
- Just go!
Just have fun!
- All right.
You got the voice.
Your voice is there.
What's important is,
you need to get these words.
How do you relate to that song?
- It's like me and my girls,
we're going out.
We're gonna rock out, and we're
gonna have a lot of fun.
- 'Cause when you're with
your girls,
you're just like,
"Yeah, fuck it!
This is great!"
You know, you're not thinking;
you're just into it.
- This is probably
the first time in my life
where I'm, like, 100% sure
that I'm gonna do fabulously.
Unless I break my leg tonight,
I'm gonna be fierce.
- Whoo!
- I'm nervous.
- That's okay.
- I can't sing.
- It's okay.
You don't have to be
a great singer.
Just get the feeling across.
- Tyra is very uncomfortable
in this situation
and didn't seem to be able
to get out of that
to just let herself go.
- Okay.
Okay.
This is a performance.
We're not in a recording studio.
I mean, it's not just about
the mic and doing the song.
You're performing.
People are watching you,
and you're here,
so there's got to be
some connection.
Hi.
- Hi.
It is such a pleasure
to meet you. I'm Raven.
- Oh, thank you.
- You're gorgeous.
- Thank you.
So are you.
- I'm a huge fan.
- Well, thank you very much.
Yeah, he's, uh--
I'm kind of just a little bit--
he's kind of cute.
[laughs]
- I want to apologize
ahead of time,
'cause I'm not a singer.
- That's okay.
- At all. That's why I lip-sync.
- Well, you don't have to sing
perfectly.
You just have to feel it
and make us feel it.
- You'll feel it, baby.
- Yeah!
All right!
- Oh!
Whoo-hoo!
Very good!
- She loved me.
- I wish you were straight.
You're really cute.
[laughs]
Tomorrow I'm gonna be up there.
I'm gonna be judging your ass.
- I know.
I'll have it hanging out
for you then.
- [laughs]
Just for you, I'm gonna let it
hang out tomorrow.
- I'm in.
- Thank you.
It was so good to meet you.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Thank you.
- Great job.
- Thank you. Bye.
Bitch.
- Did you love her?
- No, she loved me.
- Oh, really?
- She was like, "You are so hot,
I wish you were not gay."
- Aw!
- Basically,
I blew her out of her seat.
- Well, all right.
Well, all righty, then.
- He's got a presence.
He's got the communication.
- Yeah!
I am nervous.
Maybe my voice is not the best.
But the rock and roll is
attitude, and I have that.
Jessica Wild have that.
I know I'm not gonna be the
best singer in this challenge,
but I don't think
that's what it's about.
I think it's about going for
that rock star attitude.
- I don't know if Pandora
can work on his voice.
That's his biggest weakness.
But I think
his confidence level
will overshadow the fact
that he's not really a singer.
[laughs]
[RuPaul's<i> Ladyboy</i><span style="bodyStyle"> plays]</i>
- I'm nervous, 'cause I'm
definitely not a rocker.
I've done some musical theater.
- I love your softness.
I love your vulnerability.
You've got a good voice.
Right now,
it feels a little like
you don't really know the song
and you're just trying
to get through it.
So just forget about just trying
to get through it.
Just go
with what you're feeling,
even if you mess up the words.
Whatever it feels like
in your body, make it yours.
Am I singing with a track?
Are there words with this part?
- Yeah, that's where
you start to sing.
- The moment that I step
on the stage
to work with Terri, I just have
this sinking feeling.
I can't, no.
- No?
- Mm-mm.
- Okay.
- This ain't working.
- So what happened?
- I just--I'm not comfortable
at all.
- You're not feeling it?
He's in his head.
He needs to get out of his head.
Go sit there.
- Okay.
- Okay?
- I'll do that.
- Now I'm gonna do
what you just did.
I'm just up here,
hoping it's over.
- That's what I'm feeling too.
- I think Tatianna's decided
that she can't sing,
so she's giving up
before she even walks out here.
I just feel
you don't want to be here.
- How was it?
- Don't even ask.
- What did she say?
- It was terrible.
I couldn't even get through it.
- Why?
- I--it's just--I don't know.
- There's two verses
and three choruses.
So learn two verses,
learn a chorus three times,
get over it.
- Maybe tomorrow
when I'm in the whole drag,
it'll come to me
a little bit better.
- I think Tatianna
definitely knows
she's the weakest one here.
- Maybe tomorrow
I can turn it out.
- [rolls tongue]
- Let's rock and roll, bitches.
- How's everyone's nerves?
- I'm nervous.
- They're like, "Just let go."
It's hard to just let go.
They should have had us
bungee jump
before this challenge.
- Isn't it, like,
you'd much rather skydive
than sing live
in front of people?
- And get judged for it?
- They're like,
"Your skydive was horrible."
- Rock and roll, to me,
is just about having
that sense of abandonment
and just going for it
and just rocking out.
That's so the opposite end
of who I am,
because I'm afraid to be messy.
I mean, you guys know me.
I'm not like--
- Rah!
- Right.
I have been messy, and those
were very dark times for me.
The people who I loved
weren't loving me,
and I found solace and comfort
in something else.
When I first came out, there was
some tension between my mother.
I was getting the love
that I needed
from designer drugs
like special K.
I know I'm thankful
for my drag mother
for pulling me aside
and being like,
"Okay, you've become a monster."
- Like, "Calm down."
- "You are doing too much.
This is not who you are."
And it took realizing
that I was in the mess
and that demons can take you
somewhere,
but you don't have to stay
there.
You can come up out
and just move forward.
It's that strength
that got me here.
- Always when I'm going to do
a show, something happen.
- Oh, the zipper's broken.
- When I put my clothes,
boom.
Damn!
My corset explode.
- Hot-glue it.
- Boom, boom, boom, yeah.
- Turn.
- It's open in the back too.
Jessica Wild,
always something happen.
- The closer it gets
to being my turn,
the more
I just don't want to do it.
[laughs]
It's really freaking me out.
[singing scales]
- Everybody thinks
that I'm the one
that's going
to get this challenge,
and I feel great about it,
but if I don't do as great
as they think I am,
it's gonna be an issue.
- [laughs]
[cheers and applause]
- Hey, Santino.
How you doing?
- Hey, Ru.
It's great to be here again.
- I'm so happy you're here.
Merle, darling,
you look very rock and roll.
- Thank you.
- Henry.
- Hey, Ru. How are you?
- Are you ready to take a walk
on the wild side?
- As wild as you'll let me be.
- I'll let you be real wild.
[laughter]
Terri.
- Hi.
- Hi.
You look fantastic.
- Thank you.
You look amazing.
- Thank you.
Now, this week,
we asked our ladies
to transform themselves
into hot rocker chicks...
- Yeah.
- And, in a<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> first,</i>
sing live on the main stage.
Hey, judges, are you ready
to rock and roll?
- Yeah!
- Okay.
- We were born ready, baby.
- Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.
[cheers and applause]
[RuPaul's<i> Ladyboy</i><span style="bodyStyle"> plays]</i>
- Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
[cheers and laughter]
I love to perform
in front of people.
[cheering]
- This is a headbanger's ball.
[cheering]
- Yeah!
This is a huge fear for me.
I know I am not the best singer,
but I don't think
it's about that.
I think
it's about rock and roll.
- Oh, yeah!
- I hope you like a ladyboy.
- Yeah!
- Put your hands together.
- Yeah!
- You do not want
to go home alone.
Put your hands together.
[cheers and applause]
Everybody.
Scream!
[people cheering]
I am definitely channeling
my inner rock goddess,
but I'm a little nervous,
and I fumbled
through some of the words.
- Ow!
It felt good to sing in front
of an audience,
which is odd,
because I was freaking out
about it so much.
Let me hear you say...
- Y'all ready to rock and roll?
[cheering]
[cheering]
I'm feeling, like,
the rocker energy,
like, just the fun, carefree,
fuck-you energy.
You know what, Danny Bonaduce?
You know what, Eddie Murphy?
[cheers and laughter]
You cannot have this ladygirl,
honey.
You cannot afford this ladygirl,
honey.
You better work.
[muttering]
I enjoy the energy
from the crowd.
I was giving my version of rock,
and I thought that I did great.
[cheering]
Right before I get on stage,
I feel wonderful.
And then bam,
I get on stage.
I freeze.
I am screwing up RuPaul's song
right in front of her face,
and it sucks.
- Ladies, that was
the best concert I have been to
in a long time.
It's time to hear
what our judges think.
Let's start with Jessica Wild.
- Jessica, you're a rock star.
You were into it right away.
You knew the words.
Your outfit's amazing.
- Jessica Wild.
- Yes.
- You killed it.
If there was some critique,
the hair, it's a little wiggy.
- You used your hair as a
weapon, which I quite liked.
And also I truly believe that
you connected with the music,
so I thought you were fantastic.
- Thank you.
- Great.
Okay, Jujubee, you're next.
All the girls said
you were the one to watch
because you could sing.
I was surprised that you...
didn't know the words
to the song.
- It's a pretty simple song,
and I didn't learn it,
and I can't take it back.
I feel like a failure.
- Terri, what'd you think
of Jujubee's performance?
- I have to say, you did
need to know the words,
'cause the words for us singers
are the lines.
We got to know our lines,
and there's no excuse for that.
People come and pay money.
- Oh, Jujubee, today you were
off your game.
When you first came out,
I saw your lips moving,
but I couldn't even hear you.
Like, you almost were afraid
to hear your own voice.
- It occurred to me
during your performance
that the music seemed to be
more like incidental soundtrack.
You went in and out
of connecting with the lyric.
- I think everyone is just
a little disappointed.
- I am so devastated,
because not only
did I let the judges down;
I believe my father was there
watching me,
and I let him down.
- Next up, Pandora Boxx.
- You brought it.
You were a punk rocker
out there.
- Thank you.
- Pandora, I think
your outfit looks great.
It wasn't the best performance,
but I could tell that you
put in a lot of effort.
- I liked the aggressive
punk rock energy you brought,
although, for me,
there was moments
where you kind of got
a little happy,
where you started kind of
hopping around like, "Yay!"
I'm like, "No, no!"
When you're gonna go out
with some attitude,
just remember to stay with it.
- Rock on, bitches.
[laughter]
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
- All right, next up,
Sahara Davenport.
Were some of the lyrics
a problem for you?
- Um, no, it was more breathing
and trying to focus
but not be so focused.
- I knew you were nervous.
I knew you were worried
about your voice.
I was like, "Oh, god," you know?
"Maybe she still hasn't
gotten over
being a little afraid of this."
You didn't know the words,
and that is important,
because people notice that.
You know, it's important
to them
that you care about the song,
because usually they're coming
'cause they care
about those songs too.
- You are very elegant
in that dancer, chic,
refined essence.
- But is that rocker chick?
- Well,
that's what I'm wondering.
I know it's probably hard
for you to let go,
because you do have
all that dance--
- Girl, I just did it.
I just let go, baby.
I mean, I don't know what else
you want from me, Merle.
I'm just a girly girl.
- Maybe I just wanted it
a little rougher.
- All right, next up, Tatianna.
- First, you were the biggest
improvement of everybody.
When we finished working
together yesterday,
I was scared for you,
because you were scared.
And you came in,
and you knew the words.
You brought it, and I know
how hard that was for you.
- Being Joey, I felt naked.
But as Tati, I feel like
I can do anything.
- T-a-t-i.
B-o-d-y.
Body, body, body, body.
You're still riding on
this body, and it's amazing.
I just wish you could bring
another element
to this overall look.
Bring it up to rock star level.
- Up next, Rockin' Raven.
Turn around; let's see
what you're working with.
- Oh, my god.
- Rock and roll, baby.
- Raven,
you come out with the ass.
Now I want girls.
You're hot as a girl.
- I've turned you
into a lesbian?
- I'm in.
- Yes!
- Remember at the beginning
of the season,
we were kind of giving you
a hard time about you're cold,
you have too much attitude?
Tonight you took that attitude
and you lit a match under it.
So it was like sneery,
"I'm better than you,"
but it was so perfect
for rock and roll.
- I enjoyed your performance,
because it seemed very much
in the moment.
You sold me completely.
- Thank you.
- Tyra Sanchez,
the other Tyra.
- Instead of doing
kind of hardcore rock,
which everybody else did,
you did glamour.
I think it worked against you.
I felt like you were
more concerned with your look
than your performance.
- I thought the performance was
dominated by your clothing.
It seemed to keep you from
connecting with the music.
I don't think you brought
the rock to it.
- Thank you, for everyone,
for your critiques.
- Thank you.
Ladies, while you're enjoying
an Absolut cocktail
in the interior illusions
lounge,
the judges and I
will deliberate.
Thank you, ladies.
This is not gonna be easy.
- No.
- So let's start
with Jessica Wild.
- I thought she was fantastic.
It was ever changing,
yet she kept me with her
the entire time.
- Today I know
why she's still here.
- It was her conviction,
wasn't it?
- Yeah.
- Now, Pandora,
she did a great job too.
- She was unique in all of them,
because she just had a different
attitude than everybody else,
and it made her stand out.
- She came out, and she was
flipping us off and everything.
That, to me,
was a complete turn-on.
- She performed in a way
that I'd never thought, really,
Pandora could perform.
- Now, Sahara Davenport,
I saw her trying really hard,
but I wasn't convinced.
- I felt like she was playing
at being a rock star,
that she had, you know,
read a book about it
and so she was trying out
the moves.
I wasn't feeling
that she was really into it.
- There were great moments
where she lost her considerable
restraint and let loose,
but it wasn't consistent.
- Now Tatianna.
- I loved her look.
I loved that she tried for
something completely different.
You know, everybody thinks
rock is big hair,
and to me, it's about being
an original.
- It just kind of falls
in the middle for me.
I do wish that, you know,
with her youth
and beauty and body,
she would step it up
a little bit more.
- Now, I was very impressed
with Raven.
- Her look is just--
it's really intense.
I like that kind
of confrontation
that isn't necessarily violent
but it does make you deal,
'cause rock and roll
is about confrontation.
- Raven's guts
always win the day.
I thought it was extremely nervy
that she came out
with Terri Nunn hair
in front of Terri Nunn.
- For me, there were
two rock stars in this group,
and they were Jessica and Raven.
She just has that.
- Tyra.
- Tyra has immunity this week,
and if she didn't,
she would be lip-synching
for her life.
- She just kind of did, like,
a weak Beyonce imitation.
- And her twirling around was--
what are you doing, lady?
I don't care
if you don't like rock music.
Your job was to convince me that
you were rocking,
and she wasn't.
- The girl who shocked us all
was Jujubee.
- I had really big expectations
for her.
She's great.
We've all been wanting her
to win a challenge.
I thought
she could win this one.
- I did too.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I thought that Jujubee
was gonna do really well.
When I saw her walk out here,
it's like watching someone
do karaoke really badly.
- And then she didn't know
the words, and, I mean,
that just comes across
as a performer who doesn't care.
- All right.
Silence!
I've made my decision.
Let's bring the girls back
to the main stage.
Welcome back, ladies.
Based on your rocker chick
challenge,
I've made some decisions.
Tyra Sanchez, fortunately,
you won immunity last week.
So you're safe tonight.
Thank you, Tyra.
Jessica Wild.
Pandora Boxx.
Raven.
As rocker chicks, you ruled.
But one of you
took this challenge
and turned it into
a rock and roll fantasy.
Jessica Wild...
congratulations.
You're the winner
of this challenge.
[applause]
- I am disappointed, because
I haven't won any challenges,
but I've been close
to winning each time.
- You have won
a $1,000 shopping spree.
But Jessica?
You have not won immunity
for next week.
Ladies, moving forward,
there will be no more immunity.
From here on in,
every moment counts.
- Of course I feel a little mad.
I win now,
and I don't have immunity.
- Being told that there's
no more immunity left sucks.
That's just going to show you,
"Look, bitches,
it's getting serious."
- Thank you, Jessica.
- Thank you.
Gracias.
Thanks.
[applause]
- Thank you.
- Pandora Boxx, you are the
Susan Lucci of this competition.
- I am.
[laughter]
- But you're safe.
- Thank you.
- Rockin' Raven, your star
continues to rise...
and you're safe.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
Jujubee,
coming into this challenge,
you were the one to beat.
But you proved to be
your own worst enemy.
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
- Ru is very disappointed in me.
I let her down,
and I let myself down.
- Tatianna, you were lost.
But once again, you channeled
your inner Britney.
You're safe.
- Thank you.
- Sahara Davenport.
I'm sorry, my dear, but you are
up for elimination.
- You know,
before when I was in the bottom,
I was freaking out.
Like I've said
and I'll say it again,
I came here to win,
and I'm not a quitter.
I'm not gonna cry.
I'm gonna fight it out.
- Two queens stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me
and save yourselves
from elimination.
The time has come for you
to lip-sync...
for your life.
Good luck,
and don't fuck it up.
[Alannah Myles'<i> Black Velvet]</i>
- This is my moment.
This is my last chance
to show Ru and the other judges
that I deserve to be here.
- I love Juju,
but I'm ready to take her down.
I want to be
one of the last ones standing,
and I'll do everything
to ensure that I am.
- Right away, you see Sahara
going into pirouettes,
and, girl,
that's not what this song is.
- Sahara's kind of doing
the dancer thing
that she did
in the last elimination,
and I just feel like Jujubee
is really capturing
the essence of the song.
[song ends and applause]
- Ladies, I've made my decision.
Jujubee...
shante, you stay.
- Thank you.
I'm shocked.
Emotions take over me,
and I just can't help
let it all out, you know?
- Sahara Davenport,
it's come to a point
where I must say good-bye
to my best girls.
As you move forward, hold your
head high and stay on your toes.
I know you will.
Now sashay away.
- Thank you all so much.
Thank you.
[applause]
I'm heartbroken
because I didn't win.
I learned so much about myself.
I learned that I got
in my own way sometimes,
but life goes on.
There are big things in store,
so you just watch out.
- Congratulations.
There are six of you left.
I will see you dolls next week.
And remember,
if you can't love yourself,
how in the hell
you gonna love somebody else?
Can I get a "amen" in here?
all: Amen.
- All right.
Let the music play.


- Previously
on<i> RuPaul's Drag Race...</i>
For the first time ever,
each of you will be singing
live.
[feedback whines]
- This ain't working.
- I think Tatianna definitely
knows she's the weakest one.
- Y'all ready to rock and roll?
- [screaming]
- This is a Headbanger's Ball.
- [screams]
- [mumbling words]
<i>I am screwing up RuPaul's song</i>
<i>right in front of her face.</i>
<i>- Two queens stand before me.</i>
<i>Jujubee, Shante, you stay.</i>
Sahara Davenport,
sashay away.
<i>And tonight...</i>
Reading is fundamental.
The library is open.
- Oh, Ru, we have a under-grown
orangutan.
<i>- And the dolls get</i>
<i>a real education...</i>
- If you don't know
what a golden shower is,
that's very naive.
<i>- With extra-special</i>

[alarm beeps]
- Oh.
- Look at this.
- "Live, love, believe.
Sahara."
It's your fault.
That why she is not here.
- How did it feel to finally
lip-synch for your life?
- I don't want to talk
about that.
Oh, my gosh.
The last challenge I...
sucked.
I never want to lip-synch
for my life ever again...
ever.
- You said you used to do
musicals in high school, right?
- I did.
- How were people with you
in high school?
- I was everybody's friend,
really.
I didn't really have...
- Were you out in high school?
- Yeah, totally.
Like, how--how the hell
am I gonna hide that?
[laughs]
- I got picked on
in high school.
They used to throw papers at me
and stuff.
Everyone referred to me
as "that gay boy James."
- In Spanish,
the word are more bad.
[speaking Spanish]
- You want to hear it
in my language?
- What?
- [speaking native language]
Doesn't that sound dirty?
Imagine being called that
by your uncle.
- Yes.
- Wow.
- When I was young, I--
everybody have fun about me,
because I'm gay.
I want to take dance class
before,
and I can't, because I'm scared
that my mom said,
"My son is gay?"
- I tried to kill myself.
- Oh, no, sir.
- I didn't understand.
I didn't know what gay was.
I knew I was totally different.
I felt totally alone.
I hated myself, for,
like, years,
and I thought that, you know,
"Well,
"I'll just take all these pills,
because I don't--
I can't deal with it anymore."
- I was pretty shocked
when Pandora shared
that she attempted suicide,
and she was really, really
depressed.
- But there's still,
once in a while,
that little voice that says,
"Oh, no one likes you,"
or, "You're not good enough."
And it's tough.
I mean, I don't think
it ever goes away.
The adversity that
I've gone through being gay
has made me stronger
and really has made me
who I am today,
and I'm really happy
with who I am.
- Can I get a amen up in here?
- Amen.
[siren wails]
- Ooh, girl,
you've got shemail.
[laughs]
Oh.
Hey, racers.
I want to read you
a little story
called<i> Drag Fun</i>
<i>with Dick and Jane.</i>
"See Dick.
"See Dick try on Jane's pumps.
"Strut, Dick, strut.
"You better work, Dick.
And they lived 'draggily'
ever after."
Now, that's my kind
of fairy tale.
What's your story?
Hello, hello, hello.
- Hello!
- Hi!
- My exceptional girls.
Now, as drag queens,
we shrug off a lot of insults.
So when we get our chance
to throw an insult,
we turn it into a high art form.
We call it reading,
or throwing shade,
and it's part of our culture.
For today's mini-challenge,
you will read
your fellow queens.
The library is open.
- I don't read people.
- Of course you don't, Tyra,
'cause you're Christian.
Come over here, girl.
Here are your reading glasses.
Now, what I want you to do
is go down the line.
I want you to read
these bitches.
Read. Starting with Tati.
- Oh, wow.
We have Eminem doing drag, mama.
- Oh.
- Oh, wow.
And standing right next to her--
is that Dumbo flying in?
Oh, mama.
Is this Jujubee?
Darling,
let me get to your level.
- Oh!
- Oh, Ru, we have
a under-grown orangutan.
- Oh, and next to her--
Darling, how old are you?
And the one on the end?
Oh, just look at her, Ru.
Are you going swimming,
or are you doing drag, mama?
What is that?
- Wonderful.
The library is closed.
Tatianna, come on down, honey.
The library is open.
- Ugh. I don't want to do this.
- Go.
Smile for me.
Don't smile.
Do you pick up satellite
with those big ones?
[suspenseful music]
I can't do this.
- Dig deep, darling.
- I just couldn't think of
anything to say.
That's totally not my scene.
I'm lost. I'm gone.
- Tatianna got up there
and froze.
She runs her mouth about people,
but doesn't talk
when she absolutely has to.
I'm shocked
Tatianna's still here.
- The library is now open.
- You think that is big?
You need to see another thing
that I have for you, bitch.
You are so fat, girl.
[laughter]
What are you doing here, mama?
Go back to Chinatown, girl.
You are a<i> gringa, puerca.</i>
- Oh. Oh.
- You, the top model?
When I see your face,
I said [speaks Spanish].
- La biblioteca is closed.
All right, Jujubee.
- I'm not nervous.
I'll read a bitch.
I will read you to filth.
Miss Tyra,
was your barbecue cancelled?
Your grill is fucked up.
And, Miss Tatianna, Miss honey.
You think you're so soft.
Not by the hairs
of your chinny chin chin.
[laughter]
And let me tell you something,
<i>puerca.</i>
You won't understand this
anyways.
[speaking native language]
Get my gist?
Do ya understand?
Pandora...
Can we talk about sun tanning?
And you!
Legendary, you think you are.
Legendary?
Looks like leg and dairy.
- Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
The library is closed.
Oh.
Okay.
Pandora Boxx.
- Tyra Sanchez,
if you are America's sweetheart,
America needs
a heart transplant.
Tatianna,
all I hear when I put my ear
up to yours is the ocean.
Jessica Wild.
Those drag clothes look like
a donkey funked a piñata
and threw up.
Jujubee,
with that gaping thing
you call an asshole,
I think I could go spelunking
in there.
- [gasps]
Spelunking.
- Raven, the frosty bitch.
I think I see penguins
circling that pole.
- The library is closed.
Ready for the flavor
of the Raven?
- You got a grill that could
put Black &amp; Decker
out of business.
- Ooh!
- Everyone thinks you're pretty.
I do think you're pretty.
I think you have
a beautiful face...
for radio.
- Oh, oh, ooh, ooh.
- You want to call me
a top model,<i> mami?</i>
Bend over and take it
like a man.
I'll be your top...
model.
- Oh, that's cold.
That's cold.
- Honey,
don't you know a thing about
doing a manicure
and a pedicure?
Fix them hooves, honey.
Pandora,
by the looks of you,
you're going through the change
of life, honey.
- Oh, oh, oh.
She done closed the libraries.
Ooh, child.
I need to duck and cover,
'cause y'all bitches is throwing
beaucoup shade.
But the winner is...
Jujubee.
- I win! Finally!
- Congratulations, miss thing.
Now, I wanted to take
this moment
to introduce you to
Absolut image czar
Jeffrey Moran.
- Hey, ladies. How are you?
- Hi.
- To be the best,
you have to be daring enough
to do things
a little differently,
and we've done that recently
with a brand-new flavor
that we're gonna debut here--
Berri Acai.
And what we want from you today
is just that.
We want you to be
a little different,
a little exceptional,
because just like you,
we believe that in
an Absolut world,
every cocktail is
an exceptional experience.
- Now, ladies,
"exceptional"
is the word of the week.
Now, I've had the chance
to write two books
about my own
exceptional life experiences,
including my recent book,
<i>Working It:</i>
<i>RuPaul's Guide to Life,</i>
<i>Liberty,</i>
<i>and The Pursuit of Style.</i>
Writing a book is a great way
to let people know
who you really are.
For this week's main challenge,
you need to come up with
your own book,
an autobiography,
that highlights
the most exceptional moments
in your life.
They should shed light on
who you really are.
Now, later on,
you'll be working with
a team of photographers,
Idris and Tony, to create
the perfect book cover.
And I'll be back a little later
to check on your progress.
Gentlemen,
start your engines.
And may the best woman win.
- Jujubee.
- This is my creative
inspiration, okay?
- That's your thinking cap?
- It's my--
it's my thinking hat.
- Our main challenge today
is to come up with a concept
of what our book would be
and then design the cover
for the book.
- This challenge is so different
from all the other challenges,
because it's about us letting
people know who we are.
- I dedicate my book to Beyoncé.
- [laughs]
- This might be the turning
point for some people.
- Hello, hello, hello.
- Hello.
- How's your autobiography,
Miss Jane Pittman?
Do you have a title
for your book?
-<i> The Woman in Me.</i>
- Is this funny? Serious?
- It's more serious.
It's, like, how the woman,
which is Tyra,
helped me, like, get back to
loving people
and understanding people and
allowing people to love me back.
As a teenager,
I made mistakes.
I was out on the streets.
I had a son on the way.
So it was, like,
a little scary.
And to express it and put it out
has been a little challenging.
- Now, the cover of your book,
any ideas?
- I don't have any yet.
- If you want to be
behind this book,
you have to own it here.
Any questions?
- Nope. None.
- Okay.
Hey, Miss Raven.
- Hello.
- Do you have a title
for your book?
-<i> Young, Broke, and Fabulous.</i>
- [gasps]
I love it.
- My favorite chapter is LTR--
long-term relationship.
The long-term relationship
I found
is the relationship with myself.
- Ooh, you're getting close
to home here.
- Yes, girl.
- Well, I would just advise you
to strategize
who you see buying this book.
[both speaking Spanish]
Now, what's your book about?
- A kid.
He always have dreams,
daydreams,
and at the end,
all those dreams
he make come true.
- Well, you know,
there are a lot of dreamers.
I just want to make sure
that the people know
that this book is about
Jessica Wild.
And a gorgeous picture
on the cover.
A title that's kind of funny
to say or cheeky.
So think about those things,
okay?
- All right.
All right.
I'm very worry
about my own thing.
I'm thinking in Spanish and
writing in English,
and I don't have a lot of time
for work on this.
- Hi, Tatianna.
- Hello.
- Tell me the title
of your book.
- It's called<i> Tati:</i>
<i>From Teen Queen</i>
<i>to Drag Superstar.</i>
- Sounds salacious.
- It's about my life
prior to becoming Tatianna.
I started doing drag
when I was 14.
I came out in fifth grade.
- Well, it's a great story.
And a lot of people need to hear
that story.
How are you gonna convey that
on your book cover?
- I just want me on,
like, a big, huge stage.
I absolutely think people can
learn something from my story.
And I might have a little bit
more experience
than other people
give me credit for.
- All right,
so get back to your makeup,
and make a real pretty cover.
- All right.
- All right.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
Hey, Pandora.
- Hey.
- So what's the title
of your book?
-<i> Out of the Boxx.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
- Hello.
- It's about discovering myself
through dressing up
like somebody else.
- Mm.
- And really kind of finding
your inner strength,
and not listening to that voice
that says
you're not good enough.
There's a couple times that
I had tried to kill myself.
- Oh, honey.
Was there a turning point?
- Through theater
and discovering that,
I kind of felt people
that were like me,
and that's when
I discovered drag,
and I started to come out
of my shell
and be more open
and like myself more.
- So you can honestly say,
"drag saved my life."
- Yes.
- I always think of you
as the funny one,
the Goldie Hawn of the group,
and now it's--
it's interesting.
You tell me the story of
your dark night of the soul.
It adds depth to your character.
- I think that with a
lot of people that are funny
and a lot of comedians, there is
some darkness that's there,
because that's what they use to
combat that, was their humor...
- Sure.
- And their laughter.
- It's such a pleasure
to meet you.
I've read all your books.
[both laughing]
What's the title we have there?
-<i> Memoirs of a Gay-sha:</i>
<i>Jujubee's Journey,</i>
<i>and I'm Still Here.</i>
-<i> Jujubee's Journey,</i>
<i>and I'm Still Here.</i>
- My target audience
for my book is gay Asians.
When you're a gay Asian male,
they don't see you as that.
They see you as a woman who
was born into the wrong body.
That's definitely not me.
It basically starts out
with my childhood,
the discovery
of my homosexuality.
- Wait a minute. Hold up.
- I know, right?
- Your homosexuality?
- I know, girl.
And then I touch on, you know,
like, the loss of my father,
and then my move across America.
- How do you say "fierce"
in Laotian?
- I would just say Juju.
- Juju.
[laughter]
- Juju, huh?
- All right, ladies.
For your main challenge,
in addition to
your book cover photo shoot,
you'll be doing an interview
with celebrity journalist
Marc Malkin.
This is a really great time for
you to show off your charisma,
uniqueness, nerve,
and talent.
You'll also be judged
on your ability
to seamlessly work in plugs
for your upcoming book,
as well as
the Berri Acai Absolut cocktail.
The more you can plug your book
and the Berri Acai,
the better.
Now, tomorrow on the main stage,
our special guest judges will be
two best- selling authors--
Gigi Levangie Grazer...
and the one and only
Jackie Collins.
Lucky, lucky, lucky bitches.
- Jackie Collins.
Are you serious?
She embodies what a diva is.
- And to quote
one of my favorite authors...
Don't fuck it up.
- The main challenge today
is to take photos
for the cover
of our autobiography
and do an interview.
- How you doing?
I'm Idris.
- Tyra.
- Nice to meet you.
- Tony.
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- What would you like to do
today?
- Well, the title of my book
is<i> The Woman in Me.</i>
- They're in charge.
They're supposed to direct us
and tell us their vision.
- It's not just about a dress,
you know,
or how the girl looks.
they've got to commit
to their concept.
- The concept is three pictures
of me--
me holding on to the past,
accepting the present,
and looking towards the future.
I don't know how the other girls
are at photos,
but I'm very photogenic.
- You're melting
under these lights.
- It was burning hot.
All my makeup
started sweating off.
I was like, "Oh, shit."
-<i> 30 seconds.</i>
- Tyra's just--
she was melting.
If she were doing a workout book
where you had to be sweaty,
then, yeah,
it would be great.
- I was thinking of taking
the chest that's over there...
- Okay.
- And having me
coming out of it.
- All right.
So let's get the stuff.
- I want my book cover
to be funny,
and my concept is to have myself
coming out of a box.
Lust over me, bitches.
<i>- Okay.</i>
- All right,
so what are we doing?
- One here, one here.
- Just think about your time.
- If you guys want to,
like, face away,
and then just kind of glancing
over at me like, "Damn."
- Okay.
- Now, how do you want them
looking at you,
'cause right now they're kind of
looking at you
like you're crazy.
- No, like you want me.
[laughter]
I can't look at the pit crew
and direct them,
because I'm supposed to be
looking at the camera.
And they weren't
very cooperative.
So finally I was just, like,
"Get the hell away from me."
- Hello.
- Okay, I want to be sitting
at a yard sale,
and I want to sit
in that pink chair.
I knew my idea
for my book cover.
I'm at a yard sale.
I've got to find the shit
and get it together.
I want the award,
the radio,
the bust, and then this phone
right here.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- What's the idea
for the book cover?
- I just want to look good.
- Whatever you want.
- Let's try to work
this shit out.
- Okay.
- That's mannish, isn't it?
- You look a little wide.
- Ooh.
- Jujubee could have used her
time more wisely.
She had extra minutes.
- You know, she came
out with one prop,
a fan in her hand,
and half the time,
that fan was on the floor.
What are you thinking about
right now?
- About my dreams.
- It kind of looks like you're
just standing there staring off,
so you really have to think
about all of your dreams
and let that come out.
[camera shutter clicking]
Honey, why don't you think about
something else,
'cause it looks a little...
- All right.
Oh, my God.
I love doing things perfect.
And I think I lost things
from my hands,
you know?
- What were your other ideas?
- What?
- You wanted to use
some other props?
- She kind of came in defeated.
- And if you come in defeated,
then you are defeated.
Think about something that would
pertain to your dreams.
- Can I take it?
- Yeah, of course.
You can take anything you want
from here.
- Nice. There you go.
Believe in it.
- I believe.
- What is this?
This thing is caught
onto my dress,
and I can't take my dress off.
They have to stop my time.
Immediately after photo shoot,
you have less than five minutes
to change
and get to the interview.
Jessica.
- What?
- Is it okay if I put on your
corset really quick?
- Yeah.
- Now I have more pressure.
Now I have a bigger challenge
to know that I only have
such and such amount of time,
and I need to get this done.
- There was a lot that went into
this challenge.
Tatianna didn't change
her costume at all.
She went straight from her
photo shoot to her interview.
I didn't really see an effort
in that.
- We need to talk about the book
or about drag life?
- The book and the alcohol
is the main focus.
The two really important things
during the interview
is that we have to pitch
the book
and the Berri Acai
Absolut vodka.
- How do you say
that berry drink?
"Acia"?
Berri Ac--
- It's acai.
- Acai.
- Acai.
- Acai.
- Acai?
A-ca-I.
- Guys, is it "Berri Acai,"
or "acai berry"?
- We're going to have
an interview
with celebrity reporter
Marc Malkin,
and as I sit down in the seat
and there's just a camera
in front of me
and they start to put
the earpiece in,
I realize
this is a satellite interview.
He's not going to be here.
- Oh, my god.
There's nobody here?
And he can see me.
But I can't see him.
- Hi, Raven.
- Hi.
Where's the guy at?
- What's going on?
- Is this via satellite?
- It is satellite.
Why should you win<i> </i>
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race?</i>
- Well, first of all, I'm young,
broke, and fabulous.
My new book
is going to hit stores soon.
- What's this new book?
- It's called<i> Young, Broke,</i>
<i>and Fabulous.</i>
- I have the full package.
I have personality,
I have sense of style,
and I have great, big,
white teeth.
- Why are you better
than the other girls?
- I'm better because I'm
Jessica Wild, and I'm unique.
- Now, with all these
drag queens living toge--
- Oh, I love that Absolut acai.
Oh, my God.
- So how many times have
straight men hit on you?
- Every time I've gone out
in drag,
I've gotten hit on
by a straight guy.
Sometimes I'll be like,
"Back it up.
I'm a dude."
If they're just
giving a compliment,
I just say, "Thank you."
So I must be doing something
right.
- It's so exciting to be a part
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
It's almost as exciting as
my new book,<i> Out of the Boxx.</i>
- The book is called
<i>The Woman in Me.</i>
I know how to love,
know how to give, and celebrate,
like I am with this berry
...drink from Absolut.
- I just got finished
writing a memoir,
and I call it<i> </i>
<i>Memoirs of a Gay-sha.</i>
- Where do you hide your candy?
- There's a lot of candy going
on down here.
It's not true what they say
about Asians, honey.
- Every once in a while,
I'll have a cocktail.
My drink of choice
is the Berri Acai from Absolut.
- Do you always drink
when you're doing media?
- No, it's my first time,
but I love that drink.
- What kind of vodka is it?
- Berri Acai vodka.
- Berry Absolut.
- Berri Acai.
- Tatianna,
thank you for being here.
- Thank you.
And let me tell you
about this beverage.
- Oh, good luck. Got to go.
- The only thing
I might have screwed up on
is not mentioning the book.
But everything else, I felt like
I was--I was on point.
- Jessica,
thanks for being here.
- Thanks,
and I have my new book.
- What was that?
- The name is<i> Jessica Wild:</i>
<i>The Dreams of a Golden Child.</i>
- Fantastic.
Thanks, Jessica.
Good luck.
- I love that drink.
- Hola, hola.
- How your hooves be, Juju?
- How's the leg and dairy?
- Yesterday we had to read
each other.
I actually like
all of the queens that are here,
and to read them,
you kind of have to
make fun of them.
- I'm sure everyone's
had a little inkling
of their feelings hurt.
If anyone was offended,
I'm sorry
that I spoke the truth.
- I wasn't offended.
If you can't laugh at yourself,
then go home.
- It's hard to talk shit
about flawlessness.
[laughs]
- Since Morgan's been gone,
Raven all of a sudden decides
that she wants to blossom
verbally.
- Tatianna, did you just
not want to do it?
- No, I just couldn't
stop laughing.
These sparkling 30 years
that she's got behind her,
there's just so much there
that she just can't hold it in.
She's just got to spread it.
- Like, Tatianna froze
and didn't read anyone really.
Do you think they're gonna
look at her and be like,
"What's going on, girl?"
- Raven might have been trying
to rattle my cage.
I think that she's been hoping
that I go from day one.
I did well.
I didn't drop my book.
I got the drink in.
I just completely forgot
about the book.
-<i> Tatianna's an airhead.</i>
She should have been in
the bottom two last week.
All she's been doing
the past couple weeks is this.
Just my opinion.
- Thank you.
And what?
- Hello, judges.
- Hey, Ru.
- Hey.
- Santino, how are you tonight?
- We're gonna have a great show.
- We are.
- Now, Merle,
are you ready to hear from
our budding authors?
- I'm very, very excited.
- Gigi.
- Hi, Ru.
- Hi, darling.
Now, your most recent novel,
<i>Queen Takes King,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
maybe after tonight
you can write a sequel.
-<i> Queen Takes Queen?</i>
- Yeah.
- Okay. Co-write it.
- Done. Done and done.
And my buddy Jackie Collins
is here.
Hi, darling.
- Hi, darling.
- I love the title
of your new book,<i> </i>
<i>Poor Little Bitch Girl.</i>
That's great!
- I should have dedicated it
to you.
- You should have.
And Absolut's image czar,
the exceptional
Jeffrey Moran.
- Hello, darling.
- All right.
Inspired by my new book,
<i>Working It:</i>
<i>RuPaul's Guide to Life,</i>
<i>Liberty, and the Pursuit</i>
<i>of Style,</i>
this week,
the ladies were challenged
to pitch us their autobiography,
design a book cover,
and field questions
from an entertainment reporter.
Tonight they're dressed
to the nines
for their book launch party.
Judges, are you ready
to take a look?
- Ready.
- Ready.
- Gentlemen,
start your engines.
And may the best woman win.
Tyra Sanchez,
the other Tyra.
<i>- The dress that I chose</i>
<i>is very skin-tight.</i>
<i>You can actually see the shape</i>
<i>of my body.</i>
- Is Jennifer Lopez
missing something?
- She is missing something,
and she'll never get it back.
[laughter]
<i>- I know the judges</i>
<i>look forward to me</i>
transforming my look.
- Oh, yes.
Style proper, Sanchez.
[cheers and applause]
Oh!
- No, she didn't.
- Poor little bitch girl.
- I'm glad my boyfriend's
not here.
I would have just lost him
on that one.
[laughter]
- Jujubee.
Now, Gigi,
is this a starter wife?
- That's the finisher wife.
<i>I don't think anyone</i>
<i>would ever leave that.</i>
<i>- I always make eye contact</i>
with every single judge.
It's, like, the complete
opposite of shade.
It's the "hey, hey, hey" look.
<i>- Oh, yes.</i>
<i>Tatianna.</i>
Ooh, it's a jailbreak.
- [gasps]
<i>You know, they say never wear</i>
<i>horizontal stripes</i>
<i>unless you're Tatianna.</i>
<i>- I'm not really super</i>
glammed-out
<i>like the other girls,</i>
<i>but I'm thinking</i>
<i>I look really good.</i>
-<i> Pandora Boxx.</i>
<i>[gasps]</i>
<i>Oh, darling, yes.</i>
She's full of surprises.
-<i> I'm going down the runway,</i>
<i>and I'm thinking glamour.</i>
<i>but, you know,</i>
<i>there's still that element</i>
<i>of fun.</i>
- If Courtney Love looked
like a woman...
- Yes.
Yes, yes, yes.
[laughter]
-<i> Jessica Wild.</i>
-<i> Now, she looks like a heroine</i>
<i>from one of my books.</i>
- Which one, Jackie?
- Lucky Santangelo.
-<i> Jessica Santangelo.</i>
-<i> Today is my party.</i>
<i>I love that dress.</i>
- Jessica Wild
from Puerto Rico.
<i>Raven.</i>
Oh, darling.
<i>That's so not Raven.</i>
[laughter]
<i>- I decided to go with</i>
something
<i>a little more super glam.</i>
<i>I feel like I should be</i>
<i>in Greek mythology,</i>
<i>and they should write a story</i>
<i>about me.</i>
<i>- A star is born again.</i>
- She has a politician lover
on the side.
-<i> Disco scandalous.</i>
Hello, ladies.
My<i> Valley of the Dolls.</i>
<i>Tyra Sanchez,</i>
let's take a look
at your book cover.
Oh, okay.
What's it about?
- My past.
How I held on to it for so long
and held grudges against people.
I was a very, very mean,
arrogant bitch, that--
- And the problem
with that is...?
Let's take a look
at your satellite interview,
where we asked you to promote
not only your book and yourself,
but also the Absolut
Berri Acai cocktail.
- I know how to love,
I know how to give,
and celebrate,
like I am with this berry...
drink from Absolut.
- You didn't incorporate
the "acai" part of it.
- I'd rather not fuck up
the last ending of the name.
- If you're gonna be paid
by a corporation,
you should probably figure out
how to say the name.
- I'm not thrilled
with the cover of the book.
- I felt it was a little busy.
but I love the concept.
I was very happy to see that
you took it so seriously.
- Jujubee, let's take a look
at your book cover.
-<i> Memoirs of a Gay-sha:</i>
<i>Jujubee's Journey,</i>
<i>I'm Still Here.</i>
[laughter]
I just want to show people
that you can go through things,
take that negative energy,
turn it around,
and use it to live.
It's a lesson.
- Love the title.
I'm very big on titles.
My new book is called
<i>Poor Little Bitch Girl,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> so...</i>
But that is a great title,
and I think you'll attract
not only a gay audience
with that title,
but with a straight audience
who's interested in reading
about your life's experiences,
especially coming from
an Asian family.
- It reminds us
of a great book already,
so that was very clever
thinking.
- There's a lot of candy
going on down here.
It's not true what they say
about Asians, honey.
- By the way, I know a number
of big Hollywood moguls
who would like to, uh,
take you out, if you ever--
if you're ever available.
- Tatianna, you're giving this
not jailbreak,
but jailbait look.
Let's take a look
at your book cover.
- Ooh.
- Superstar.
- My book is about
becoming a drag queen at 14,
dealing with the backlash
from that,
but still going forward
and not letting anyone stop me.
- Now, where was that person
when you walked down the runway?
I'm a little worried about
your confidence level.
- This dress, it could be
three stripes shorter.
- Shorter.
- Yeah.
- Okay.
I'm giving up
on trying to figure out
what's short enough
and what's long enough,
because...
- It's just slightly too long,
and it's starting to kind of
give a more
Morticia Addams look to it.
- Straight men love
to hit on me.
Every time I've gone out
in drag,
I've gotten hit on
by a straight guy,
so I must be doing
something right.
- Tatianna,
thank you for being here.
- Thank you.
And let me tell you
about this beverage.
- Unfortunately,
you did not mention
the name of the book.
Maybe it's fortunate,
because I'm not crazy about
the title of the book,
<i>Tati.</i>
Because Tati, I mean,
can be T-A-T-T-Y.
That's an English word
that means kind of not great.
- If that's the way
you squeeze in the cocktail,
we might have had a fight
in the car
on the way
to the next interview.
- Thanks, Tatianna.
- Thank you.
- Hello, Pandora.
- Hello, RuPaul.
- Oh, boy.
You got to use the pit crew.
- My book is about
how drag taught me
to gain self-confidence.
- Pandora, if you're wearing
this to be glamorous,
it's not working for me.
- This fabric is playing
with glamour,
but playing with, like,
funny glamour.
- If you're gonna look like
a coke whore,
take the joke even further.
- What kind of vodka is it?
- It's Berri Acai vodka.
- Missing my brand,
that was tough for me.
- Pandora Boxx, what do you
have to say for yourself?
- I just want to say that
my book,<i> </i>
<i>Out of the Boxx:</i>
<i>How Drag Saved My Life,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
is now available online
and in stores.
[laughter]
- Jessica Wild,
can we see your book?
Oh, wow.
Look at that.
- The cover looks like
the cover of a book,
like, a nine-year-old girl
would buy.
It could be a little more
sophisticated.
- Now, with all these
drag queens living toge--
- Oh, I love that Absolut acai.
Oh, my God.
The name is<i> Jessica wild...</i>
<i>The Dreams of a Golden Child.</i>
- Your interview got into,
like, train-wreck territory.
- On there, it sounded like
"dreams of a golden shower."
Do you know what that is?
- No.
- If you don't know
what a golden shower is,
that's very naive.
[laughter]
However, I like the cover.
It's a little pretentious to
have an Oscar on the front of it
because-- [laughs]
Who knows?
- I'm not crazy about the cover
I feel like you could use
some of that Jessica Wild
imagination,
make a bigger splash
with that cover.
The interview
was basically so bad
that I wouldn't change a thing.
[laughter]
- Now, Jeffrey, you got your
product in there a lot.
- Yeah.
It was a little too sloppy.
I would probably have fired you
in the car
on the way home
from that interview.
- Raven, darling,
I love your fro.
- It was straight earlier,
but it's so humid back there.
[laughter]
- Let's see your book.
Oh.
- I've come from so many
broken things--
broken family, broken home,
broken relationships.
This is showing how to find
your inner strength.
- Why should you win
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race?</i>
- Well, first of all,
I'm young, broke, and fabulous.
<i>Young, Broke, and Fabulous.</i>
<i>Young, Broke, and Fabulous.</i>
- Well, I am extremely
impressed.
Do you know how many times
you said the title?
Even I have trouble--
I do do it sometimes,
but that was really great.
And you did it with style.
You bought it right in right at
the beginning of the interview.
I loved that.
Good for you.
- You're so sultry.
I feel like you could teach me
how to be more of a woman.
- I think you could teach me
how to be more of a woman.
- I don't think s--
[laughs]
- I'm a man in a dress.
[laughter]
- Thank you, ladies.
While you enjoy
an Absolut cocktail
in the Interior Illusions
Lounge,
the judges and I
will deliberate.
[engine turns]
Let's start with Tyra Sanchez.
- I like the title of her book.
[deep voice]<i> </i>
<i>The Woman in Me.</i>
[laughter]
- One of the best dresses
we've seen this season.
And I like the book, and I like
that she revealed a little bit,
'cause we don't see a lot
of vulnerability in her.
- Uh, Jujubee.
- I thought she was dynamite.
He had a fantastic personality.
She came across as really alive
and bright--
very, very bright.
I liked her a lot.
- I think she probably crossed
over the good-taste line,
but we could have probably
lived with that.
- Tatianna.
- It did look like
she was part of a chain gang.
I'm sorry, I couldn't get over
the dress.
It just went on and on and on
and I thought it was hideous.
It looked like Olive Oyl.
- I didn't get--
pick up any confidence
from her whatsoever.
- Pandora Boxx.
You know,
she's been consistent
in her ability
to just be a real player.
But she doesn't take it
to that next level.
- She looks like a girl
that's just stepped off
the Greyhound bus
and quickly
turned into a coke whore.
- That sounds like a book
I'd read...
[laughter]
And Jackie's written it.
- Yes.
Yes, I've written it.
- Jessica Wild.
- Title of her book
wasn't right.
- I mean, she was hilarious,
but not on purpose.
But this is kind of
a serious thing
and it's like, you really have
to step up to the plate
or the dance floor,
as it were.
- This is branding.
Clearly,
Jessica did not understand
the intricacies of that.
Raven.
- She showed this great
personality.
and, uh, the hair was fantastic,
the dress, the book--
<i>Young, Broke and Fabulous.</i>
Not young, not broke,
but fabulous.
[laughter]
- There's a lack of
vulnerability, though, in--
in Raven.
- And there is such a thing
as overselling, you know?
She needs to practice
some restraint.
- All right, then.
Silence.
Bring back the girls.
I have made my decision.
Welcome back, ladies.
You are all my heroes.
And you know that I know
what it took
for each of you
to get here tonight.
So no matter what happens,
you are champions.
Tyra Sanchez,
the next drag superstar
needs to be
consistently dynamic.
You're safe.
- Thank you.
- Jujubee,
you had us at "gay-sha ."
You're safe.
- Thank you.
- Tatianna,
you're young and talented...
but you fumbled your interview.
And you came to the main stage
dressed like a referee.
- I'm sorry, my dear.
you are up for elimination.
- When I find out
that I'm in the bottom two,
my mouth goes completely dry.
I'm not ready to go home.
- Pandora Boxx.
The judges were not
absolutely impressed.
You're safe.
- Thank you.
- Raven.
What can I say?
You're young, broke,
and fabulous,
and you are the winner
of this week's challenge.
Congratulations, Raven.
You've won a glamorous
shopping spree
at the legendary house
of L.A. Eyeworks.
- I finally won
a fucking challenge.
And it was a big win to me.
Thank you.
- Jessica, you went wild
in your interview,
but your cover did not snatch
any trophies from the judges.
I'm sorry, my dear.
you are up for elimination.
- I need to win this,
because I don't think
that I did a bad job
for going back home today.
- Two queens stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me
and save yourself
from elimination.
The time has come
to lip-synch
for your life.
Good luck,
and don't fuck it up.
[Sister Sledge's<i> </i>
<i>He's the Greatest Dancer]</i>
- I'm watching them perform,
and I see Jessica's doing
a little bit too much for me.
- This is my last chance.
I have to win
the lip synch for my life.
- Tatianna starts
doing her thing,
just being very sensual
and sexy,
and it was amazing.
[laughter]
- Great job.
[applause]
- Ladies,
I've made my decision.
Tatianna...
Shante, you stay.
- I was in pure shock.
I thought I might have misheard.
- Are you playing with me?
- Thank you, Tatianna.
You may join the other girls.
- Thank you.
Thank you so much.
- Jessica,
follow your wildest dreams,
my golden child.
Now sashay away.
- Thank you from the bottom
of my heart.
[applause]
I'm very proud of myself.
Be here is one of my dreams.
I make my dreams come true.
I'm a winner.
<i>Amo a Puerto Rico.</i>
- And to my five
remaining queens,
remember,
if you can't love yourself,
how in the hell you gonna love
somebody else?
Can I get a whoop-whoop?
- all: Whoop-whoop.
[laughter]
- Let the music play.


<i>- Previously on</i>
RuPaul's Drag Race...
<i>This week you'll be doing your</i>
<i>best celebrity impersonations.</i>
- I do a really good Pink.
Rock and roll, baby.
- I like playing
hide the cucumber.
- [laughs]
- The only thing Beyoncé's done
funny is fall.
- I almost just jumped
out this chair at your ass.
- Tatianna, congratulations,
you're the winner
of this challenge.
- Thank you so much.
- Morgan, Sonique,
you're up for elimination.
- Your lip-synch was one of
the tightest we've ever seen.
Sonique, sashay away.
<i>And tonight...</i>
I expect a "dragstravaganza."
<i>The dolls go</i>
<i>from blushing brides...</i>
- I'm getting married, y'all.
- To dragzillas.
[record scratches]
- Tyra's a complete bitch.
- Shut the fuck up,
or I'll make you shut up.
- Oh!
<i>- With extra-special</i>
<i>guest judges</i>
<i>fashion photographer</i>
<i>Mathu Andersen</i>
<i>and club diva Martha Wash.</i>
<i>The winner of</i>
RuPaul's Drag Race
<i>will receive a lifetime supply</i>
<i>of NYX Cosmetics</i>
<i>and be the face</i>
<i>of nyxcosmetics.com,</i>
<i>an exclusive</i>
<i>one-year P.R. contract</i>
<i>with the leading LGBT firm</i>
<i>Project Publicity,</i>
<i>be featured in L.A. Eyeworks'</i>
<i>legendary designer eyewear</i>
<i>campaign,</i>
<i>and headline Logo's</i>
<i>Drag Race Tour</i>
<i>featuring exceptional</i>
<i>Absolut drinks,</i>
<i>and a cash prize of $25,000.</i>
And may the best woman win!
[alarm beeps]
- Meow.
Oh, Sonique.
- Sonique was one of the new
friends that I really enjoyed.
It was tough
going up against her.
But at the end of the day,
this is a competition,
and I'm out for blood.
- Who's gonna take it off?
- I will.
- Oh.
- It'll be satisfying.
I am happy that Sonique's gone.
She just always had
a negative comment.
- So do it.
Clean my mirror.
[laughter]
- I won, and she got sent home.
So I really just wanted
to take in the moment
and feel satisfied
wiping her message away.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
- You should be proud
of yourself.
- A lot of people
don't believe in Tatianna,
and she proved to everybody
that you don't know anything
here.
[alarm sounds]
- Ooh, girl!
You got shemail.
Hey, dolls, to prove to me
that you're the next
drag superstar,
you're gonna need to make
a real commitment--
one that could last a lifetime,
or at least until the next
best thing comes along.
Pull yourself together
and you could
have your cake and eat it too.
'cause when it comes
to<i> RuPaul's Drag Race,</i>
honey, we've only just begun.
Ohh!
Hello, hello, hello.
- Hello.
all: Hi!
- Congratulations
for making it this far.
It's getting fierce up in here.
For today's mini-challenge,
we're gonna have ourselves
a little wrap party.
Now, each week
on the main stage,
you turn out one dazzling outfit
after another.
I want you to apply that same
creative genius
to these plain white boxes.
To "queenify" your box,
you need to use
the gift wrap we've provided
plus pieces from your own drag
wardrobe
and something that belongs to
one of your fellow queens.
You have 30 minutes
to complete this challenge.
And when I return, I'll decide
who has the prettiest box.
I'll see you in a few, okay.
- Juju?
- Yes, honey?
- Can I borrow your bird?
- Yeah.
I decide that I want this box
to just be a golden box.
Tyra looks over and she makes
a little comment and she's like,
"Oh, she's using the same
wrapping paper."
- The other queens
are copying my style
because the critique I get from
the judges is usually good.
Maybe I'm inspiring them.
Like, maybe they want to
be like me.
- Hey, Juju, think I could use
a piece of your jewelry?
- Go ahead, baby.
- Thank you.
- Can I borrow
some of your glitter?
- Go ahead, girl.
- Don't sprinkle
all my glitter around
like you did with the shoe,
though.
- All right, ladies.
Time's up.
Ladies, I'm here
to inspect your boxes.
Can I hold your box?
The card on it says, "To Ru,
from America's sweetheart,
Tyra."
I love it.
- I chose the pink
because offstage
I'm a little more delicate,
a little feminine.
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.
- Really?
- Yeah, girl.
- Wow, there's a lot going on
here, Morgan.
- Yes, there is.
It's, you know, loud and fuzzy
and furry and colorful.
- Edgar Allan Poe
would be so proud of you.
- It's dark and sparkly
like RuPaul.
- [laughing]
Pandora Boxx.
- I like the pink and the blue.
It kind of says, "He?
Her?
I don't know what she is."
- Uh-huh, uh-huh.
Jessica Wild.
- Yes.
- Ooh, she's got a hot package,
all right.
So who is this a picture of?
- This is Gladys, my mom.
- Oh, really?
Oh, this is your mother?
- Yes, she is my gift
and my heart at the same time.
- Did you borrow something
from someone else?
- I took her scent,
and I sprayed the box.
- So you have the only
scented box?
- Of course.
- Oh.
- The colors are signature Tati.
I borrowed a stone from Juju.
Thank you.
And it has different dimensions
'cause there's different sides
to me.
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.
- All right.
All right, ladies,
I've inspected your boxes.
But I need to pick just one.
[suspenseful music]
- Caw-caw, caw-caw.
- What?
- Caw-caw.
- Who?
- Caw-caw.
- This box is dark-sided.
[laughter]
I choose this one.
I want this one.
I'm going to embrace
my dark side, Raven.
Raven, you are the winner
of this challenge.
And now for the good part.
You may open your boxes.
Go ahead, open them up.
So far I've asked you to wrap
your boxes
using something old,
something new,
something borrowed,
and now this envelope.
Something blue.
- "RuPaul cordially invites you
to the wedding
of David and Raven.
Ceremony to take place tomorrow,
main stage."
- That's right, you are invited
to your very own wedding.
Yes, my dears, you'll be both
the bride and the groom.
In addition to customizing your
own fabulous,
dragged-out wedding dress,
you will pull together
your best male drag
using tuxedos provided
by Selix Formalwear.
Later, you'll pose
for a wedding portrait
courtesy of Polite in Public,
which we'll show
on the main stage.
And here come
the wedding dresses.
Wow, look at that.
So, Raven, since you won the
mini-challenge,
you get first dibs
from all these wonderful
wedding dresses,
courtesy of RK Bridal.
Plus you get to choose the order
that the other girls
choose their dresses.
- Remember who helped you win,
baby.
- Remember that Raven hat,
darling.
Have you been married before?
- Never.
- Are you sure
that's the one you want?
Okay, who gets to choose next?
- I'm thinking it's me.
'Cause I'm like, girl,
I helped this bitch win. Mm.
- I'm gonna go with Morgan.
- All right.
- I'm sure everyone knew,
she's gonna pick Morgan first.
And I did.
So what?
Get over it.
Boo-hoo.
- I'm like, girl, that was
a mistake on your part.
- All right, Raven,
who goes next?
- Juju.
- Oh, my god, I'm so excited.
- [laughing]
- I'm getting married, y'all.
- Sahara.
Mrs. Wild.
- All these names
were being called.
I'm like, I'm gonna be last.
Obviously, I'm gonna be last.
Raven is jealous of anyone
that has talent.
- Ms. Sanchez.
- Ha ha!
- I like a challenge,
so I'm gonna go with
the ugly one.
- Pandy bear.
- And that leaves Tatianna.
Ladies, do you promise to have
charisma, uniqueness, nerve,
and talent
till death do you part?
all: I do.
- Then so be it.
I expect a "dragstravaganza."
Help yourself
to the fixin's bar.
Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best woman win!
[shrieks] Oh, dear!
[rock music]
- Tyra pushes
the wedding dress cart
in front of the fabric cart.
- Dear!
- Girl, you are so damn shady.
- Ah.
- Tyra pushed the rolling rack
in front of
the rest of the girls.
So Tatianna
pushed the rolling rack
on top of the girls.
- Ow.
- Miss honey,
that's dangerous, darling.
- Cutthroat queens.
Not so cute.
- Get out of my mirror, bitch.
- Sorry.
- The challenge basically is
marrying yourself--
bringing the feminine
and the masculine qualities
together
to make one amazing wedding.
- Tatianna?
- Yeah?
- You were chosen last.
I don't think it was personal,
though.
I should have been chosen first,
though.
- First?
- 'Cause I helped her win that
fucking challenge,
don't you think?
- In all honesty, yeah.
- But it's okay.
No hard feelings, diva.
It's all right. It's all right.
Every time Raven
gets to choose something
and every time Morgan gets to
choose something,
it's, "I pick Raven.
I pick Morgan."
Like, I'm surprised we don't
have a name for them yet.
Rorgan.
Maven.
Hey, Morvens.
- Is it corseted in?
- Douche bags.
- [belches]
Our wedding day.
- I think that the competition
is threatened by us.
I'm sure that
they're looking at us like,
"These bitches
might do a thing or two."
- Raven and I
are helping each other,
but we're still
gunning for the same prize
and we'll do whatever it takes
to win it.
- It's so funny no one
chose the dress that I wanted.
- Which dress?
- The one I got.
I got the ugliest dress,
and my first thing I did
was to go and cut it,
make it shorter.
And then less than,
like, 30 minutes later,
everyone is cutting
their dresses.
Sahara's dress
looks the same way,
and then Jessica's dress
looks the same way
and Morgan dress seems to be
going the same way also.
And it's just like, "Oh, my god,
you guys, be creative.
Be your own selves.
Be unique."
- Hello, brides.
all: Hey, Ru!
- Just checking in.
Now, you know, every bride
wants to look her best
on her wedding day,
so I brought in a pro.
Makeup artist extraordinaire
Mathu Andersen.
Say hi to Mathu.
- Oh, thank you. Thank you.
- Mathu has worked on some of
the biggest divas in the world
like Beyoncé Knowles,
Janet Jackson,
and of course, me.
He's here today to give you
some valuable makeup tips.
Listen and learn, ladies.
Tyra Sanchez.
Mathu here is gonna give you
some tips.
- I don't have a lot of notes
for you.
With a face like yours--
so beautiful.
It'd be so easy to take you to
completely unclockable.
I just want it to look
a little moister.
A little dewiness
just along the highlights.
Some of the other girls do it.
- I think it's because
the other girls' face get oily.
My face doesn't get oily
in drag.
- I do have oily skin.
I'm 30 years old
and I still look fuckin' 22.
'Cause I have oily fuckin' skin.
- Hello, darling.
- Wow. Look it here.
- You know what you're doing.
You know the shapes
you're going for.
The whole thing just needs to be
finessed and smoothed out.
And it is--sometimes it gets
a little bit magic marker.
I recommend always building
all your contouring
into the base.
- This challenge
is gonna be tough,
because I have a point to prove.
That point is I don't deserve to
be in the bottom two again.
- Hey, Pandora.
- Hey.
- Wow. Look at this.
I barely recognize this.
- Yeah, you said
you didn't want "off the rack,"
so I'm going way off the rack.
- Smart girl.
- You're super cute.
I think you could be
really beautiful.
Think Goldie Hawn, really.
Like--'cause see, she has, like,
a simple eye.
Lashy, softer, bigger
and really plump,
'cause you've got great eyes.
Play with that.
- Hi, Jessica.
Wow. Look at this.
- My wedding is going to be
an extravaganza.
- I love an extravaganza.
- Sometimes your face
worries me.
This is a problem.
Your highlights are so bright
here and here and here
that it looks as though
you have stubble.
Maybe it's about
putting the dark under
and then highlighting the jaw,
and really, there needs to be
a lot more blending.
- All right.
- Hi, Sahara.
- Hi, Ru.
- So tell me about your dress.
- I'm gonna cut it up
and make it shorter
and add some volume
to the bottom.
- Now that will go underneath?
- Yes.
- And you have enough fabric
here to support that?
- Uh, yes.
- And you're gonna pad?
- And I'm gonna pad, yeah.
- You've got
a lot of work to do.
- I do. I do.
- Yeah.
- You're so young in person.
- Ooh.
- She's a little old-looking.
Looking at your face now
and it doesn't have
the closed-in thing
that Sahara gets.
This thing always scares me
and this--
- How do I fix that?
- Try a little--something
that's just a little brighter
along there.
- All right.
- Thank you.
- Well, hello, Tati.
- Hello.
- Your makeup's
all over the shop.
It's all over the place,
and sometimes it's beautiful
and sometimes it's like,
"What the hell is she doing?"
But you're so beautiful,
and you don't have to be
overly draggy.
And there's girls
who have made a career
on being that beautiful.
Just depends on what kind of
girl you want to be.
But don't rest on those laurels.
- No, definitely not.
- Thank you, Tatianna.
- Thank you.
- Juju.
- Hi, Ru.
- Wow.
I see jewels for Juju.
What do you call this color?
- Tawny sunset.
- Tawny sunset.
I love that.
- I'd like to see Jujubee's
version of natural makeup.
I use the Mariah Carey
reference.
And I don't want it
to be natural,
but I want to believe
that it's natural.
I want supernatural.
- Okay.
- That's your challenge.
- I will do it.
- Raven.
- Hello, hello.
- You won the mini challenge,
so you got to pick
your dress first.
- Yes.
- Are you happy with it?
- Yeah, I took
the whole thing up.
I started up here by pinning it
and hand sewing.
- So let's talk makeup.
- I would like
to see you introduce
a smidgen of color
into your makeup.
I can see that it's like, "Oh,
this person really knows their
way around their face."
But you could warm this up and
same with your jawline contour.
- Okay.
- Ladies!
Mathu and I will see you
tomorrow on the main stage.
And our extra-special
guest judge
will be one of
my musical heroes...
the legendary Martha Wash.
[applause]
- I'm so excited about
Martha Wash being a guest judge.
I have listened
to her music forever,
and I love her voice.
- Don't fuck it up.
See ya.
Come on, Mathu.
- Today we're shooting
our male half of the photo,
our groom side.
And then tomorrow
we're taking the bride.
We're gonna meld them together.
I'm excited to see
how it's going to look.
- There is slight anxiousness
because I'm not
the most masculine guy.
I never grow a beard.
I don't grow a mustache.
- You know, growing up,
I would sit there on the counter
and watch my mom do her makeup.
You know, I didn't really
watch my dad shave.
I was more interested in
the lipstick and eye shadow.
- You know, doing drag on top
of being gay, you know, at 14,
it was kind of an escape.
Like, I get to be someone else.
I get to be as feminine as I
want to be and then I don't get
pointed out for it...
um, or made fun of for it,
because a lot of people, you
know, didn't know I was a boy.
So this is gonna be just
completely different.
- When I did my makeup as a guy,
I knew I was the first one
in the mirror,
and so I went ahead
and I drew the facial hair on.
Then I look over and then
Sahara's drawing on
the facial hair,
then Pandora's drawing on
the facial hair
and Tatianna comes
and draws on the facial hair.
And it was pissing me off
because this is my hard work and
you're, like, stealing my idea.
So I'm hoping I go on the stage
first tomorrow.
That way, everyone that comes
behind me will look like,
"Oh, I got that from Tyra."
- Hello.
- Hi.
- Morgan.
- My name is Joe.
Nice to meet you.
- It's a pleasure.
- So we're gonna be creating an
illusion here today.
- Story of my life.
- Just imagine that there's
another person next to you.
Look right here.
One, two, three.
Yeah, big motion.
Yeah, that's great.
- My groom is a punk rocker.
He just probably
rolled out of bed
and threw on a leather jacket
and a tie
and came to the chapel.
- One, two, three.
- I do feel comfortable having
to perform as a male, but I have
a little more confidence when
I'm in drag.
I feel a lot more glamorous,
a lot more pretty.
- There's been such a focus on
the girl, the girl, the girl,
that when it was time to be a
boy, I was so stressed that I
was like, "Oh, my god,
it's time to be a boy."
So I had to just push that aside
for a second
and consider the direction
that I want to go.
- One, two, three.
[chuckles] Excellent.
Nice.
- I am smiling in my picture
because if I have
the opportunity
of being married
with Jessica Wild,
I am going to be happy.
- Two, three.
Excellent.
Very nice.
Perfect.
Let's do one just for fun.
Two, three.
Excellent.
What inspired your choice
in outfit?
- Well, he is a police officer.
- A little smile.
- I'm really feeling
like a drag king.
Like, I'm not feeling
like a guy.
I'm feeling like I am a girl
dressing up like a guy.
- And you're gonna look
right here.
Two, three.
[chuckles] Excellent.
- How does everybody feel
about marriage?
Who's getting married?
Who's not?
- I'm not getting married.
- Why?
- 'Cause I'm a bitter bitch.
- Well, with that attitude,
girl.
- I wanna marry my husband.
- You wanna marry your husband?
[laughing]
- I call him my husband.
I am in a relationship,
I do have a boyfriend.
I would love to marry him
one day.
Gay marriage is a human right.
It's our right to be equal.
It's not a, you know, luxury
to have gay marriage.
It's a need and it's a right.
But I tell you this much,
though...
gay people not being allowed
to marry,
to me, is a kick in the ass.
- Do you think Tyra singing
could be, you know, deemed--
- Huh?
- Huh?
- Huh?
- I'm saying
do you think your singing
could be deemed
attempted murder?
- I'm offended.
[singing indistinctly, off-key]
- I totally wanna get married.
- [continues singing]
- If you had a gay wedding,
do you think your family
would be supportive?
- There's the religion thing.
- They're Christian?
- Yeah, my mom's a minister.
I don't know, because she seems
to be more accepting,
and you know, loving.
I think she'd come.
This is who I am,
and this is the way
I'm going to live my life.
And I've come to terms with it.
And my mom doesn't quite
understand it
but is working towards accepting
and, I guess,
loving that part of me as well.
- Would your family
come to your wedding, Tatianna?
- Oh, I don't know.
[chuckling]
I really, honestly,
wouldn't even--
[continues singing indistinctly]
- This bitch...
is pissing me off.
I'm just in my own world.
Honestly, I wasn't paying
attention
to any of the other girls.
- It was really loud.
It was sounding really
obnoxious.
She was trying to annoy
everyone around her.
She really is singing that song
over and over again,
just to get to
me, this fucking bitch.
- [singing off-key]
- She's so self-absorbed.
She's rude.
- I finally was just, like,
I've had enough.
- Shut the fuck up!
I told her, "No one wants to
hear your mouth.
Why are you such a bitch?"
- I put the earphones back in,
and I went back to singing.
She didn't ask politely.
And I just went on,
continued my dress
and continued to do
what I needed to do
to win the competition.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- I think Tyra is a complete
and utter bitch.
Everyone's getting sick of her.
She has way too much
of a diva attitude.
It's not cute.
- So what do you guys think
is gonna happen today?
- Um, I don't know
what's gonna happen today.
- What would you like to happen?
- I would like to happen
what everyone wants to happen.
- I want that bitch to go home.
- Why don't you go ahead and
just speak your mind, my dear?
- I'm just annoyed
with people's attitudes.
- I guess it really shows
how people really are, you know?
- Exactly.
- And I don't feel as though
the next drag superstar
is going to be a little bitch.
- Don't talk about me
like I'm not in the room.
Say it to me.
- All I can say is...
whatever, pig.
- [laughing]
- Yesterday
we did the groom photo,
and today we're doing
the bride photo.
- I don't feel anything today.
This is not my regular makeup.
- Yeah.
- I'm scared.
- Santino is going to
rip in half...Sahara.
I think that Sahara will be
lip-synching for her life.
- I think Sahara's dress
is a little funny.
But she's going for
a<i> Swan Lake</i><span style="bodyStyle"> look,</i>
so that's working in her favor.
And she's going to be<i> en pointe,</i>
which is a tough call.
And hopefully
it pays off for her.
- No, I'm going to walk down the
runway...
like a fairy princess.
- Tyra needs all this help,
and she's just being ignored.
- Oh, fuck this shit, man.
- I haven't seen her help me
with anything.
I haven't seen her help
anybody else with anything.
- Ah!
- Stupid bitch.
Do you know sometimes
when you meet people,
and you think
they're great people
until they open
their fucking mouths?
Keep burning yourself, bitch.
If she screams one more time
with that hot glue,
I'm gonna just,
like, pull my eyes out.
I mean, why would you hot glue
things to your fucking skin?
- Ah!
[Mendelssohn's<i> Wedding March]</i>
- [laughing]
Hey, guys.
Well, hello, Santino.
- How you doing, Ru?
- Merle,
you look lovely tonight.
- Hoping that I actually
could be the bride.
- [laughing]
- Now, Mathu...
- I love your hair.
- You do?
- I do.
- [laughing]
- It's divine.
- And Martha Wash.
I'm so happy you're here.
- I'm glad to be here too.
And you look fabulous, darling.
- Thank you.
This week, the ladies
were creating their vision
of the perfect bride and groom.
Are you ready
to see how they did?
all: Uh-huh.
- Gentlemen...
start your engines.
And may the best woman win!
Sahara, wow.
- Hold me closer, tiny dancer.
-<i> Swan Lake.</i>
- I've dreamed about having
a<i> Swan Lake</i><span style="bodyStyle"> wedding</i>
ever since I was young.
- Married in a tutu.
- It's tutu much.
- Morgan McMichaels.
<i>November Rain.</i>
She's serving a little
Pam Anderson there too.
- I start off like I'm bridal,
and then I start
throwing some sass into it,
and you know,
it's supermodel-esque.
- I'd like to sit on her
loveseat.
- That's the Lacroix--
- Lacroix, the pouf.
Absolutely.
- More cushion for the pushin'.
- Tyra Sanchez, the other Tyra.
Oh!
- I feel great.
My dress looks amazing.
- It's daddy's little girl.
He's paying for everything.
Raven!
She's been hitched, look!
- My dress looked amazing.
I felt like a cupcake.
I felt very cute.
- Look at that nice little line
of bow detail.
- Paris gets married.
- It is very Paris, isn't it?
Paris Hilton.
Jessica Wild...
- My darling,
you do take a hint or two.
- She did your makeup.
- Makeup's a lot better.
- It's my wedding.
And the makeup
helped me with the total look.
- Look at our daughter!
Our little girl's all grown up.
Tatianna.
Look at that keyhole
by her no-no hole.
- I liked my dress; then
I hated it at the same time.
But I was still proud of myself
that I did something with it.
- She's a voluptuous bride.
The implants took.
- Yes, they did.
Pandora Boxx,
oh, wow, look at that.
- Very romantic.
- I wanted to come across
as a very pretty bride
that's very excited
to get married,
and just very demure.
- Very innocent eyes.
- Oh, she did the thing
with the makeup too!
- I'm well pleased.
Like a gorgeous endive salad,
crisp and delicious.
- [gasps]
Is this our Jujubee?
- The gown fits very nicely.
- I want them to see the full
package,
so I'm going to go slowly.
And I'm going to be
very elegant.
And I want you to see
every single angle.
- Look at the back.
Oh, that's beautiful.
- Now instead of
a pearl necklace,
she went for the pearl
down the back.
Oh, yes.
Hello, my blushing brides.
It's time to unveil
your wedding portraits.
Jujubee.
Oh.
What a cute couple.
- I hope you didn't sign
that prenup.
- Honey, he's rich.
- In the picture,
she's not really into the groom.
But I think somehow it works.
- Even though
there's a man in that picture,
it's still sort of
all about her.
- She's a man-eater.
- [laughing]
Thank you, Jujubee.
- Thank you.
- Jessica Wild.
Oh, my goodness!
You've got yourself a hot one,
honey.
- They really
make a cute couple.
- They really are cute.
- The dress I like
except for the piece on the top.
- She's wearing her veil
on her shoulder.
- I could see that you love to
go for the big
and the layers and the ruffles,
but I want it to go away.
I just want to see you.
- Pandora Boxx.
You seem a little tentative.
- I'm scared
of my first marriage.
It was either the option of
going to jail
or getting married.
- Oh, I see.
- Just doesn't do anything
for me.
- Really?
- No.
Marriage, going to jail.
Maybe I'd do the time
for a while.
- [laughs]
- There's a lot of backstory
that I can read
into this picture.
Adds a lot of comedy to it.
- I'm kind of having an organza
orgasm over this dress.
- Oh, really cool.
- I love organza.
- Can we get a napkin over here?
- [laughs]
- Tyra Sanchez, the other Tyra.
Is that R. Kelly?
And she looks like Donna Summer
in that picture right there.
- You look like a porcelain doll
with the makeup.
- Thank you.
- I love it.
- Huge bouquet, Tyra.
- The huge bouquet is because
it comes from
my last husband's funeral.
- Oh, okay.
- I love how big
your bouquet is.
I love the whole shape
and silhouette of your dress.
You were this close
to being bridezilla,
but you are perfection.
- What blows me away is that
you added this little...lace?
- I hot-glued it to my leg
along with these to my arm.
- You're gonna have to
take a flame torch
to get that off of
there.
- You're like an old-school
drag queen,
but fresh and new to us.
- Thank you.
- Hi, Tatianna.
- Hello.
- Ooh. He's hot.
He's gorgeous.
Thug love, baby.
- You're really fortunate
to have immunity this week
because I hate this dress.
- The face is so killer that
you want the clothes
to live up to it.
- Mathu, is this a "xana-do"
or a "xana-don't"?
- It's a xana-don't.
- Sahara Davenport.
- I remember being a little boy
who dreams
of a fairy-tale wedding,
like<i> Swan Lake</i>
or something very ethereal.
- I thought the presentation
was fabulous.
I loved it.
Dress I'm not so sure about.
- When you're not<i> en pointe,</i>
it's not a good look.
It looks a little crafty
and homemade,
and the fit is off.
- Raven.
Oh, how cute.
He looks older than--
- He's 36.
- He's 36 and you're 16?
- Going on 16.
- Ooh!
- Oh, I see.
- [laughing]
- What--okay,
then you're jailbait.
- She's jailbait.
- She's jailbait.
- She's jailbait.
- Love that.
Love your turquoise accents,
love the bows.
You have the most expensive
looking dress up here.
- It's kind of like this fluffy,
girly, flirty dress,
but she's still packing a wallop
somewhere.
- It's under the skirt.
- Yes!
[all laugh]
- Morgan McMichaels.
She's a punk dude.
- I'm not sure
about the punk look.
- It's neither here nor there
for me.
I'm not crazy for it.
- It's more of a costume versus
a wedding gown.
I'm just not loving the shape
overall.
- You know, white pumps
are the sign of a true hooker.
And I love you for that.
Tonight's gonna be more
difficult than I thought.
And I need your help.
What are the judges not seeing
on the main stage
that we need to know?
Tatianna?
- Um, I don't think
that you're seeing
that Tyra's a complete bitch.
- That was frank.
- Thank you.
She has this diva attitude,
like I am America's sweetheart.
But she's not.
- I completely agree
with what Tatianna says.
I don't think that the face
that you see of Tyra
is what we're seeing backstage.
Everyone asked Tyra to be quiet
and not sing obnoxiously loud
for an hour.
- I asked her to stop nicely.
And she was like, "okay."
And then I walk across the room,
and it's like lah, lah,
lah-ah-ah-ah.
- She was almost saying,
"Shut the fuck up,
or I'll make you shut up."
It, like, really,
really pissed me off,
'cause she talks so much shit
about so many people
but won't say it to their face.
- You really
shouldn't play the victim.
It doesn't suit you.
You don't do it well.
- I was not doing that to make
anyone upset
or, like, make anyone unfocused.
- Bullshit.
- Then maybe next time
I will sing,
and maybe she'll get
another horrible dress
like she has on now.
- Tyra, do you think this really
has to do with the music
or something else?
- They're testing me.
- Mm-hmm.
- And it's like, kind of
pissing me off.
Morgan, do you think
I'm a bitch?
- No, I think you have a goal.
- Raven, do you think
I'm a bitch?
- No.
Sahara, do you think
I'm a bitch?
- I think sometimes
you're selfish.
- I think you need manners,
girl.
- Just because I--
when you give me a compliment
I don't give you one back
doesn't mean
I don't have manners.
- Girl, I know I'm gorgeous.
You don't need to tell me
anything, miss thing.
Just get yourself some manners
so you won't look
so damn stupid.
- [laughs]
- We're gonna move beyond this.
I think this is
another challenge
that we will all
have to overcome.
And we'll have to take it
into account.
Just promise me
we will be queens.
Now, while you wait in
the Interior Illusions Lounge,
the judges and I
will deliberate.
You may leave the stage.
Let's start with Jujubee.
- I'm a huge Jujubee fan.
She comes out here,
she works the runway,
her style choices are always
very nudge-nudge, wink-wink.
It's charming.
- I think the dress
drowned her out a little bit.
You know, there was a lot
going on.
- I told Jujubee last week
to turn up the fire.
And I'm not sure
if she's turned it up
to full capacity.
Jessica Wild.
Now, I liked the dress because
it actually works for her.
- I didn't like the top part.
- The fan thing? Yeah.
- It was very<i> quinceañera.</i>
I think her style is pretty bad.
- Mathu, she did take your
pointers with the makeup.
- And I am well impressed that
she did do it.
She didn't have the heavy brow.
- Right.
- And she took her bang away.
- That's right.
- Pandora Boxx.
Now, Martha,
you did not like her dress.
- It didn't do a thing for her.
She just dissolved
into that dress.
- She went for a whole other
persona, this kind of--
- She took a chance.
- Bridal realness.
I thought it was a full show.
- My problem with
Miss Pandora Boxx all along
is it's like, um, blah.
Like all of her fashion
choices--
It's not even like, "they're
hideous; they're horrible"
as it's like, "Eh;
there you are."
- Miss Tyra "boom boom" Sanchez.
She's a showgirl.
She's the one your eyes go to.
- I was blown away.
- For Tyra, the biggest problem
is what?
- All the girls hate her.
- I think
she's a great performer.
I don't feel
a lot of warmth from her.
- Her attitude sucks.
And if it was up to me,
I'd vote her off right now.
- Tatianna.
If she did not have
immunity this week,
she would be in the bottom two.
- Hello.
- Yes.
- Tatianna gets the beautiful
thing a lot.
- Yeah.
- But she gets the ugly dress
thing a lot too.
She gets the ugly dress thing
a lot.
She's gotten that
more than once.
- Sahara.
Did not like her dress.
- Skimpy tutu.
- It wasn't enough tulle.
I mean, for drag,
you have to exaggerate things.
- Sahara was a little dry.
- Yeah, she was a little dry.
Raven.
I loved Raven's outfit.
- She was the other standout.
- She was the other standout.
Love the bows.
- I was loving her<i> Elle</i><span style="bodyStyle"> bride</i>
blue shoe.
- Morgan McMichaels.
I have to say
I did not like her dress.
- A pouf skirt
is kind of hard to pull off.
- She never does
serious fashion.
She always does costume.
- Did Morgan improve her makeup?
- She's still doing
her signature Morgan look,
but it didn't look magic marker
this time.
- [claps]
Silence.
I've made my decision.
Bring the girls back.
Ladies.
As we witnessed here tonight,
tensions are running high.
I will not tolerate problems
between my girls.
We are all in this together.
Now, based on the wedding
challenge
and your presentation
on the main stage tonight,
I've made some decisions.
Jujubee.
Today in that dress,
you owned everything.
You're safe.
- Thank you.
- Jessica.
<i>Mucho escandalo.</i>
You are safe.
Tyra Sanchez.
This week, you raised the bar
on this competition.
Again.
Please do not
lower its standards.
- I'm scared that Ru is going
to look at me and say,
"Tyra Sanchez,
you are in the bottom two."
- Tyra Sanchez.
Congratulations, you're
the winner of this challenge.
- Thank you.
- In addition to receiving
immunity next week,
you've won a five-night
villa vacation
at the Hyatt Palm Springs.
Thank you, Tyra, you may join
the other girls.
- Thank you.
[Mendelssohn's<i> Wedding March]</i>
I'm just in tears.
I was, like, boo-hoo crying.
[sobbing]
I thought that I was going home.
- Tatianna.
Based on the judges' feedback,
your bride would have been left
at the altar.
But you have immunity this week.
You're still in the race.
- Thank you.
- Sahara Davenport.
Your presentation
was very<i> Swan Lake.</i>
Unfortunately, that story
does not have a happy ending.
I'm sorry,
you're up for elimination.
Pandora Boxx.
You're safe.
- Thank you.
- Raven.
You're safe.
- Thank you.
I should have won
that fuckin' challenge.
Everyone in that fuckin' room
will agree with me.
- Morgan McMichaels.
- [laughs]
- Why are you laughing?
- I always laugh.
It's a nervous thing, I think.
- I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
Two queens stand before me.
Prior to tonight,
you were asked to prepare
a lip-sync performance
to<i> Carry On</i>
by the one and only Martha Wash.
Now, this song means
a great deal to me
because when my mother,
who had suffered
from a long bout with cancer
finally passed away,
I was listening to this song
incessantly.
It has a lyric--
mama said, never give up.
And I've used it as my anthem.
I want each of you girls
to know that,
even through adversity or death,
love and energy lives forever.
Now.
This is your final chance
to impress me
and save yourself
from elimination.
The time has come
for you to lip-synch...
for your life.
Good luck,
and don't fuck it up.
[applause]
- Ladies.
I have made my decision.
Sahara Davenport.
Shante, you stay.
- Yes.
If I have to, I'll take each of
these bitches down one by one.
Morgan McMichaels.
- Yes.
- Take strength in the words
of Martha's song.
A new day will dawn.
Carry on.
Now...
sashay away.
- Thank you.
[applause]
- I couldn't even look.
When she was walking off,
I would not look at her.
I would not look up.
- Hello, mom.
I'm coming home.
I didn't serve it the way the
judges wanted me to serve it.
I'm not bitter, I'm not crazy.
I haven't cared what people
thought about me
the whole time I've been here.
I'm not gonna start now.
I care about
what I think about me.
And if I'm happy with me, then
that's good enough, right?
- To all my dolls.
We'll see you next week.
And remember...
If you can't love yourself,
how in the hell are you gonna
love somebody else?
Can I get an amen in here?
all: Amen.
- Let the music play.

-<i> Previously</i>
<i>on</i><span style="bodyStyle"> RuPaul's Drag Race...</i>
And then there were three.
Jujubee.
- What a sin. Ah!
I have never been blown
like that.
- I just absolutely loved her.
I thought she was dynamite.
- Miss Tyra.
Was your barbecue cancelled?
Your grill is fucked up.
- Tyra Sanchez, the other Tyra.
- I'm America's sweetheart.
Happy birthday, Mr. President.
- What do the bags say?
They say "Santino"?
[uproarious laughter]
It's daddy's little girl.
Tyra Sanchez, you raised the bar
on this competition.
Oh, my sweet gherkins!
You tore it up, Miss Thing.
Raven.
- Am I a ten?
Cocka-doodle-doo.
- The blending.
It's severe up in here.
- A perfect ten.
- I would not leave my man
in a room alone with you.
- Don't do it.
I'll work...it.
- One of you will be crowned
the next drag superstar.
And tonight...
[all screaming]
The final three queens
go head-to-head
and toe-to-toe.
- Oh!
- Snap out of it, girl.
In this season's
stunning conclusion...
Ladies, America's
next drag superstar is...
[cheering]
The winner
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i>
will receive a lifetime supply
of NYX cosmetics
and be the face
of nyxcosmetics.com,
an exclusive
one-year PR contract
with the leading LGBT firm
Project Publicity,
be featured in l.a.Eyeworks'
legendary
designer eyewear campaign
and headline
Logo's<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> Tour</i>
featuring
exceptional Absolut drinks,
and a cash prize of $25,000.
And may the best woman win.
- Top three, bitches.
- Oh, I know that's right.
- Get up in here.
- "Do you to the fullest.
Love, Tati."
I saw so much more in Tatiana.
She just kind of halted
and stopped.
- You gonna clean this mirror?
- Why do I have to clean it?
- 'Cause you out-lip-synch her.
- And you sent her home.
And that was your friend.
- How did you feel having
to lip-synch for your life
a third time?
- I thought I was going home.
-<i> Memoirs of a Gay-sha:</i>
<i>The Story of Jujubee--</i>
both:<i> I'm still here.</i>
- What if I wasn't here,
though?
- Then Tati would be here, and
there would be no competition.
Only a competition
between me and Raven.
- We're in the top three.
- Ah!
[all laughing]
There were two times
where I thought, "Fuck."
And it was the times
I was having
to lip-synch for my life,
and I thought, "Damn it."
- Oh, there were three times
where I thought that too.
- But we made it, bitch.
- I thought I was going home
that week
when all my bridesmaids
fucking jumped on me.
- I think you need manners,
girl.
- You don't need to tell me
anything, Miss Thing.
It was just like,
"I need to let her know."
'cause I didn't want you
to go home and--
and be like that with people
and have people talk about you
and you not wonder why.
- But you said it
in front of Ru,
which made the judges think
a completely different thing
about me.
- It did at the time,
and now they see it
differently,
and they see that you've grown.
So I did you a favor.
[clicks tongue]
- Ooh, girl.
You've got she mail.
Well, look who's here.
The best of the best.
You stand on the shoulder pads
of a dynasty of drag queens
who have come here before you.
So forget about those
bickering real housewives.
They ain't seen
nothing yet...
till they go head-to-head
and toe-to-toe
with the realness
that's about to explode
as one queen survives the fight
to be crowned
America's next drag superstar.
[car engine running]
- Surprise.
- Good for us.
- Hello, hello.
- Whoo.
I'm shocked.
I'm like, "Oh, my God,
what are you guys doing here?"
- Congratulations on making it
into the final three.
all: Thank you.
- We're here because RuPaul
is getting ready
for your final challenge,
inspired by some
of the great bitchy catfights
of all time.
You'll be costarring
in RuPaul's new music video,<i> </i>
<i>Jealous of My Boogie.</i>
- You'll need to learn
to fight dance
with choreographer
Ryan Heffington.
- And then with video director
Mathu Anderssen
you'll each have your moment
to act opposite RuPaul
in an over-the-top
dramatic scene.
- Plus, you'll work
with style expert Robert Verdi
to turn out two looks
inspired by '80s
power bitch fashion.
- This is your moment to show us
every bit of the charisma,
uniqueness, nerve,
and talent you've got.
- Gentlemen,
start your engines.
And for the last time...
both: Don't fuck it up.
- Not only are we that one step
closer to winning this,
but we're now gonna be
in RuPaul's new video.
[all screaming]
So we need to be on our A game.
This is the final challenge.
- [lisping] I'm so excited
right now, guys.
- Hello.
- Hi, ladies.
How's it going?
- Hi, I'm Jujubee.
- Hi, I'm Ryan.
- The first thing
that we go out to learn
is the fight choreography
with choreographer
Ryan Heffington.
- So let's go from the top.
Let's come up here.
The inspiration for this piece
was taken from the classic
TV show<i> Dynasty.</i>
It's bitchy, it's exciting,
it's campy.
So from the get-go,
it's a stomp, stomp, stomp.
You're a video vixen now,
yeah, okay?
I just think they really have
to be stars,
you know, when they're
in front of the camera.
They should already be living
as if, you know,
they are the new RuPaul.
- Five, six, hup.
- Go.
Up, down, up, up, ah.
Up, up--
- Ryan's very just high-octane.
He's very, like, "Duh, duh."
- [scatting]
Ooh, uh, fucking fierce, uh.
Pop pop, pop pop.
Four, five, six,
seven, eight.
Click, click, click,
click, click, click.
Hup, hup, hup.
Walk it out.
A little bit of booty
thrown in.
Pff, pff, pff,
pop pop, pop pop.
Yes, cool.
- He is the tiniest
little fiercest
little white man
in the world.
- Circle, circle, circle,
circle, circle, circle, circle,
and circle and circle
and circle.
- Fuck, I keep--
I forget that part.
I think it's gonna be hard
counting out those first beats
to know when we start circling
like a shark.
- Raven's a little bit slow
picking up choreography,
and that's a little bit
of a concern.
Click.
Other side, click, click.
- So it's--
- Not back to front.
- Okay.
- Let's listen to it 'cause
what--it's really fast, okay?
- Tyra's really monotone
with her attitude,
which makes me
a little bit nervous
because you need to be
hitting it in rehearsal
in order to hit it later on.
One, two, three, four.
Five, six, seven, eight.
This has to be bigger.
Don't fake it, yeah?
If they don't bring
their personality
and the steps are a little shy
of being what they should be,
it could be a disaster.
So and then I think from there,
you guys just kind of catfight
like true<i> Dynasty</i><span style="bodyStyle"> fashion.</i>
This is where it gets
really dramatic.
Five, six, seven, eight!
It shouldn't be
six, seven, eight.
It should be six, seven, bam!
And smack her, okay?
- Keep your heels off my toes.
- Keep your toes
under my heels.
I hope these bitches
don't take my eye out.
- And you're just gonna put
your hand on her wig.
So you have to really be careful
of her heels.
- The timing needs to be perfect
so it looks real.
- Hit, five, six, seven, eight.
Uh-huh.
Jujubee's overall realness
of being totally catty
and bitchy,
if she can really bring that
up to another level,
it'll be great.
Let's go back from here.
Just shake it down.
We have 15 minutes.
Let's go.
Ah, ah, ah.
See, you have to hold.
You come across, Raven.
You go one, two, three, four,
and look, six, seven, eight,
then walk, two, three, four,
to shove.
- Got it, okay.
- Yeah?
- When you're doing it
with three people total
and two of them are nailing it
and you're over there,
like, barely hammering it--
I'm thinking this is
gonna be a catastrophe.
- Okay, cool.
Thanks, ladies.
- Thank you.
- Bye.
- I know y'all jealous of my
[high-pitched voice] boogie.
- Don't be jealous
of my boogie.
- Oh, my God,
I feel so fierce.
Did you guys ever think
that when you were a little boy,
that you were gonna be
in a RuPaul video?
- No.
- No, me neither.
I thought I was gonna be
a doctor.
We have a ton of stuff to do
for this video shoot, okay?
We have to do a scene
with RuPaul.
We have to learn the words.
- Ru?
- Who is it?
- Who is it?
Like, with attitude.
- Who is it?
We have to prepare
a fight scene,
and then we have lunch
with Ru.
- Five, six, seven, eight.
- Hi, Ru.
- Tyra Sanchez, have a seat.
- Thank you.
- The other Tyra.
Two.
- Thank you.
- You've come a long way.
- What's been the toughest part
of this?
- Staying focused
and not worrying so much
about my son
and what's going on back home.
Like, and I'll pray to God,
and the tears just fall.
- Why do you cry, though,
when you pray?
- Because I just feel
that God is listening.
I held it in for a long time,
and, like, that's what made me,
like, angry.
- Anger is always
a symptom of fear.
What are you afraid of?
- I'm afraid of losing my son.
I really, really want to be
a better father to Jeremiah.
- So winning this contest
would mean what to you?
- I've been through so much
from being kicked out
to living on my own
and then raising a son.
So it's like a fresh start.
Just because I made mistakes
doesn't mean his life
has to be a mistake.
I was so surprised that I told
her about things in my past,
what went on with me.
Ru has definitely, like, grown,
to be, like, my drag mother.
- Thank you, Tyra.
- Thank you.
- Hey, Jujubee.
How are you?
- Hi.
- What's going on? I'm Robert.
- Nice to meet you.
Robert Verdi is giving me
a consultation.
I'm like, "Oh, my God,
you smell so good
and you're so handsome."
- I'm gonna give you
an outfit to wear,
and I'm gonna help you pick out
an '80s look in your wardrobe.
You have to channel these
dramatic fabulous women
of the '80s.
Are you aware of any of them?
- No.
- What year were you born?
- '84.
- Oh, my God.
- I know.
- [mouths words]
What do you think you're
gonna do for this challenge?
- Does this do anything?
- These two things
go hand in hand?
- Yeah.
- It looks more
Ringling Brothers than '80s.
- I've seen
Whitney Houston's videos.
She just looked
like she was going to the prom.
- This has an '80s vibe,
but the shoulder would be...
- Bigger, right?
- More defined.
The waist would be more defined.
Who were the women
in the canon of history
that you look to
for inspiration?
- Honestly,
I look at Mary J. Blige,
and I look at, like,
the Beyoncés and all that.
- It's not really history.
- Yeah, and, you know--
- That's contemporary.
- I'm a little nervous.
I have no idea where to start.
- Hello, Raven.
- Hello, how are you?
- Have a seat, darling.
- We get to go have
a one-on-one lunch with Ru.
- Oh, a buffet.
- Yes.
- Would you like a mint,
darling?
- Just one.
- Just the one.
- There.
- Thank you.
Sitting there having lunch
with RuPaul
was one of the most surreal
things I've ever done.
- You know,
I wonder what it's like
to be sequestered this way.
Do you feel like
a prisoner of war?
- I mean, I do miss
talking to my mom.
I speak to my dad, you know,
a couple times a month.
I guess I'm closer with my mom
than I am my dad.
- They're not together.
- No.
- When did they separate?
- When I was seven.
- You know, I--
my parents divorced
when I was seven also.
It was really tough on me,
and I think I went into music,
into sort of
an imaginary world.
What reaction did you have
to their divorce?
- I look at my mother.
She's, like, my golden
Oscar statue, you know?
And I love her.
And when I saw
what she went through
with my father's divorce,
it killed me.
And I swore, I said,
"I will never do that
to anybody in my life."
And whenever I've gotten
into a relationship,
it's really killed me
because I'm, like,
"Why do I have to be
my mom now?"
And a lot of times when you're
with someone and they hurt you,
you don't want to have
anything else to do with them.
- Expectations
lead to resentments,
and when you allow people
to just be themselves,
the relationship
can really grow.
- It was very nice to sit there
and talk with Ru one-on-one
and it be about me,
not all about drag and shop
and all that.
- Our lunch has to end now.
Can we get a doggy bag?
- Thank you.
- [laughing]
- Tell me about your persona.
Tell me about Tyra.
- Well, Tyra is, like,
sophisticated, glamorous.
- Okay, you're gonna be
shooting a video,
and your characters
are going to be styled
to look like they're
'80s vixens.
It was a decade of power
for women,
and women were really defined
stylistically
with very sharp shoulders,
very small waist,
and some bling.
- I wasn't born
when the '80s were hot.
I was born in the late '80s,
like, '88.
- You have the privilege
of working
with one of the most amazing
performers in the world,
who draws inspiration
from the most incredible women
in history.
And you should probably
take a minute to research
because I think you'll be able
to refine your character.
- Darling.
- Hi.
- Welcome.
- How are you?
- Have a seat.
- I will.
- How many
of these delicious mints?
- Just two.
- The two.
I'm on a diet,
so I'll just have one.
You were in the bottom two
three times.
- Three times.
- How did that happen?
- Well, I've been in
the bottom two three times here,
and I've been in the bottom two
a lot of times beforehand.
- Tell me about that.
- Just growing up, you know,
having people
just make fun of you.
I used to answer to faggot.
- Really?
- I just accepted it
'cause I knew it wouldn't stop,
and then finally, I just said,
"You know, don't call me that."
- Wow.
You know,
you got a lot of strength
for such a young lady.
What do you think your dad would
think of you in this contest?
- Oh, he would give me
the biggest hug,
and he would say,
"Go for it."
You know,
now it's Jujubee's journey.
Talking to Ru today,
she brought up situations
that I never talk about,
and it was just so comforting
to have her just listen.
- Thank you, darling.
- Thank you so much, mama.
- All right,
I'll see you later on.
- So do you have
any reference point
for what this challenge
is about?
- I would picture
the Carringtons.
- You do picture
the Carringtons.
- Yes.
- So you do know who they are.
- Yes.
- Are you the oldest
of the remaining--
- I'm the oldest.
- So you actually have
maybe an upper hand in it
'cause you were more in tune
to this decade
than the other two would be.
- Yes.
If you want to work
and you want to have longevity
in this business,
you need to know a little bit
about everything.
- [laughs]
I love that jacket.
How many shoulder pads
are in yours?
- Two.
I'm like--
- Are you ready?
Are you ready?
- You got black nail polish?
- Mm-hmm.
Should I even risk it
and try to polish them?
- That's up to you, girl.
This is a competition.
- Let's make movies.
Okay, here we go.
- So I'm the first one out
for the dramatic scene with Ru.
- Action.
- RuPaul.
- Who is it?
- Step into her, Raven.
- RuPaul.
- Who is it?
- I really need to talk to you.
I know that--
I forgot what my--my line is.
- Cut.
And action on Raven.
- RuPaul.
- You know I can't see you
before the show.
It's against the rules.
- Well, I'm sick of your rules,
I'm sick of your challenges,
and I'm sick of your show.
- Cut.
Try and get a little more
roller coaster in your ride.
- Okay.
- Do you know what I mean?
- I'm sick of your rules,
I'm sick of your challenges,
and I'm sick of your show.
What about me?
What about Raven?
- I was a little disappointed
at first with Raven,
but she took direction,
and she paid attention,
and there was
an actual progression.
- What about Raven?
Oh! Oh. Oh!
Oh! Oh.
- Ru?
- Who is it?
- I am so glad
I caught you alone.
- Cut.
Can you just make it
a little more seductive,
just throw in a bit of that?
Action.
- What about me?
What about Tyra?
- Snap out of it.
Pull yourself together, girl!
- Cut.
I want you to play this
a little bit--
it's like
when she shuts you down,
be really hurt
when she slaps you,
be really hurt.
- Like, hood?
Like how hood?
- Go for it.
- Oh, hood or hurt?
- Hurt.
- When he said "hurt,"
I thought he said "hood."
- Well, do we want that?
- That sounds pretty good.
- I am sick of your rules.
What...about me?
- Snap out of it, girl.
You better pull yourself
together.
- You are just jealous
of my boogie.
- [laughing]
- [laughing]
- Hello, darling, you gorgeous
little shoulder-padded monster.
- I feel 100% confident
about this.
I was a theater major, honey.
I know what to do.
- And action.
- RuPaul.
- I can't see you
before a show.
It's against the rules.
- I'm tired of these rules.
I'm tired of the challenges.
I'm tired of this show!
What about me?
What about Jujubee?
Ah!
[babbling tearfully]
- Jujubee came fully loaded
and a surprise
by throwing herself
on the floor.
- You're jealous of my boogie!
- But Jujubee
just is a drag clown.
Cut.
Cut, cut, c-cut, c-cut, cut.
- Right from the top, please.
- Would you do it
once more for me?
- What about me?
What about Jujubee?
- Snap out of it.
- [singing indistinctly]
Oh, yes, I'll do that.
Oh!
It's time for us to shoot
the dance routine
for RuPaul's video.
I'm so excited!
It's us three.
We're the Supremes right now,
okay?
And we have to shoot
this video,
and it needs to be perfect.
Are we all doing bodysuits?
- Oh, those look too big.
- Raven and I got ready
so quickly.
- Yeah, you could see my
bathing suit lines in it.
Oh, well.
- We picked out our outfits.
We put it on.
I feel like Lucy Liu.
- I don't like these.
That looks too small,
doesn't it?
- Tyra had to go
through every fucking thing.
- Can I fit this?
Can I put on a tutu?
I don't like this.
Look at my stomach.
You don't buy stuff in my size,
do y'all?
- Girl, they gave me
these clothes; they fit me.
You're just a little taller
than I am.
Like, you can find something.
- This isn't gonna work.
At all. None of this.
I have so much to choose from.
It was just so hard
to choose something
that would top everything
I've done this entire season.
- How are you feeling, Tyra?
- They didn't have no fucking
Clothes to fit me.
And now I don't feel pretty.
- Action!
- One, two, three, four,
five, six!
Hup, hup!
[RuPaul's<i> Jealous of My Boogie]</i>
- While we are performing
this routine
in front of the cameras
and everything,
I realize that
we're shooting a video.
And I'm like,
"Jujubee, be in the moment
and just do it
and just be fabulous."
- Five, six, hup, girls!
- And hup!
Hup!
Hup!
- In the catfight,
he wanted us to make it real.
And I'm showing, bitch,
this is serious.
We're in a catfight.
Don't be jealous of my boogie.
- In a real fight, you don't
hold back because she's pretty.
- [laughs]
- I didn't pull
anybody's wigs off.
Tyra snatched
Ms. Raven's wig twice.
- My wig didn't come off.
I had it pinned on
the right way.
They knew we was shooting
a video.
- You got three drag queens
rolling around
on top of each other.
There's heels, wigs,
jewelry, nails.
Something's bound to happen.
- Ow, my eye.
Ow, ow, ow.
- You okay?
- Ow, ow, this one.
Is it bleeding?
- No.
- Oh, my God.
- Open it up.
You want me to blow?
- It went right
into that heel.
Let's just give Jujubee
a moment.
- Do I look fine?
If I look fine,
I'll keep going.
- You look fine.
- Okay, let's do it.
- Fix your wig.
- [grunts]
- Yeah, I think she's got
the fighting thing down.
- Do I even have makeup
left on my face?
- Yes, you do.
- Ow.
- Yes.
[clapping]
- Y'all bitches
got your ass whooped.
- You okay, mama?
- It burns.
But I can't do anything
about it.
I just hope it doesn't swell up.
There's a cut right there.
And it's bruising right here.
I put makeup over it,
a little bacteria cream,
and I was like,
"Let's just keep doing it."
This doesn't look '80s to you,
huh?
- I think it looks more '70s.
I see Juju and Tyra,
and I realize they don't know
a thing about<i> Dynasty</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
or<i> Knott's Landing</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
or<i> Dallas,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> none of that.</i>
- Why wasn't I born earlier?
- So I think maybe I have
an upper hand
on what my look should be.
I'm channeling Lisa Lisa,
I'm channeling Kelly LeBrock,
and I'm channeling Tina Marie.
- All I know is
'80s style is tacky.
It's huge ass shoulder pads.
It's big unruly, ugly hair,
really tiny waists,
and fat asses.
There we go, dahling.
- The way that
I'm gonna pull it together
for the '80s challenge is,
like, they had big hair,
they believed
in their chandelier earrings,
and they like
the Lite-Brite colors.
Do I look '80s?
- Yes.
You look like you're going
to the prom.
- What's wrong, mama?
- Nothing, baby.
My eye is just in pain
right now.
- Okay, well, basically
what we're gonna do is,
you're gonna be sharing
the same space.
I want you all to write "no"
at the same time.
- Okay.
- So, you know, it's like,
"No, no, no, no."
Yep. You ready?
Okay, here we go.
- Standby, track.
Here we go.
Track in.
- Track, please.
- I was giving
Michelle Pfeiffer bitch
when I was looking at myself
in that mirror.
I was like,
"I look fucking good."
- I know that I should win
this competition tonight
because I have worked
so much harder.
- I feel like I'm in my bedroom
lip-synching
to one of RuPaul's songs.
It's not me shooting
a music video.
It's me just being crazy
and just having fun.
Every boy in America sings in
front of the mirror to RuPaul.
You didn't know that?
- Purr for each other
a bit more.
- Okay, ladies, find it.
- Nice.
- [laughing]
Ooh, it's the last day.
[laughter]
- This is it.
- I know.
- So we all get into
the workroom this morning,
and we realize
this is the last time
we're gonna be walking in here.
And it's nerve-racking.
None of us can call it.
None of us knows
what's gonna happen.
- Did you honestly expect this?
- Yes.
- Me too.
[laughs]
- If you win, can you imagine?
- I know.
And it would gag
a whole bunch of people
that didn't believe in me.
- And that's the thing
I'm excited about.
There are those people
who are like,
"I think Raven's boring."
Yeah, so don't dance around it.
Don't sing live.
But I'm fierce at what I do,
so eat my fucking shit.
- How is it gonna change
your life, Tyra?
- I'll have a place to stay,
first of all.
And I'd be able to get my son
to come.
Like, he'll be able to stay
with me
and live with me there.
- Where are you staying now,
girl?
- Girl, I stay
with my drag mama.
I stay on her couch.
I need this.
I couldn't dare go home
without the crown and the title
of being America's
next drag superstar.
- So is anyone nervous?
- No.
Are you?
- I'm nervous.
- I'm nervous.
- I'm not nervous.
And I know being nervous
is normal and fine,
but I'm ready.
- [laughing]
- Hello, judges.
How are you, Santino?
- Doing great, Ru.
- Merle, how are you tonight?
- I'm nervous for the girls.
- We've made it
to the final lap.
Tonight, we're crowning
America's next drag superstar.
Santino, Merle,
you've been here
since the beginning.
You know these ladies
inside and out.
So tonight, there are no
guest judges, Miss Thing.
It's just family.
- Good.
- [laughs]
- Now are you ready for their
final main stage presentation?
- Ready.
- Bring it on.
- Gentlemen,
start your engines.
And may the best woman win.
Jujubee.
Ooh.
- Le pouf.
- I love this dress.
Oh, I was living for myself,
girl.
I wish I could have seen
my reflection.
- Yes, touch all of the skin.
- Touch all of the skin,
darling.
Oh...
I think Jujubee must have
bronzed her panties.
Ooh. Cabaret.
2010.
That's so Raven,
that's so cabaret.
- I feel fabulous.
I feel like, "Wow, I'm here.
I made it."
And I'm coming out
the way I want to come out.
-<i> Willkommen</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
to<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
And all that jazz.
Ooh.
Yes, mama. Style proper.
Tyra Sanchez, the other Tyra.
Yummy.
- Do you know
where you're going to?
- Yes. Mahogany.
I'm a winner, baby.
- I am so nervous right now.
And it hit me that, bitch,
you have a great chance at being
America's next drag superstar.
- The Beverly Hills Hotel.
- Ah, yeah.
- Polo Lounge.
- Yes. Poolside.
Oh, Tyra, darling.
Dive into the deep end.
Mm, the water's fine.
- [laughs]
- Welcome, ladies.
Tonight, one queen's life
will be changed forever.
Which one of you has
the charisma,
uniqueness, nerve, and talent
to be the next drag superstar?
Let's find out.
Jujubee.
Let's take a look at highlights
from your final challenge.
- I am tired of the rules.
I'm tired of these challenges.
I'm tired of your show.
What about me?
What about Jujubee?
- Hmm.
- Oh...
- Snap out of it, Jujubee.
Wow.
[laughing]
- Wow.
- Tell me about
the acting challenge.
Was it difficult?
- Not stepping into your light,
that was really, like,
my concern.
- Trust me, I moved all
the girls out of my light.
- If this was
a regular TV show or movie,
I would say, "Jujubee
is overacting like crazy."
But for<i> Dynasty</i><span style="bodyStyle"> '80s,</i>
it was perfect.
- I'm a little let down
that you've chose to wear
this dress at the end here.
I get where you were going
with it,
but not the perfect dress
for this evening.
- I think the necklace makes
the dress look less expensive
and less fashion.
- Do you want me
to take it off?
- Sure, if you want
to take it off.
- No, no, I'll take it off.
- Let's see what it looks like.
- Yeah, you look
so much more expensive and chic.
- Oh, right, yes, it does,
actually.
- I'm gonna leave it right here.
- Okay.
Now, if it winds up
in my pocketbook,
don't hate me.
- Girl, there's
three stars missing.
You can already have it.
[laughter]
- Next up, the other Tyra.
- I am sick of your rules,
your challenges, your show.
What about me?
What about Tyra?
- Snap out of it.
The fighting.
[chuckles]
You were pretty rough.
I couldn't take my eyes off
of you in that scene there.
- Usually when you see
girls fight,
they're not worried
about being pretty.
It's, "I'm gonna beat
this bitch ass,"
and so I'm like--
that's all I'm thinking.
I just wanted that
to really happen.
- You snatched her wig off.
- I didn't do it intentionally.
It was like
I was reaching for her,
and the wig came off, but--
- You didn't do it
intentionally twice?
- [laughs]
- Love the hair.
Love how just open
and popping your face is.
It's really stunning.
Overall, I think
it's a great look.
- Now, are you gonna let
your son watch this show?
- I think that this might be
the first time
that he realizes
what daddy does.
And I'm--I'm pretty sure
he's gonna--
we're gonna sit down
and watch it together.
- All right, Tyra.
Thank you very much.
- Thank you.
- Now let's move on
to Miss Raven.
- Well, I'm sick of your rules,
I'm sick of your challenges,
and I'm sick of your show.
What about me?
What about Raven?
- Come here.
Closer.
Let mommy make it better.
That was just too good
to pass up!
What was the toughest part
about the acting challenge?
- Looking at your face.
- [laughs]
I get that a lot.
[laughs]
- You always looked beautiful,
but that was--
probably the hardest part
was looking at your face
and trying not to just be
like--
- [laughing]
Now, what are you serving us
on the main stage tonight?
- Well, I have this corset,
and I think this just
kind of speaks for itself.
- What does it say?
- I'm the next drag superstar.
- [laughing]
- Don't slap me again,
please.
[laughter]
- I'm so in love
with this outfit.
I love a black, like,
floral thing
because you expect organza
and petals
to be kind of pink.
And when they're black,
it's kind of like this
weird Gothic feeling.
- In the fight scene,
there was a period of time
over a minute
where I couldn't even see you.
Tyra was standing up,
and, like, you kind of got lost.
- I didn't want to hurt anyone,
so I didn't go for it
completely.
- Your '80s look,
it was totally '80s.
If there's any time
in this whole competition
that you really looked
like Kelly LeBrock,
it was--
it was that time.
- All right.
Thank you.
Ladies.
While you wait in
the Interior Illusions Lounge,
the judges and I
will deliberate.
[car engine turns over]
Okay, here we are
at the moment...
- Oh, my God.
- That it all boils down to.
Let's start with Jujubee.
She has star quality.
- Mm-hmm.
- But is she
the next drag superstar?
- To me, in the context
of these three people,
she looked a little bit
like a tourist.
Her level of iconography
in terms of fashion and beauty
is not where the other two's is.
- She excelled
in the book challenge
because she's a clever girl.
She's clearly the most
intelligent of all the girls.
- I'm not sure.
- Really?
- I think Tyra
is incredibly intelligent.
- Let's talk about Tyra.
She's not polished.
She is very hood.
She's very street.
But the fact that she's learned
these old-school tricks
that we've seen displayed
on this stage
at such an early age
and wowed us with them--
even her tenacity to
"accidentally" rip her wig off,
you know, she's saying,
"I'm here."
- Right.
- "I'm the star."
- I love people
who are the shit
and know they are the shit.
I get both of that from--
from Tyra and Raven.
- Yeah.
- I just think her personality
is so interesting and complex.
And that is part of stardom.
- She's been able to show us
so many different looks
and be
so many different women.
- Raven is really more
the fashion-forward girl.
Raven has
undeniable star quality.
- Superstar quality.
- Mm-hmm.
You know, normally right now,
I would say
I've made my decision.
But I can't say that I have.
I must see them lip-synch
for their lives
to make my decision.
Silence.
Bring back...my girls.
Welcome back, ladies.
We've reached that point
in our journey
where one path ends
and another begins.
I'm so proud
of each and every one of you.
- It almost seems like
RuPaul's got a shotgun
and is just waiting to, like,
"Okay, you're not it,
you're not it."
That's what it feels like,
a sitting duck.
- Jujubee.
You've brought a light
to this competition
week after week,
a light that nothing
and no one can extinguish.
You are a bright star.
But sadly, you are not
the next drag superstar.
I'm sorry, Juju.
- Thank you.
- We will see you soon.
But for now, sashay away.
- Bye.
I'm not bitter.
I'm disappointed.
I wish I was up there
lip-synching.
But I'm still a winner,
and I'm proud of my girls.
I'll get my time.
"Love, Juju...B."
- Tonight, my two best girls
will lip-synch to my single
<i>Jealous of My Boogie.</i>
- This is my first time
I'm gonna have to lip-synch.
I am so nervous right now.
- Ladies, this is your last
chance to impress me
and win the title
of America's
next drag superstar.
- I'm ready to win this shit.
- The time has come...
for you to lip-synch...
for your life.
Good luck.
And for the last time,
don't fuck it up.
[upbeat pop music]
- I just went out there
and did what I usually do
and what I've done
for most of my drag career.
This is all about me.
- And I went
to the judges' table,
and I stood right there
in front of them.
I really gave it to them.
[laughter]
- [laughing]
Bravo, brava.
- Brava.
- That was amazing.
- Wow.
- Ladies.
I have made my decision.
The winner
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race,</i>
America's next
drag superstar, is...
Tyra Sanchez.
[applause]
- Oh, my God.
[hyperventilating]
- Girl, turn to the camera.
You want to take your shoes off?
Girl.
Do you need someone?
Can we get someone over here,
please?
She can't breathe. Literally.
- [continues hyperventilating]
- Tyra, you're gonna be okay.
- Are you okay?
- Okay, do you need water?
Do you need--
Does she need to breathe
in the paper bag?
- [exhales deeply]
It's like I had
an out-of-body experience
and I just--
for some reason,
I forgot to breathe.
- Just relax for now, Tyra.
We're gonna get your wig
back on your head.
Take your time, baby.
Tyra, you're gonna be okay.
We're gonna continue.
Raven.
I want to thank you
from the bottom of my heart.
You are unforgettable.
And that...is so Raven.
- Thank you.
- Good luck, my dear.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
Now sashay away.
- [silently] Thank you.
I came in second place.
That's an amazing thing
out of 12 people.
I'm gonna leave this competition
with my head held high.
I'm gonna go off
and do something fierce,
fabulous, fun, and funky,
the four Fs.
- My queen.
- Go girl.
Yes!
- Wear this crown with pride.
The other Tyra is dead.
Long live the new Tyra.
[applause]
All right.
- Being America's
next drag superstar
is going to change my life
dramatically.
I'll be able to take care
of Jeremiah,
and I'll be able to start
his future now.
- Tyra, let the world be
jealous of your boogie.
Now walk.
[applause]
- I am Tyra "the other Tyra"
Sanchez.
And I am America's next drag...
superstar.


<i>[Main Event</i><span style="bodyStyle"> playing]</i>

<i>as we sneak a peek</i>
<i>at the contestants'</i>
<i>outrageous audition tapes.</i>
<i>We'll count down</i>
<i>the top ten fits and fashions</i>
<i>of the runway,</i>
<i>with special guests Ongina,</i>
<i>Shannel,</i>
<i>and last year's winner,</i>
<i>BeBe Zahara Benet,</i>
<i>and outrageous moments</i>
<i>from our celebrity</i>
<i>guest judges,</i>
<i>plus an up close</i>
<i>and personal look</i>
<i>at our final three--</i>
<i>Raven, Tyra,</i>
<i>and Jujubee.</i>
- Welcome to an extra special
episode of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
Honey, this hour is jam packed.
- Face.
- Face.
- Beauty face.
Because when it comes
to<i> RuPaul's Drag Race,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
too much is never enough.
- $5.00.
Try something new.
- But before we race
to the finish line,
let's go back
and pay our respects
to the nine amazing queens
that didn't make it
to the winner's circle.
- Hey, everybody,
look at me.
Here I am.
- We are in my home.
I'm gonna show a few
of my things to you.
- Hey, RuPaul
and casting directors.
- I'm the one
you're looking for!
- Now, when Shangela
sent in her casting tape,
she'd been doing drag
for only three months.
- Now, you have to forgive me
because I had to drag myself
out of bed
to pull this video together.
[sniffles] Bitch think
he got the swine flu.
[sniffles]
- But what she lacked
in experience,
she made up for in enthusiasm,
showmanship,
and attitude.
- Some bitches,
when they in drag,
they are catty,
hateful hos.
But nobody likes a hateful ho.
Mm-mmm.
No, you need to be sweet
to people.
Girl, I got diesel breath.
[laughter]
- It's every single...
- Our next queen,
Nicole Paige Brooks,
was tasteful
and sophisticated.
In short, Atlanta eleganza.
- Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi!
- Hey!
- Wait a minute!
We just started,
and y'all are already breaking
my number one rule,
which is what?
If I can hear you over me,
you need to what?
- Shut the fuck up!
- You may remember me
from<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
season one,
when I almost made it,
and you got to see
my audition video on the show.
Just in case you don't remember,
here it is.
My name is Nicole--
my name is Nicole--
my name is Nicole Paige Brooks.
RuPaul.
- RuPaul.
- I need you to pick dada
this time.
- I need you
to pick dada this time.
- [laughing]
- We knew we loved
the marvelous Mystique
from the moment she shared
her most important
beauty secret--
two piece and a biscuit.
- Well, I already ate
that one piece,
and here's the other,
you know.
That two piece and a biscuit
can give you hips and curves
and everything else.
Drag for me
is a creative outlet,
and it's an expression on life,
and it's the art
of the illusion.
You know I'm a size 0,
the infinite number?
- Gotta eat that breast
and that biscuit
just to keep
that girlish figure.
Smooches.
- The lady Sonique
was nothing if not versatile.
She rocked so many looks,
she had us flippin' out.
- That's my Catwoman mask.
My new Catwoman mask.
Actually, the Black Cat.
[cheers and applause]
- Oh, yeah.
- These are my drag mother's
fire torches.
I gotta show you those.
[blowing]
- I knew that Morgan McMichaels
was my kind of queen
when she invited us
to check her out
in a back alley.
- My favorite place to walk
and give you a catwalk show
is in the alley.
I'ma start from way back here.
- So we're on a tour.
This is<i> RuPaul's Drag Race,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
in a audition video,
and this is my closet,
ladies and gentlemen.
We have bags of hair,
leather chaps,
leather leather,
leather leather shiny things.
You know drag queens
love shiny things.
- Sahara Davenport's
audition tape
showed some sass,
some class,
and even a little bit of ass.
- Hi!
I'm Sahara Davenport!
Drag means, to me, freedom
of expression definitely.
What I can say
is drag has taken me places
where my career as a dancer
was unable to.
If I had to describe Sahara,
I would say
she has the grace
of Debbie Allen.
Whoo!
And she's a big ol' man,
like RuPaul.
[laughing]
- Sexy Latina Jessica Wild
earned her spot on the show
by winning
an online casting contest
at rupaulsdragrace.com.
- For me, Jessica
is a gift to myself,
because it gave me opportunity
to do things that as David
I was afraid to do.
- In drag,
comedy and timing
can be as important
as a tight tuck.
Pandora Boxx's
hilarious audition tape
proved she understood
the importance of all three.
- Tell us, Pandora Boxx,
what is the secret
to your success?
- Well, Michael, you see--
Oh, hold on.
I hope you don't mind
if I do something.
- Uh...okay.
- I'm 37 years old...ooh.
I just--that's the first time
I think I've said it out loud.
It's only been a week.
I don't know if you know,
but I did audition last year.
I didn't make it, clearly,
and I'm not bitter.
It's a kind of like
a little, um...
like a Swiss Miss kind of--
well, it's best
I just show you.
[claps]
Here I am.
- Tatianna's audition tape
was second to none
when it came to femininity
and sheer beauty.
- And if I don't get chosen
this time,
I'm gonna try again
next season
and the season after that
and the season after that.
And you're eventually
going to get tired
of seeing my face,
so it's in your best interests
just to get it over with now
and put me on the show, 'kay?
- All these girls
have sashayed away,
but even though
they left the race,
they're still
spreading the love,
and you can catch their acts
all over the country.
Find out where.
Just go to rupaulsdragrace.com
and click.
- Can I get a amen.
Oh!
- This year's queens
tore up the main stage
like never before.
And to help me
count down the top ten
most unforgettable
fits and fashions,
I've invited
three unforgettable queens
from last season--
the divine Ongina,
the fabulous Shannel,
and last season's winner,
the queen herself,
the incredible
BeBe Zahara Benet.
Cameroon!
[laughter]
Hi, ladies.
- Hi, Ru.
- Welcome back
to the<i> Drag Race.</i>
- Thanks for having us.
- Shannel, you moved
to another city.
- Seattle.
- Now, did<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
change your life?
- The world.
All three of us--
we've just been in every city,
and it's been--
it's been amazing.
- Yeah, I've been reading
about you all,
and, BeBe, you moved
to a new city, too, didn't you?
- New York.
- People recognize you
on the street?
- Yeah, and that's
overwhelming too.
- So you've been watching
the show.
- Crazy 12 girls
you have there.
- I put together
the top ten list
of the most unforgettable
fits and fashions
on the runway.
Coming in at number ten
are the death-defying drops
of Miss Two Piece and a Biscuit
herself, Mystique.
Whoa!
Wow.
It always felt like she was
gonna break something.
- She dropped it
like it was hot.
- She sure did.
[laughter and applause]
Now, do any of you
do splits at all?
- Mm-mm.
- No?
I would think you could,
Shannel.
- I'll juggle, but no splits.
- Yeah, only in the comfort
of my own bedroom.
- [laughing]
- Honey, she had one foot
on the dresser.
- I think big girls
are always fabulous, though.
- Being a big girl,
you knew
that she had to pull out
all the stops.
- She's pretty too.
- She is pretty.
- Very pretty.
She's not afraid
of the cosmetics.
- No.
- She will get in there,
and she'll paint
for the Rose Bowl, honey.
- Yes, indeed.
Oh, yes.
She baked it
like Betty Crocker.
She did a thing
called cooking her makeup.
Do you guys cook?
- I mean, the queens
have to cook.
- Well, it's when you put
your foundation on your face
and you let it sit and warm to
your own body's temperature...
- I never knew that.
- So that it's--yeah.
- I cook.
- I'm cooking right now,
right?
I'm actually wearing
a Crock-Pot right now.
- Oh, okay.
- [laughs]
- Bet you can't guess
where it is.
- [laughs]
- I'll give you a hint.
It's near my lovin' oven.
[all laugh]
- I really like
her personality.
- Yeah.
- Yes.
- Now, after the burlesque show,
we asked our girls
to walk the runway
in their best high-class drag.
Coming in at number nine
is Miss Tatianna,
who brought it home
in Galliano realness.
Now, what did you think
of her dress?
- It was prom-y,
a little too short.
- I would've liked it
to have swept the ground.
- And a little train.
- Mm-hmm.
- Maybe not the earrings
with the necklace.
- But, you know,
give or take a necklace
or an earring or two,
that was one of her best looks.
Now, everybody knows my girls
are the crème de la crème,
but coming in at number eight
is Miss Jujubee in her getup
from the
Starrbootylicious episode.
Now, Jujubee was wearing her
"Imelda Marcos goes to the prom
in the Ashford &amp; Simpson
collection from Sears" dress,
but it was gorgeous.
You know, normally
that could not work,
but something about her humor
pulls that off.
- She seemed very bubbly
and kind of peppy.
I think she paints
really, really well.
- Reminds me
of a little Ongina.
[laughter]
- I like her
because she's Asian.
So go, Asians!
- Without the hair.
- Well, yeah.
No, she's--
I really like that dress.
- Yeah.
- I mean, you know,
if I wore that dress,
it would probably drown me,
but for her, it works.
- It works for her.
- And I think it's gorgeous.
- And, you know,
there's a certain consciousness
that Jujubee has that is, um...
it's kind of got a wink
to everything that she does,
and it made it work.
- She was a real transformation,
too, from boy to girl.
- I was surprised.
- Big difference there.
- Yes.
- Big difference.
- Yeah.
I think with a lot
of the kids this season
that the difference is huge.
- Yeah.
- I like her boy name too.
It's Airline.
- Oh, that's right.
- Yeah, it's amazing.
- Yeah.
- No, I think that her--
She could actually use her
boy name as a drag name, yeah.
- Sure.
- But Jujubee is great.
- Jujubee is fantastic.
Do you know the meaning
of "jujubee," what that means?
- No.
- I think it's a--
- It's a candy.
- Yes, well, the--
it is, I think, in Thailand,
the truckers who are
traveling cross-country
chew this candy to stay awake
at night.
- Because it gets stuck
in your teeth
and then you can't even separate
your gums,
and you spend more time
picking it out of your teeth
than you do swallowing it.
- She has pizzazz,
and she's always going, "Pah."
- In the Country Queens episode,
Jessica Wild's country couture
left the others in the dust,
and it has her coming in
at number seven.
Was she bootylicious or what?
- Hip-alicious, bootylicious--
she's padded for life.
- Now, of course,
she was padded.
Now, you don't pad,
do you, Ongina?
- No.
- And, of course, Shannel
doesn't need to pad,
because she's got it.
- Junky trunk, right?
- Now, um, our queen--
any tips for padding
for the kids out there?
- Um, I don't pad.
- Oh, you don't pad?
[laughter]
- I don't pad.
- That's a lie.
- Do you think
that Jessica's pad job
was acceptable by our queen?
- Well, you know what?
- I just--of course it's due.
- Yeah, yeah.
- I think it was--yeah.
It was realistic,
but then again,
you have to figure out
how tall you are
and how short you are
to make it that realistic.
- Right.
- You know?
- So I shouldn't get that made.
- Well, you can get it made,
but you have to--
- In that size.
- You can make it to your body.
- Oh, okay.
- Right.
- Some girls, you know,
only pad here
when they really should pad,
like, say, from the knee up,
or they may have--
They may--a lot of times,
girls, I think
will put their pads too low,
too,
because they want to hear
a lot of hip hugger things.
And then they've got, you know,
an ass that sits on the ground,
which, I mean,
I'm the last one to talk,
but, you know, see...
- Well, I think that Jessica
did her padding very well
this time.
Now, we asked our judges
to work the runway,
and divas like Kathy Griffin,
Dita Von Teese,
and Miss Debbie Reynolds
showed us queens a thing or two
about being fabulous.
Coming in at number six
are the stunning runway stylings
of our<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> judges.</i>
What'd you think
of our star power
on the runway this year?
- Kathy Griffin coming out
with the damn bar--
but I love
Debbie Reynolds too.
- Debbie Reynolds.
- Oh, my God, she's adorable.
- She introduced herself
as Princess Leia's mother.
And Henry Rollins--he gets
sexier with age, actually.
- If you need a housekeeper.
- Talking about sexy,
Dita Von Teese...
- Oh, yes.
- Amazing...
- Yeah, true living pinup.
- In the Rocker Chick challenge,
my girls had
to transform themselves
into rock star divas.
And together, they come in
at number five
on the countdown.
- I was really impressed
with Raven and Tatianna.
- Especially Raven--
I think that the hair was just--
the color contrast
was really hot.
- Well, she was paying homage
to Terri Nunn,
who was from the group Berlin,
and that was Terri Nunn's
trademark hairdo.
Now, I know that you did
the rap on my song.
- Yes.
- And you have a song out now.
- Yeah.
- What's it called?
-<i> I'm the Shit.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
- Oh, God.
[laughter]
Now there were a lot of looks
this season
that drew inspiration
from history's
greatest superstars.
But in the Once Upon a Queen
episode,
a star was born,
and that's why Raven
is number four
on the countdown.
- I love Raven, and I also am
a huge Streisand fan.
So I loved it
'cause it was<i> Goldmember</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
meets<i> The Main Event.</i>
- It was a very surprising look
for her.
- She took out her piercing.
- She took out her piercings.
- Which made the look
a little bit more high glamour,
because if she would have
kept them on,
then it would have not worked
for me.
- Although I kind of
secretly would love
to see Barbra Streisand
with those piercings.
- Yeah.
- Can you imagine?
- Yeah.
Maybe she is pierced...
Down there.
[laughter]
- For the busy drag queen
on the go,
versatility is a must.
So I love it
when a single outfit
suddenly turns into two
or three or more.
Coming in at number three,
behold the many country looks
of Tyra Sanchez,
the other Tyra.
- If you're going to work
with the first outfit
and then you have to run out
to lunch
on the second outfit
and then dinner on the third--
- Right, and then
the escort agency calls.
[laughter]
- I like reveals,
because I think it keeps you
very interested
and it's, like,
the "oohs" and the "ahhs"
and really gives you
that whole showgirl
aspect of it.
- Yes.
In season one,
there were a few little spats
between the contestants.
Right, girls?
- Maybe.
- Just a few.
Well, this season,
we had a shootout
at the<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> Corral.</i>
Coming in at number two,
it's the terrible Ts,
Tyra versus Tatianna.
What are the judges not seeing?
- Tyra is a complete bitch.
- She talks so much shit
about so many people
but won't say it
to their face.
- The reality is in this field
there is so much cattiness.
After having been dressed
for so many hours
and under the lights
and all of that,
you know, tensions are high.
I mean, God knows in our season,
I mean,
I had lots of frustrations
myself.
Things happen.
Sometimes you just have
to vocalize it.
- All right, kids, we are down
to number one in our countdown.
- Ru, can I say something?
I think it's time I take over.
- Uh, BeBe, you may be
the next drag superstar,
but it's still my show.
- Well, I think the moment
has come for us
to reveal the most unforgettable
fits and fashion
from the runway all worn by you.
- Me?
- You!
- Me?
- Obviously you.
- Oh, my God.
I'm back.
- My favorite
is the very Lacroix one
with the pleats
and the three shades of cream,
beige, and a little lavender.
- I think that looks so pretty.
- That was our Wedding show.
I played the mother
of the bride.
- It's gorgeous.
- Then the red and black.
- Right, now that was very
Miss Ross.
- But it was so beautiful.
That was so striking
and the silhouette
of the body...
- And I love
all the ostrich feathers
on the lilac dress,
the strapless.
- What made some of those
outfits so fantastic
was the fact that you
changed hair color.
- Well, Mathu always wants
to top himself.
I think with
the punk rock outfit,
I think that's probably
the biggest hair
I've ever worn in my career.
Ladies, thank you so much
for stopping by.
I'm so happy
for all of your successes,
and I can't wait till we're all
on the<i> RuPaul Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> Tour</i>
all over the world.
- Thank you.
- Yes.
- Thank you
for making it happen.
- You guys make sure
you tune in next week
to see who will be crowned
the next drag queen superstar.
Now, I hope you're hungry...
- [belches]
- Because I've been digging up
some tasty tidbits,
unseen morsels,
and delicious
behind-the-scene nuggets.
[growls]
all: Cherry pie! Cherry pie!
Cherry pie!
- Now naturally, there was
some fierce competition
between the queens.
- It's a competition.
- But what impressed me the most
was the mutual love and support,
because when it comes to drag,
support is essential.
- I'm trying to get this bitch
just to stay on.
I hope I can make
some new drag sisters
to really give me some tips,
help a bitch out.
Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- We all genuinely want
each other to look good.
- Do you have time, baby,
to help me just put this on?
- People that are
helping each other,
they're helping each other
because they want them to stay.
- And so you just take
your white,
highlight all this area,
and make that pop.
Granted, this is a competition.
It's also a learning experience.
- You, like, want me
to wrap it around you?
- Put--poom, poom, poom, yeah.
This look too bad?
If you are going to win,
you are going to win
no matter what.
That's why if I need
to give you my panties,
I give you my panties,
because if I'm going to win,
I'm going to win
with or without panties.
- Our girls weren't afraid
to talk about anything,
including a drag queen's
best kept secret.
I'm talking about padding.
Are you a padded queen?
- I do pad, yes.
- I wear hip pads, yeah,
but I don't wear a butt pad,
'cause I have
a little bit of a--
- Okay.
- Did you see my ass?
Did you see my hips?
Boys don't have that.
I molded that.
- I think you've got
quite a shape there.
- Well, yesterday,
I wore hip pads.
- Wow, some of these girls,
they're pretty cute,
but if you're trying to do drag,
use your pads to look
at least like a girl.
- Now, you don't have padding.
You're not a padded queen.
- I like being thin.
I like--I modeled myself after,
like, a supermodel.
We're not like that in L.A.
We don't pad.
That's an East Coast, Midwest,
Southern thing
where they're pageant girls.
- It's private,
you know what I mean?
I'm putting on my body.
- This season,
the drag queens proved
that they were talented
celebrity impersonators.
But behind the scenes,
these queens
stepped up their game
and started doing each other.
- Nicole Paige Brooks
from Atlanta, Georgia.
- "Nicole Paige Brooks
from Atlanta, Georgia."
- [laughs]
- [mocking laugh]
- I hot glued it to my leg
along with these to my arm.
- "Tyra, can you pass over
that hot glue gun, please?
"I'm fixing to glue
some rhinestones
onto my gown that
I'm trying to fix and make."
- I'm doing Sasha Fierce,
but technically,
I'm doing Beyoncé.
- "I love Beyoncé."
- As drag queens,
we make our own families,
but when the girls talked
about their real families,
the emotions ranged
from admiration
to something more complicated.
- "Dear son,
this is your mommy speaking.
"You're a very talented child,
and you could be
whatever you want."
She wrote me a note once before
when I was competing
for something
when I was, like, 20,
and I've kept it.
"So remember, if you don't do
what you're trying to,
I'll be behind you
with my belt."
- So your mom
said she's gon' beat you
if you don't make it?
- Yeah, basically.
- Damn.
- I'm really fortunate,
because a lot of people
don't have that family base,
you know?
Especially in our community.
And I'm just lucky to have a mom
that's so supportive
and I love very much.
- My father's one
of the toughest Scotsmen.
Like, he's a man's man,
you know?
And he was so okay
with me being gay.
He was like, "I love you.
It doesn't really matter
as long as you're happy."
And I was like, "Bizzle."
- To each his own.
- Absolutely.
- Like, when people
find out you're gay
and they're like,
"You know God loves you,"
yeah, I know he does.
Imagine what the world
would look like
if there weren't gay people.
Eww.
- I loved hearing
all the girls' backgrounds.
But Jujubee's sense of history
was positively Shakespearean.
- Did you guys know
the word "drag" is an acronym
that Shakespeare created?
- "Dress resembling a girl."
- It was actually a side note
for his plays,
because back in the day,
the players of the stage
were all men.
- They were ladyboys.
- One thing there was
no shortage of was girl talk.
- Whoo!
- Think it was gay pride
last year or something.
I got a taxi, and we go home.
I was, like, in drag in bed
like, "Come on, baby.
Let's do it."
[chuckles]
And he's like, "No!
You're Sahara!"
- Well, and people ask him,
you know,
if we have sex when I'm in drag
and all that stuff, so...
- There's ever been a night
where you're just messy drunk?
And you're just like,
"I don't want to take this off.
Let's just do it."
- No.
- Now, you know I love
a good catchphrase.
The time has come...
for you to lip-synch...
for your life.
Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best woman win.
And don't fuck It up.
But this season,
I had some serious competition.
- Work.
- Work.
- You better work, bitch.
- I'm not a bitch.
I'm America's sweetheart.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
- Thank you.
- Are you going through it?
Are you going through
some psychological changes
in your life?
- I'm not.
- I'm not either.
- Now, I know you're
a two piece and a biscuit.
- As long as that two piece
and a biscuit is there,
I am perfectly happy.
- [laughs]
- I got my two piece
and a biscuit
waiting on me anywhere I go.
- During my worldwide tour,
I stopped in Texas,
and I did meet mystique,
and she wanted to be tipped
with a two piece and a biscuit.
- Two piece and a biscuit.
Mystique gone but not forgotten.
[laughter and applause]
Now, it's been
an incredible season...
What do the bags say?
They say "Santino"?
[laughter]
Dripping with charisma,
uniqueness, nerve,
and talent.
- Marker.
- Welcome to another--
Oh, shit.
- And I'm not just talking
about the queens.
I'm talking about the judges.
Sassy Santino
and our resident fashionista,
Merle Ginsberg,
not to mention our star-studded
panel of guest judges.
- That, to me,
was a complete turn-on.
- [gasps]
- Kathy, did you know Jessica
was padded?
- I am too actually.
- Okay.
- Yeah, I've been padded
for the last ten years.
[laughter]
- The judges brought a lot
of life experience to the show,
and the contestants
were all ears.
- You must not listen
to the interviewer.
If he says,
"Where are you from?"
you say, "Well, actually,
I'm from so-and-so,
but in my book,"
and then you name the book.
You always have to bring it in
yourself,
'cause they're never
gonna bring it in.
- I started working
in a strip club,
like, with the regular girls.
You could walk into the club,
and you could find
that there was one girl
everyone was trying to be like,
and they're all doing
the same thing,
so it doesn't make
financial sense.
- So your lip sync
was very, very good too,
which I noticed right away,
because in films,
that's what we always did.
It's not easy
to lip-synch correctly,
and you did a super job.
- In the real world,
if you get arrested
and don't speak English,
the court
appoints a interpreter.
But here on<i> RuPaul's Drag Race,</i>
language barriers
are just part of the fun.
Did you tuck your candy?
Did you hide your candy?
- My candy?
- Yes.
Um,<i> como...</i>
-<i> Huevos.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
-<i> Huevos el pollo?</i>
- Oh, my--this?
- Something with Angela
at the end.
- Everyone has a problem
with my name.
- I was gonna say Kangela.
I'll change mine to Kangela.
- 'Cause a lot of kids
are calling you Shan-gella.
- Or Shanga-linga.
She called her
Shanga-linga.
- I do have an ointment
in my dressing room for that.
Yeah, you know,
a lot of the judges
mentioned Tyra's deep voice.
- When you transform into Tyra,
why doesn't your voice change?
- In fact, Santino
didn't just mention it.
He worked it.
- [in deep voice]
I think that Tyra should stay,
but sometimes when I see her
and she's talking to me,
I just think, "Who is this dude
talking to me?"
- [laughs]
- I'll give you $4,000
to stop that right now.
- Right, right, me too.
Now, most queens aren't shy,
but this is a family show.
So you have to use
a little discretion.
And nothing says discretion
like a double entendre.
- Anybody that's eating
my cherry pie
raves about it.
- How's the crust?
- Crispy
and a little tender
in the middle.
- And the fruit?
- Always ripe.
- Is it juicy, Pandora?
- It's overflowing with juices.
- Would you say your cherry pie
was succulent?
- I would say it's succulent
and a bit moist.
- Oh.
- [laughing]
You getting hungry, Kim?
- I'm getting hungry.
- Now, for some queens,
the ultimate praise is when
people think you're a real girl.
- It's really a woman,
isn't it?
- It is really a woman.
- I knew it.
I knew it.
- It's called being fishy.
- When you walked out,
I really did have
that same moment that Dita had.
Is that a girl?
I think that's a girl.
There's an imposter in the show.
It's a girl.
Check her crotch.
- Well, maybe we have
a real scandal here.
Maybe she's actually
a real woman.
- What?
- Ever thought about that?
- I will walk off this set.
- I will kick her ass.
- I was give her a pap smear
in five seconds,
and I will get
to the bottom of it.
- This season, we not only
dished celebrities.
We ate 'em for lunch.
- I mean, I love everything.
I'm gonna be the Paula tonight,
I think.
I'm the Paula
of the RuPaul show.
- I know a number
of big Hollywood moguls
who would like to take you out
if you ever--
if you're ever available.
[laughter]
- I really like Lady Gaga
a lot.
She's almost like
a drag queen herself.
- Almost?
You're very kind.
You actually did more work than
Britney does in her concert.
I mean, you actually sang
in your concert,
which is something
Britney does not do.
- I like that wig.
It looked good.
You know, I really did see--
Leslie Stahl
has a good wig as well.
Leslie, I'm so sorry.
- At the end of the day,
I hope I'm less of a judge
and more of a teacher.
And the best way to teach,
of course, is by example.
Earlier today, I had my face
lifted for a fifth time.
Why?
Because I'm dedicated to this,
children.
You are a burning sensation,
and I don't want an ointment
to clear it up.
You have to use what you've got
to get what you want.
You know, my friends call me
the MacGyver of drag.
I will take a wire hanger and...
- A Maxi Pad.
- And jimmy-rig
a lighting system
in a hotel room.
- What happens sometimes
is that my nuts pop,
and it reminds me
that I'm a dude.
- [laughs]
- So I try to go right back
to being feminine,
so that's what happens.
- Yeah, I mean, I know--
everybody knows
about popping a cherry,
but nobody talks
about popping a nut.
- No.
- It is part of doing drag.
So in case you missed
any of the fierce action...
- You pushed me!
You pushed me!
- Here's a fast-forward
flashback
of this season's competition.
- Cheeseburger, Taco Bell,
and a Diet Coke on the side,
girl.
- On the first day,
the Gone with the Window
photo shoot
tested the queens' ability
to get real,
to get glamour,
and get blown.
- I've never been blown
like that in my life.
[laughter]
- Then everybody had to channel
their inner Scarlett O'Hara
and style an outfit
from a set of curtains.
Morgan McMichaels,
you are the winner
of this challenge.
Mystique, based on your
unforgettable presentation,
I'm giving you
a "get out of jail free" card.
Sahara Davenport, shante,
you stay.
Shangela, sashay away.
Next, we divided the queens into
two teams of burlesque dancers,
and each team had to work hard
for the money...
[cheers and applause]
Then take to the streets
and represent.
- You got some money for me?
- Does anybody want
cherry pie gift certificates?
- Help me out.
Buy some pie.
- Be soprano, though,
when you talk, girl.
- Hi. Would you like to buy
a slice of cherry pie?
- In the end, Sahara won,
and Raven
and Nicole Paige Brooks
had to lip-synch
for their lives.
Nicole Paige Brooks,
you are a fabulous queen.
Now sashay away.
Next, the girls
had to shoot a commercial
for Disco Extra
Greasy Shortening.
- Hi.
Welcome to another
home-fried meal.
- Wait, can you stop?
Can we cut?
Can you--
is it home-fried male?
- Is it home-fried male?
- Home-fried meal.
- Meal. okay.
Thought she was
gonna fry up a boy.
- On the main stage,
the girls turned it out
in front of country legend
Tanya Tucker.
- Wow.
Awesome.
- Tyra stepped up her game
with three outfits in one.
Tyra Sanchez, you tore it up,
Miss Thing.
And it was Mystique's turn
to, well, split.
[laughter and applause]
- Next, we asked the girls
to channel
their best celebrity
impersonations
for a little quiz show
we call<i> The Snatch Game.</i>
- I'm so--
I'm a little embarrassed, Ru.
- Are you embarrassed?
- I'm a little embarrassed.
'Cause I just wrote, "I've got
a lovely bunch of coconuts."
[laughter]
- Britney,
Dumb Dee Dee's so dumb,
last night, she got arrested
for driving without a...
- A baby in her lap.
- A baby...
[laughter]
Tatiana took the prize,
and Sonique bent over backwards
to try and stay in the game...
when she and Morgan
had to lip-synch
for their lives.
This choice
has never been so difficult.
Sonique...
sashay away.
For the next challenge,
we asked the girls
to customize wedding dresses.
And Tyra's "singing"
and her hot glue gun
got on everybody's nerves.
- [off-key singing]
Ah, shh...
- Keep burning yourself,
bitch.
- Ah!
- But on the main stage,
the judges went all
Lady Gaga over Tyra's look.
- You look like
a porcelain doll...
- Thank you.
- With the makeup, I love it.
- Tyra Sanchez,
congratulations.
You're the winner
of this challenge.
When it came time
to lip-synch for your life,
Sahara was really
on her toes.
And poor Morgan
got left at the altar.
- For the next challenge,
the guest judge Henry Rollins
joined Terri Nunn,
and the whole house was rockin'.
- Ah!
- You know what,
Eddie Murphy?
- Ah!
- You cannot have this,
ladygirl, honey.
- Jessica won,
so Jujubee and Sahara
had to lip-synch
for their lives.
[sultry music]
- Sahara Davenport...
sashay away.
When the girls regroup,
they hit the books to create
their own autobiography.
- It's so exciting to be a part
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
It's almost as exciting
as my new book<i> Out of the Box.</i>
- The book is called
<i>The Woman in Me.</i>
- I just got finished
writing a memoir,
and I call it
<i>Memoirs of a Gay-sha.</i>
- I have my new book.
- What was that?
- The name is<i> Jessica Wild:</i>
<i>The dreams of a Golden Child.</i>
- Well, first of all, I'm
<i>Young, Broke, and Fabulous.</i>
My new book is going
to hit stores soon.
- In the end, Raven was
the hands-down best seller.
Raven, you're young, broke,
and fabulous.
Tatiana and Jessica Wild had
to lip-synch for their lives.
And it was the closing chapter
for Jessica.
- Thank you from
the bottom of my heart.
- So the next challenge
had the girls working
with some gay pioneers
from the Stonewall era.
- Which one of you bitches
is my drag mother?
- Whoa, Jesus.
- I thought maybe you'd do
something interesting with it,
like a low cut.
I put in all this stuff
for today.
- And these silver foxes
turned into golden girls.
- Oh, dear.
[laughing]
- And in the end, Raven
carried herself to victory.
Yay!
[applause]
Pandora, you opened your box
for the world to see.
Now sashay away.
[laughing and applause]
Next, the girls were nominated
for the first annual Diva Award.
[women vocalizing]
all: Bitch.
- On the main stage,
the girls served
some serious mean teen fashions,
dished up some extreme D.C.
executive realness,
and gave Hollywood's
red carpet beauties
a run for their money.
- I feel wonderful, fabulous,
gorgeous, beautiful.
- Gorgeous.
- In the end, Tyra outdiva-ed
the other divas.
Tatianna, you made
this competition fun and fresh.
For that,
I have just two words.
Thank you.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
And then there were three.
all: Amen.
- In just one week,
Raven, Tyra, or Jujubee
will walk away with the title
of America's
next drag superstar.
The winner will also receive
a lifetime supply
of NYX cosmetics
and be the face
of nyxcosmetics.com,
an exclusive
one-year PR contract
with the leading LGBT firm
Project Publicity,
be featured in l.a.Eyeworks'
legendary
designer eyewear campaign,
and headline
Logo's Drag Race Tour,
featuring exceptional
Absolut drinks,
and a cash prize of $25,000.
If you think
you know these divas,
think again.
Because behind
the fabulous dances
and fierce facades,
there's a whole lot of heart
and soul
you've never seen until now.
When first we saw Jujubee's
audition tape...
- Hi,<i> RuPaul Drag Race,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
my name is Airline.
- We were wowed
by her transformation.
[gasps]
Jujubee.
- And do you have anything
you want to say
to your fans out there?
- I just want to say thank you
for all the years that
you have been supporting me.
- Sweet and bubbly
to feisty and fierce.
- And you!
Legendary you think you are.
Legendary
looks like leg and dairy.
- Oh-ho-ho!
- Jujubee wasn't afraid
to share some of the pain
from her past.
Where do you get your sense
of humor from?
- My father passing away
when I was 15.
- 15?
- Yeah, and from then on,
it was just, like,
you know, I can't be stuck
in this little ball.
- Right.
- And I can't, you know,
cry about it anymore.
He was like my king.
He did everything for me,
he taught me everything I knew,
he knew that I was gay
before I knew I was gay.
He dragged me to school
every morning,
and the last thing
he would always say
before I left the car was,
"And don't let those kids
tell you anything different."
He's like, "I know
what they say about you.
You can do
whatever you want to do."
And--and that's what I'm doing.
- But Jujubee's
positive attitude
is positively infectious.
- I have the full package.
I have personality,
I have sense of style,
and I have great big,
white teeth.
- I thought she was dynamite.
She had a fantastic personality.
- I'm already happy
about just being here.
But if I win,
everybody gets a puppy.
- Our next finalist
is the other Tyra--
the beautiful, the gorgeous,
the alluring Tyra Sanchez.
- During my transformation,
when I start feeling like Tyra,
it's backstage,
putting on the makeup.
But it all comes into place
when I hear them say...
- Tyra Sanchez.
- Hear that crowd screaming.
And then once that music starts,
my heart stops for probably,
like, a split second.
And it starts beating again,
but it's not my heart
at that point.
It's Tyra's heart
that's beating.
- Tyra.
Ah.
- It's kind of Rita Hayworth.
- It's very Rita Hayworth.
<i>Gilda.</i>
- Yes,<i> Gilda.</i>
- Tyra had to overcome a lot
to achieve what she had.
- I grew up in probably, like,
every project in Orlando.
Like, at the end
of every school year
someone got shot or murdered.
- And in real life,
this hot drag mama
is a young dad.
- I do have a son.
- Jeremiah.
Oh, that's the tattoo you have.
- Yeah.
My son makes me smile
every time I see him.
My son is my motivation
to keep going,
to make his life better.
- You know a family that
drags together stays together.
I would love to be
America's next drag superstar
to, like, inspire more people
to, like, let them know
that they can do it too.
- Raven is a Southern California
girl down to her roots.
- You guys need look no longer,
because the best queens
are in Southern California.
- Raven!
Oh, darling!
- I love doing drag
because I love
the transformation.
I love being able to transform
from a guy into a girl
and then at the end of the night
being able to take it off.
- Raven!
- I definitely do not want
to be a girl.
I love myself, who I am.
It is an art form.
- Now, Raven
landed in the bottom two
early in the competition...
Raven...
I'm sorry, but you're up
for elimination.
But proved she had the stuff
to make it to the final three.
- Why should you win
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race?</i>
- Well, first of all, I'm<i> </i>
<i>Young, Broke, and Fabulous.</i>
If I were to win
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
it will help to show people
that drag's cool,
'cause it's fucking cool.
Drag's cool.
- Well, there you have it,
the fabulous final three.
And if you've been groovin'
to any of my songs this season,
you can find them all
on my album<i> Champion,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
available on iTunes.
Or read my book<i> Workin' It!</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
on sale everywhere.
Join me next week
for the grand finale
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i>
to find out who will be crowned
America's next drag superstar.
But most importantly,
remember,
if you can't love yourself,
how in the hell are you gonna
buy my album and my book?
All right,
now let the music play.


- Previously on
<i>Rupaul's Drag Race...</i>
- The weakest person
in the group is Tatianna.
- No.
- My mom sent me
to a military school
in hopes that she would
get a little soldier.
Needless to say,
she got a drag queen.
- I think I could sell ice
to an Eskimo.
But not dressed as a fucking
Chicken.
Cock-a-doodle do!
- Tyra Sanchez, you tore it up,
miss thing.
Congratulations.
You're the winner of this
challenge.
Raven, I'm sorry, but you're up
for elimination.
You've been down this road
twice...
but you keep pulling through.
Shante.
You stay.
- Thank you.
- Mystique, sashay away.
[laughs and applauds]
And tonight...
hey, squirrel-friends.
Tempers flare...
- I almost just jumped out
this chair at your ass.
- You don't know Beyoncé
personally.
- Are you talking to me?
- And you'll be seeing double.
Rupaul!
Hey, Rupaul!
- Oh, hello, darling.
[laughter]
- With extra special
guest judges
Niecy Nash and Lisa Rinna.
The winner of<i> Rupaul's Drag Race</i>
will receive a lifetime supply
of Nyx cosmetics and be the face
of nyxcosmetics.com...
an exclusive one-year PR
contract with the leading
LGBT firm Project Publicity...
be featured in L.A. Eyeworks's
legendary designer eyewear
campaign
and headline Logo's
Drag Race tour
featuring exceptional
Absolut drinks...
and a cash prize of $25,000.
And may the best woman win.
[electronic pop music]
[alarm clock beeps]
- Oh, Mystique.
- Wow.
Her lipstick is chunky.
- Is that cake icing
or lipstick?
- No, if it was cake icing,
she would have eaten it off.
- Oh, that's cruel.
- Bye-bye, shablam.
- When Raven
wiped the mirror off,
it was almost like
a cleansing for the room.
Like, a new day.
- I don't know,
I feel bad for her.
- Well, we knew from day one
that she was going home soon.
Shit rolls downhill.
- Sonique, she always got that
stink face.
And if she is talking,
it's usually
she's talking mad shit
about people.
- You know, karma is a bitch,
and I think you just get what
you give.
- I just don't feel like she was
this big, horrible thing
that everyone, you know,
has the right
to talk such shit about.
- I pity her.
I don't feel bad for her at all.
- I don't think she needs to be
pitied though.
"She doesn't need your
pity, bitch."
I pity you for the face
that you have.
- I just don't want to have to
lip-sync for my life again.
I don't.
- You better work, bitch.
- I don't want to.
I'm gonna be devastated
if I have to lip-sync
for my life again.
Two weeks on the bottom
is not good.
I won't do it again.
[siren wails]
- Ooh, girl!
- You got she-mail.
Good morning, racers.
Sincerity is everything.
And if you can fake that,
you got it made.
Play the game right and you're
gonna leave here
with a whole lot more
than a trash compactor
and a lifetime supply
of turtle wax.
You could snatch the title of
America's next drag superstar.
And please remember to always
spay and neuter your pets.
[laughs]
- You know, there's so many
things that I don't know.
- Hello, hello, hello.
[applause]
Attention, drag race shoppers.
The pit crew and I just got back
from stimulating the economy.
Because for today's
mini challenge,
we're gonna play...
In this game,
you'll have to guess
the correct prices of some
drag queen essentials.
There's gonna be three rounds,
and the winner of each round
will advance
to Rupaul's showcase throwdown.
Now since you've been here,
none of you have been able
to contact anyone
from the outside,
but that's about to change.
The big winner of the final
showcase throwdown
will get the chance
to phone home.
- The first thing that pops
into my mind is,
"I'm going to call Chris."
My boyfriend, you know?
I miss him so much.
- All right, ladies.
Are you ready to play
The Queen is Right?
[cheers and applause]
Raven!
- Whoo!
- Swish on down, mommy.
Jujubee!
[laughter]
Sahara Davenport!
[cheering and laughter]
Okay.
Are you queens ready?
- Yes!
- Our first item,
a six-pack of tube socks.
Who needs surgery when you can
stuff your way from flat
to double D?
Raven, what is your guess?
- $9.45.
- Jujubee, what is your guess?
- $5.98.
- Sahara's writing down
her price.
Sahara is guessing--
- $6.00.
- Now, Sahara,
you cock-blocked Jujubee.
- Yes, she did.
- The correct price is...
$10.99.
- Yay, yeah!
- Congratulations, Raven.
- I won something!
- The Queen is Right!
- Winning that made me
feel great.
Like, okay, these bitches
better watch out.
- Our next item...
hemorrhoid cream.
A best-kept beauty secret
to decrease under-eye puffiness
for any queen recovering
from a hard day's night.
Pandora Boxx,
how much do you believe
this hemorrhoid cream
is worth?
- Rupaul, I'm gonna go with
$2.98.
- Jessica Wild?
- It's a cream that I don't
know for what it is.
$4.50.
- Morgan McMichaels?
- $5.85.
- The correct price is...
$5.59.
Congratulations, Jessica Wild.
The Queen is Right!
[applause]
- If I have the opportunity,
I am going to call my mom,
because more than just a mom,
she's my best friend.
- Our next item...
a roll of duct tape.
Not only used for tucking
your tender parts,
but also an essential
for any aspiring
MacGyver of drags.
Tyra, what's your guess?
- $2.98.
- Al right, Sonique?
- I'm gonna say $4.00.
- All right, Tatianna?
- $3.75.
- The correct price is...
$6.98.
Sonique is the winner!
Congratulations, Sonique.
The Queen is Right!
[applause]
- Sonique ended up winning.
Boo.
- All right, ladies,
here we go.
Our showcase throwdown
is designed
for a lady-boy night
on the town.
Starting with a pair of genuine
brass knuckles.
Now what lady-boy
night on the town
would be complete without
a can of...
With its own cute little
carrying case.
Perfect for the drag queen
on the go.
And finally, a brand-new wig!
And not just any wig,
but a lace front wig
made of real human hair
courtesy of Wig Pro Collections.
Now you need to bid
what you think
all three of these items cost.
Whoever comes closest
without going over
will win the total package.
Let's start with Sonique.
- $225.01.
- Jessica?
- $390.
- Raven, it's come down to you.
- I'm going with $395.
- The correct price is...
$1,283.90.
Raven, you are the winner!
- Yeah!
- Yes!
- Raven, you get
the whole package
and a phone call home to mama.
- Yes!
I'm excited to get to call
my mom.
I don't need the wig.
I don't need the pepper spray.
But calling my mom is golden
to me.
- It's time for your
main challenge.
This week, you'll be guest stars
on a game show
I like to call
Snatch Game.
And in the great tradition
of drag,
you'll be asked to appear
doing your best
celebrity impersonations.
- Wow.
That is fierce.
- You'll be judged on your
look, precision, and wit.
And it really helps if you can
make us laugh.
So, gentlemen, start your
engines
and may the best
Liza, terrific win.
[laughs]
[applause]
[phone trilling]
- Hello?
- Mom?
My biggest inspiration for drag
is my mom.
Mom.
- [indistinct]
- Mother?
- Hello?
- Hello, mom.
- Oh, hi.
- How are you?
My mother is the most perfect
person in the world.
And how's church?
- It's fantastic.
Been praying for you every
night, so--
and every day.
- I love you.
Give my love to everyone.
- I will.
Okay, bye-bye.
- Bye.
Being able to talk to her,
it brought me to a place
where I feel confident again.
Mom can always do that.
- So who does everybody think
they're going to impersonate?
Who?
- Who do you--
- I'm doing Beyoncé, so...
- I'm gonna be Bey.
Beyonce is sort of just like me.
Well, I basically have my look
together, I think.
- They didn't give us much time
for this one.
- I know, right?
- I actually have never
impersonated a celebrity before.
So, Jessica...
- Yes?
- Who do you usually, um, do?
- I always perform as myself,
you know, Jessica Wild.
- Same with me.
I just do Tatianna.
Tatianna is the character.
I was like,
"What am I going to do?"
- Our main challenge is the
Snatch Game,
and Rupaul told us to dress up
like our
celebrity impersonations
and get ready to
make people laugh.
Sonique, what made you decide
to do Gaga instead of Madonna?
- I don't have a madonna.
- You look like her.
You could borrow
from every girl.
I guarantee you would
find something.
- My first choice, of course,
would be Pink.
- I'm doing Pink.
Pink is my number one character.
I love her, and I do
a really good, you know,
illusion of it.
- I mean, I love Pink,
but I don't need to do her
every time I go on stage.
- Are you talking to me?
- Yes.
- I did not hear
a word you said.
- I base Sonique off of Pink.
That whole rocker kind of image.
I just--I really like Lady Gaga,
and I want to go for that.
- You better work it out, girl.
- Hello, hello, hello!
- Hi.
- Hey, squirrel-friends.
- Hello.
- Got a nut for another
squirrel-friend?
- There's plenty of nuts to go
around, babe.
- [chuckles]
I bet.
So, Morgan, who are you?
Who have you chosen as your
celebrity impersonation?
- I have chosen Pink
as my celebrity.
She's, like,
the number one for me.
- How would you describe
Pink's personality?
- She stands up
for good things.
Like, she uses her celebrity
for, you know,
PETA and against
animal cruelty
and things like that,
so, you know?
- Well, PETA's sort of a tough
joke to sell in Snatch Game.
- But she's funny.
- I trust you have a plan.
Sonique-ka-nika-nika-nika.
Who are you doing?
- I want to do Lady Gaga.
- Lady Gaga?
- I love her.
- You know, I was on the fence
about her
until she did that
interview where they said,
"What are you looking for
in a boyfriend?"
and she said...
"A big cock."
- [chuckles]
It'll be really easy for me
to channel Lady Gaga
'cause I'll say
what's on my mind
and hopefully
it'll make you laugh.
- [chuckles]
All right, Sonique.
I expect to be gagging
on your Gaga.
Tatianna, now,
who are you gonna be?
- I think I'm doing Britney.
- Britney Spears.
- What does Britney do?
- [smacks gum]
- Chew gum?
- Mm-hmm.
- Ahh.
She does this thing with her--
she'll go...like that,
which is really--
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
That's it! That's it!
Are we gonna see that?
- Sure. Absolutely.
- Okay.
- And some hair flips?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.
- I want to know who left
my hair out here?
- Me.
I'm gonna be the supermodel
of the world Rupaul.
- [laughs]
You little thief.
Eve Harrington.
Trying to steal my show,
are you?
- [laughs]
- What are some of the
signature Rupaul things?
- You open your eyes like this.
- That's usually a sign
that I have gas, actually.
Now some people would say it's
kind of risky
to do an impersonation
of a person
who's gonna be in the room
with you.
- Yes.
I know, but I can say,
"I did Rupaul
in front of Rupaul."
And you're going to have a lot
of fun
looking that Latina
making you.
- All right, go back to work.
- Yeah, you better work, bitch.
- Pandora Boxx.
Come over here, girl.
I wanna talk to you.
- Okay.
I'm gonna be Carol Channing.
- Carol Channing?
- Carol Channing.
- [dramatic gasp]
Yay!
Thank you, Jesus!
Thank you!
"Corn?
I don't remember eating corn."
- [laughing]
- Are you doing<i> Hello, Dolly!</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
Carol?
Are you doing<i> Love Boat</i><span style="bodyStyle"> Carol?</i>
Are you doing "raspberries!"?
- I think I'm doing kind of
like the raspberries era,
because I don't have the big,
crazy glasses.
So, you know,
you can't do, like,
modern Carol without those huge,
like--
- Right.
- Like, saucer glasses.
- Yes.
Thank you, miss channing.
- Thank you.
- Look how gorgeous!
My goodness, the blending.
- Yes, girl.
- It's severe up in here.
Who are you doing?
- I'm gonna do Paris Hilton.
- Why'd you choose her?
- She's fun to make fun of.
- Yes.
Now you've been up for
elimination twice.
- I'm over it.
- You are over it.
- I don't wanna do it again.
- So you're putting
all your eggs
in Paris Hilton's big basket.
- Yes.
I'm trying.
We'll see what happens.
- All right.
Good luck, Paris.
- Thank you.
- All right, I'm gonna scoot
around over here.
Ooh, how "purdy".
And who are you doing today?
- I'm doing Sasha Fierce,
but technically
I'm doing Beyoncé.
- Now, Santino mentioned
the other day
that you should
work on your voice.
- When he said it, I thought
that maybe--
maybe he's right.
If it's a beautiful person,
it should be, like,
a beautiful voice with it.
- Listen, you know, your voice
worked
for Bea Arthur
and Weezy Jefferson.
All right, Tyra.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
- Sahara Davenport.
- Hey, girl, hey.
- Hi, mommy.
- How are you?
- I'm doing great.
- Good, good, good.
- Who are you impersonating?
- Whitney Houston.
- Whitney!
Now, are you gonna be<i> Being</i>
<i>Bobby Brown</i><span style="bodyStyle"> Whitney Houston,</i>
or are you gonna be Clive Davis'
Whitney Houston?
- I think<i> Being Bobby Brown's</i>
Whitney is a little more fun.
- [laughing]
Bobby Christina!
- Bobby!
- [laughing]
- Well, I'm so glad that
Whitney's back,
and she's on our show.
- [laughing]
Word, so am i.
- Hey, Jujubee.
- Hi, momma.
- Are you preparing for your
Snatch Game?
- Yes, I am.
- Who are you impersonating?
- Kimora Lee.
- You're doing Kimora Lee?
What is she like?
- She's a business woman,
she's a supermodel,
she's a mommy.
So she's kind of like
a chameleon.
- Where do you get your
sense of humor from?
- My father passing away.
You never know when somebody's
gonna leave you.
So you treat every day
like it's your last day.
Amd you just give the best that
you can give, you know?
- And that's why
the sense of humor?
- Yeah, of course.
Why not?
- All right,
you get back to work.
I can't wait to see your
Kimora Lee.
- I can't wait either, girl.
- [laughing]
All right, ladies, the Snatch
Game is about to begin.
Now, this is your opportunity
to steal the spotlight.
Ham it up and make us laugh.
Now the queen with the best
celebrity charisma, uniqueness,
nerve, and talent will win
the challenge.
Oh, and one other thing...
don't fuck it up.
All right, I'll see you all
later, good luck.
all: Bye.
- Bye.
What do I need to do first?
I need to tuck my hoo-hoo away.
I decided I was going to emulate
Britney Spears,
but I had no
idea what I was going to wear.
- What wig are you wearing?
- That one.
Blonde wavy, and then I'm gonna
put a fedora on top of it.
- The wig she was wearing was
just, like, three hairs.
- I have a better blonde wig
if you wanna use it.
It's just fuller.
- It's fuller?
- Yeah.
- Whatever works, definitely.
Thank you.
Morgan, surprisingly enough,
let me borrow one of her wigs.
Is this what you use
for your Britney?
- No, I left my Britney wig
at home.
- I think it might've come
from the fact
that she didn't think
I was going to be a threat.
So might as well let her--
you know, throw her a bone.
Yeah?
Cool.
I think Morgan needs to be
knocked off her high horse,
and I think that that will
happen with this challenge.
Yay!
[laughing]
[applause]
- Hello, everybody!
Welcome to an all-star edition
of Snatch Game 2010.
I'm your host Rupaul.
Let's get to know our
contestants.
She's an actress, model,
and a red carpet favorite.
Phoebe Price is here.
Hello, Phoebe.
- Thank you.
Thank you for having me.
- He's a talented actor,
comedian, and housewife.
Welcome<i> Ugly Betty's</i><span style="bodyStyle"> Alec Mapa.</i>
Hey, Alec.
- Hi, Ru.
This is a master class in
staying in character.
When you see a really good
queen do it,
you realize that
the clothing and the wig
is the last thing
that has anything to do
with bringing forth
the essence of this person.
- Let's say hello to our
fabulous celebrity panel.
First up, Carol Channing
is here.
- It's great to be here,
wherever I am.
- [laughing]
- All right, next up
we have Pink.
Hey, Pink.
- Rock and roll, baby.
- Now, I've never seen you on
a game show before.
Is this your first one?
- This is my first--well,
it's not my first one,
but it's my
first game show.
- Kimora Lee Simmons.
Now I know that you're not
Simmons anymore.
- We don't wanna talk
about that.
- You don't wanna talk
about that.
- It's personal.
- Up next we have Lady Gaga.
Look at your poker face,
darling.
- Trust.
- We have Rupaul.
Hey, Rupaul, how are you?
Rupaul?
Miss Rupaul?
- Oh, hello, darling!
- [laughing]
- How are you?
[laughing]
How are you?
I said I'm going to do Rupaul.
And I'm going to have fun,
and I hope Rupaul will have fun
with my character, too.
- Oh, boy, you look gorgeous.
- Rupaul is very professional
when she's in drag.
Rupaul doesn't just get up
and start walking
and running and singing.
- All right, Paris Hilton
is here.
You have a line of clothing,
you have perfumes,
you have shoes.
- I didn't know that I had
shoes out there.
- Yes, you do.
She's made a big comeback,
Whitney Houston is here.
- I'm so excited to be with all
these lovely divas.
Yes, ma'am.
But let's not forget,
I am the original diva.
- Yes, you are.
Give her a big round
of applause.
- Thank you.
I love you much.
I love you much.
- Whitney's back.
- Ha!
- All right, next to Whitney,
of course...
Britney Spears is here!
- Hey, y'all.
- So happy to have you
on the show.
What's your favorite game?
- Oh, goodness, I like playing
hide the cucumber.
I love that one.
- Oh, yes, one of my
favorites too.
- I always win.
- Next to Britney,
we have Sasha Fierce,
a.k.a. Beyoncé
is in the house.
Hey, Sasha.
- Hi, how are you?
Beyonce's just like me.
All I have to do is
just be myself,
like, just smile,
say nice things--
thank you for having me.
- Tyra is really lucky that she
has immunity this week.
Because her Beyoncé
was not Beyoncé.
It was Tyra talking.
- Here's how the game works.
I'll ask a series of questions,
the celebrities will fill in
the blanks,
and you'll give an answer that
you think will match theirs.
All right, Phoebe,
are you ready to play?
- I'm ready.
- Okay, here we go.
Fat Fanny, the drag queen
is so fat
instead of dollars she prefers
to be tipped with blank.
- Well, I know in the South it
would be pork rinds.
So I would have to say
pork rinds.
- Pork rinds,
that's a good answer.
- She wants to be tipped with
pork rinds.
She's fat, right?
Carol Channing?
- Bingo.
[laughing]
Did I win?
- No, you didn't win.
Actually, we may want to see
your answer.
What did you fill in
the blank with?
Well, I said turkey legs.
- Turkey legs!
She's close.
Pink, what'd you say?
- Well, you know, like, I went
to Britney's concert,
and it's just, like, you know,
a drag show.
So I--and I tipped her
with slices of lunchmeat.
- Slices of lunchmeat.
Good answer.
- Paris Hilton,
you have pork rinds?
- No, I don't know too many
fat people.
- Oh, okay,I see.
- So I don't know what they
like to eat or be tipped with,
but I would think that
they would want something
that could fit
in their tight clothing...
- Yes, of course.
- And that they could eat.
So I put beef jerky.
- Beef jerky.
- When I was fat...
- Yeah?
- Kevin liked to tip me in
what he liked to call
his man butter.
- Man butter!
- Mm-hmm, it was really good.
- Sasha Fierce, what do you have
for Fat Fanny,
the drag queen?
What'd she like to be
tipped with?
- Well, ru, I never met
Fat Fanny,
but during my worldwide tour
I stopped in Texas,
and I did meet Mystique.
- Uh-huh.
- And she wanted to be tipped
with a two-piece and a biscuit.
- Two-piece and a biscuit.
Mystique gone but not forgotten.
[cheers and applause]
Okay, you ready for
the next question, Alec?
- Yes, I am.
- Okay.
Slutty Sally is so slutty,
last time I took a ride on
her disco stick, I got blank.
- I'm gonna cast a wide net here
and say the last time I
took a ride on her disco stick,
I got an STD.
- What do you think Slutty
Sally gave to people
with her disco stick?
- Scurvy.
- Scurvy.
Scurvy, yeah.
- I'm the national spokesperson
for Broadway Actresses
Against Scurvy.
- [laughing]
- We deliver limes and lemons
to all the people around
in the neighborhood.
And raspberries.
- And raspberries.
Is that a deterrent for scurvy,
raspberries?
- Well, they tell me it is.
I don't really know anything
except what they tell me,
you know.
Carol Channing,
hysterically funny.
I love that she was completely
out of it the entire time.
- Let's go to Kimora Lee
and see what she says.
- Scabies.
- Scabies is not sexually
transmitted, is it?
- It can be, I've had it.
- [laughing]
- Let's go to Lady Gaga.
- Yes.
- Last time I took a ride on
her disco stick, I got...
- Money, honey.
- Lady Gaga, I didn't really
feel like
there was any
characteristic "Gaga-ish-ness".
- Okay, Rupaul--is Rupaul
asleep down there?
Is she okay?
Do we--seriously, is she okay--
oh, she's okay.
- The time has come now for you
to lip-sync for your life!
- [laughing]
- To impersonate somebody
who's standing
ten feet from you
takes gigantic balls.
- She got shoes
from the disco stick.
From Whitney to Britney.
Slutty Sally is so slutty,
last time I took a ride on her
disco stick, I got...
- I got lost.
- You got lost?
- I got lost.
[laughing]
Am I wrong?
- Britney...
eerily accurate.
Kinda spooky.
- Thank you.
- All right, darling.
Dumb deedee is so dumb,
last night she got arrested
for driving without a blank.
- Let's go to Phoebe price
here, Phoebe price?
- I would have to say driving
without a car.
- Driving without a car.
- I've done that before.
- Where did you go?
- I don't even--
I was just driving around,
and then I realized, like,
I'm walking, y'all.
[laughter]
I'm walking.
- When one queen gets laughs,
everybody scrambles to get just
as many laughs,
but I think once
the scrambling began,
they lost the plot of the game.
- I'm a little embarrassed, Ru.
- Are you embarrassed?
- I'm a little embarrassed,
'cause I just wrote,
"I've got a lovely bunch
of coconuts".
[laughing]
- Great minds think alike.
I said car.
- Thank you, girl!
- I broke you in, girl.
I broke you in.
- She looked like Pink,
and the clothes and the wig
and the makeup were hooked up,
but the mannerisms
weren't there for me.
- Wonderful, okay.
Lady Gaga.
Well, my first answer
was spaceship.
- Uh-huh.
- But the one I put down
was car.
- Two points!
Paris Hilton.
- Well, because you're so hot,
I knew that we would get this
right so I said car, too.
- Car!
[applause]
Wonderful!
- The voice wasn't even close
to being Paris Hilton.
- Britney, Dumb Deedee's so
dumb last night she got arrested
for driving without a...
- A baby in her lap.
- A baby...
[laughing]
- Because every time I do it,
I don't get arrested.
- Yes, that's right.
- Dumb.
- Before I say my answer,
can I say one thing?
- Yes.
- To Britney and Whitney.
- Yes.
- Because I love them much.
Whitney, you're such an
inspiration to me.
- I love you too, baby girl.
- But I notice
they keep twitching.
And I know that they're
survivors,
but the only way
they're gonna keep survivin'
if they stop sniffin'
these markers next to them.
- Am I the only one
who's doin' it?
- Uh, I--apparently.
- It smells like home.
[laughing]
- So right now, the score
stands at five for Alec,
three for Phoebe.
Alec has won this game.
- Thanks, stars!
Thank you, ladies.
Thank you.
- All right, until then
we love you,
keep coming back
on Snatch Game 2010.
All right, stars,
see you next time.
- I'll be really surprised
to see
who's in the bottom two
tomorrow.
Yeah, it'll be
a sleepless night.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Good morning,
morning glories.
- It's lip-sync day.
- Here goes.
- Who feel like they're gonna
be on the bottom tonight?
- Just as long as it's not me.
- The bottom is not bad.
[laughing]
- I do wish all of you luck.
Can you win a challenge
two weeks in a row?
- Do you think you're gonna win
two weeks in a row?
- I'm praying I do.
- I don't know why Tyra
was asking
if anyone's ever won
two challenges in a row.
Because she's totally
not gonna win.
- What did you guys think
about me?
- Picking Beyoncé's
a difficult thing to pick.
Like, because she's not
that funny.
- But I don't think Britney
is funny,
but you made her funny.
- No, Britney is funny.
- But there are a lot of things
that B does
that are funny to me.
- The only thing she's done
funny is fall.
- Well, that's funny to you
and that's crude.
And like, I almost just jumped
out this chair at your ass.
That was insulting to Beyoncé.
This is something that she may
have been embarrassed about.
- You gotta get over this whole
Beyoncé thing.
- No, just drop it, please
just drop it, girl.
- Beyoncé fell,
and it was funny.
It tickled me pink.
- I thought it was funny, too.
- It was funny!
You don't know Beyoncé
personally.
- Tyra, she believes
that she's Beyoncé.
And she doesn't wanna hurt
Beyoncé's feelings,
because somehow Beyoncé
pays her bills.
- Well, we'll see
on the main stage.
I'm just gonna shut up.
- [laughing]
[applause]
- Hello, hello.
Santino, how are you?
- Ru, I'm great, how are you?
- Are you jealous of my boogie?
- I am so jealous.
- Today you are just
boogielicious.
- [laughing]
Niecy Nash, thank you for
joining us.
- Thank you for having me.
And thank you for letting me
have that flower!
[laughing]
- Lisa Rinna.
- Hello.
- You are gorgeous.
- Oh, no, you are.
Stop it. Thank you.
- This week, the ladies
were challenged
to a celebrity impersonation.
Tonight, I asked them
to knock us out
with their own
personal style.
Judges, are you ready
for what's coming?
- Ready!
- Oh, yeah.
- Gentlemen,
start your engines.
And may the best woman win.
Pandora Boxx...
- I'm feeling really good
about the choice I made
with the dress.
I'm listening to what
all the judges have said,
and I'm trying to incorporate
that into my runway.
- She's like
a hollywood starlet
looking for a casting couch.
Tyra sanchez,
ladies and gentlemen.
It's the other Tyra.
- What recession?
[laughter]
- The concept of my costume,
I was thinking,
for a rich, couture woman,
and she has endless
amounts of money.
- Just buried the husband.
- And out spending his money.
- What do the bags say?
They say "Santino."
[laughter]
Oh, my god.
Santino, I didn't know you had
a boutique.
Okay, Morgan McMichaels.
Oh, honey, the circus
is in town.
- My personal style
is funky and fun,
and, you know,
drag is a circus,
and I want to be the director.
- It's the greatest show
on earth, Morgan McMichaels.
Jujubee.
Or should I say Lil' Kim?
- I feel like I'm
a superhero diva,
and my power is glitter.
- Is that Lil' Kim
or Lil' Kimchi?
Yes.
- Wow.
- Oh.
Sonique's in the house,
ladies and gentlemen.
Julie Newmar,
eat your heart out.
- My style was dominatrix,
feline, sex kitten.
- Faster pussycat, kill, kill.
Tatianna Porizkova.
- As I'm walking further down
the runway,
I'm noticing that my skirt
is rising and rising
and rising.
- Honey, if that skirt
were any shorter,
we'd have to arrest you
for dealing crack.
Jessica Wild.
Puerto Rico, okay.
- I feel great.
I feel very good.
I'm very happy with my outfit.
- She gonna party like
it's 1999, hunty.
High fashion.
Parisian.
- Ohh.
- Don't go out and blend in
with the rest of them.
Every time you go out there,
look your best.
Don't save something for later
because you may not have later.
- Ooh, yes, honey.
- These ruffles have not
any ridges.
- No, I bet you can't take
just one bite.
Ooh, girl!
Sahara Davenport.
What will people say?
- I'm feeling very powerful
and strong.
They need to see
this side of me.
- Little Grace Jones.
- Yes, gorgeous.
Ladies, your fate
is in your hands.
Inside there's either
a heel or no heel.
If it's a heel,
you can walk away safe.
No heel, and you stay,
which means you're one of
the best or worst of the week.
Tyra Sanchez, heel or no heel?
She's got a heel.
Congratulations, you're safe.
- Thank you.
- You may join Sasha Fierce
backstage with the dancers.
Tatianna.
No heel.
You stay.
Raven.
- Please just let there be
a fucking heel in this briefcase
so I can leave the stage.
- Heel.
- Yes! Thank you, Jesus!
[laughter]
- Jujubee.
No heel.
Jessica Wild.
Heel.
Sahara Davenport.
Heel.
Sonique.
No heel.
Pandora Boxx.
No heel.
Morgan McMichaels.
No heel.
You stay.
The five of you represent
the top and bottom of the week.
It's time for
the judges' critique.
Jujubee, the challenge
yesterday, you were Kimora Lee.
- I think I would have liked to
have seen you to be even bigger.
- We don't want to
talk about that.
- You don't want to talk
about that?
- It's personal.
- When you do characters,
and you only have
a short amount of time,
you want to do the biggest thing
about them
that makes people go,
"That's Kimora."
- Thank you, Jujubee.
Sonique, yesterday you portrayed
Lady Gaga.
- I think what Lady Gaga
was missing was comedy.
- Trust.
I didn't want to embarrass
my character.
It's all about the fashion.
I focused a lot
on the way I looked.
- I want you to come out
from behind the mask.
I feel like you might be hiding
a little bit.
- Would you like me
to take my mask off?
- Would you, please?
Can we see?
- Ladies and gentlemen,
Sonique.
- There we go, okay.
- Yay!
- There's a lot of fabulousness
in there,
and I think we just need to see
more of it.
- All right, Sonique,
thank you.
Pandora Boxx.
- Hello.
- I think you give great camp,
because instead of doing camp
that's, like, cheesy,
you do camp that's funny.
- I just wrote "I've got
a lovely bunch of coconuts."
[laughter]
- I think you nailed it.
You so nailed it, girl.
I just think you own it.
- Thank you.
- Tatianna.
How do you think you did on
the Snatch Game?
- I felt really proud
of myself.
- Last time I took a ride
on her disco stick, I got...
- I got lost.
- She used to live around
the corner from us,
and so I saw her a lot,
and you nailed her.
- I think you've got
a million-dollar face
and a $5 million body,
and you've got a $20 outfit on.
But I want to see more charm
and less hooker.
- Morgan McMichaels.
Tell me about your Pink
during snatch game.
Now, I've never seen you
on a game show before.
Is this your first one?
- This is my first--
it's not my first one,
but it's my first
game show.
- Your Pink,
I didn't necessarily get.
I think you could have been
way more obvious,
way more butch.
- It wasn't very effervescent.
- I felt like it went over
like a fart in a space suit.
And it was a risk.
And I knew by doing Pink,
I would be here.
- Thank you, ladies.
While you wait in the
Interior Illusions lounge,
the judges and I
will deliberate.
Thank you, ladies.
This is the time when we have
to break this shit down.
Sonique, I was not gagging over
her Lady Gaga.
- Yeah.
- Even if we don't know
who Lady Gaga is.
She could have done anything.
Make something up.
- Great on the pole dancing.
Like, unbelievable.
- When she hit the pole,
she was on fire.
She has to take that
pole performance
and put it in her
Lady Gaga.
She has to be more out there.
Tatianna.
- She needs to go home
and read 20<i> Vogues</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
and get back to us.
- Her Britney was amazing.
- Oh, the Britney, genius.
Her Britney blew me away.
I think it was
the best character
on the Snatch panel.
- Pandora Boxx.
- Pandora Boxx has got
great comedic timing.
I don't love her personal style.
I mean, it's almost easier
for her
to play a character than
be herself as Pandora Boxx.
It's not all, like, linking up.
- She's a drag queen
for Christ's sake.
She giving us lightness
and comedy and old movie star,
and I think she does it
really well.
- Okay.
Morgan McMichaels.
Her Pink impersonation was not
very strong.
- She did say that she knew
that she may have that problem
with not being able to go for it
because of her reverence.
Now, if this is a competition,
and you're trying to win,
you need to take a risk,
but that's the wrong risk
to take.
- Jujubee.
- She was not in the most
fabulous outfit.
Merle, I'm surprised you didn't
pick her apart.
- I would have if it was
on somebody else,
but something
about her comedy
and her wink-wink, nudge-nudge.
- Let's talk about her
performance as Kimora.
- As a comedian, that makeup
on her neck--what?
- That was a good detail.
- You know, the performance
could have just been okay,
but that attention to detail--
- Yes, and it's those
little things
that make a character
come to life.
- It's so true.
- Okay, silence.
I've made my decision.
Bring back my girls.
Welcome back, ladies.
I've made some decisions.
Pandora Boxx, you delivered
another standout performance,
but you were overshadowed
by one of your competitors.
You're safe.
You may join the other girls.
Tatianna, you may have looked
a little cheap on the runway,
but in the challenge
you displayed a level of
confidence and professionalism
that is worthy of the next
drag superstar.
Congratulations, you're
the winner of this challenge.
[applause]
- Thank you.
Thank you so much.
- You've won immunity
for next week,
plus a $1,000 shopping spree
from billiondollarbabes.com.
- It's just validating.
I really am meant to be here,
and there really is something
special in me.
- Congratulations, Tatianna.
You earned this one.
- Thank you so much.
[sniffling]
- Sonique,
you're a beautiful doll,
but we were not gagging
on the eleganza of your Gaga.
It was a risky choice and one
that did not pay off.
I'm sorry, my dear,
you're up for elimination.
- Being in the bottom was just
so fucking nerve-racking.
- Morgan McMichaels,
you were pretty in pink.
- Thank you.
- But your performance left us
a little blue.
You're up for elimination.
- First time in the bottom two
sucks.
I knew I was going to be there,
and I knew I deserved
to be there.
- Jujubee, I've saved you
for last,
because I want to light
a fire under you.
You keep landing in the middle
of the pack.
Turn up the heat,
or you could go down in flames.
- I won't.
- You are safe.
Please join the other girls.
Two queens stand before me.
I've consulted with the judges,
but the final decision is mine
to make.
This is your last chance
to impress me
and save yourselves
from elimination.
The time has come for you to
lip-sync for your life.
And remember, good luck
and don't fuck it up.
[music begins]
- I was telling myself,
"You're gonna have to do
whatever it takes to get you
out of this hole."
- It's a lip-syncing
competition.
It's not a gymnastics
competition.
- Wow.
- Wow, ladies.
Whoo-hoo!
- Sonique, Morgan McMichaels,
you both approached this with
two completely different styles.
Morgan, the precision of your
lip-sync
was one of the tightest
we've ever seen.
Sonique, you pulled out
all the stops
and worked every inch
of this stage.
This choice has never been
so difficult.
But I've made my decision.
Morgan McMichaels.
- Yes?
- Shante, you stay.
- Thank you.
- Sonique, sashay away.
[applause]
- I guess the hardest part of
this whole contest
was trying to find
the beauty in yourself.
Maybe I shoulda just stopped
being so serious.
There's more to life than just
being better than everyone,
and I definitely feel
more humble now.
- Ladies, you're all-stars,
but only one of you can be
the next drag superstar.
Remember,
if you can't love yourself,
how in the hell are
you gonna love somebody else?
Can I get an amen in here?
all: Amen.
- All right,
let the music play.- Previously on
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race....</i>
You'll be launching
your very own dragazine.
- Sex sells, people, sex sells.
- Ha ha.
I'm a successful drag queen.
I'm not like some club queen
who has to show for a dollar.
- You have to spot me.
- That looks like a man.
I look like Sharon in that one.
- Ouch.
- Your dragazine cover
is possibly the worst one.
I hate the font.
- Me too.
- The eyes scare me.
- They're my trademark.
- It creeps me out.
- Phi Phi O'Hara,
you are the winner
of this week's challenge.
- [laughs]
Ah, finally!
- Willam, shante, you stay.
Jiggly Caliente--
may I call you Jiggly?
- Yes.
- Sashay away.
And tonight, you'll be competing
as a couple...
of frenemies.
The jig is up.
If Phi Phi O'Hara was the last
ladyboy on earth,
would you kai kai with her?
And a shocking twist...
- [vomiting]
- It's really not cute.
- With extra-special
guest judges
Pamela Anderson
and Jennifer Tilly.
[cheers and applause]
The winner of
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i>
will receive a lifetime supply

featuring Absolut vodka--
cocktails perfected--
and a cash prize of $100,000.
And may the best woman win.
[tires squealing]
Walking in today
to Jiggly being gone
is obviously mind-boggling,
'cause there's only
six people left.
- [singing]
- Yo, that's a lot of lipstick.
- "To my bitches, love you all
to death, Jiggly Caliente."
At least the lipstick's
on the mirror
and not on her teeth for once.
Bye, girl, bye.
That was my first time
in the bottom two.
I wasn't happy to be up there,
and I know I was trying
to be pretty at least.
- Did it humble you?
- It didn't add
any humility to me.
- Humble pie is what
Willam should be.
If it was anybody else
other than Jiggly,
she would have went home
last night.
- Girl, you were so pissy
and fussy up there, girl.
Ooh!
- Any way to keep
my dress moving
and to keep me
sparkling a little bit.
- Mew mew doesn't make
talent, honey.
- My last performance
wasn't my best,
but it was enough
to keep me here.
- You girls told me to take
those damn white contacts
out of my eyes before Runway,
and I didn't.
I said I wanted 'em.
They looked pretty.
And they totally got me.
So now I have to, like, serve up
some girly-girl nonsense.
- Like, can you leave your
gothic and your vampire,
like, that type of look aside,
and just do, like,
glamorous, pretty?
- But I think I am glamorous.
Can I do a lemming look?
Sure, I can throw myself
off of a cliff with you,
but I don't want to.
I am no longer justifying
my personal beauty
to these girls.
No one remembers the girl with
the tan skin and the blond hair.
They remember the girl coughing
up blood with white eyes.
- What I read in my makeup
and everything,
I want the judges to know
that I am listening
and I want to be here--
- You did a great job.
- And I want to take
all their critiques in.
- Like, standing next to you
when you won,
you, like, kind of
threw your head back
and I saw, like,
the square sideburn.
- Oh, picking straws, dude.
- Hold on, I'm still
complimenting you
in your appearance
that was like--
- That's, like,
a backhanded compliment.
I'm tired of her
and I want her to go home.
I thought it looked gorgeous,
and if I can rock a sideburns
and win a challenge,
then I'm gonna rock a sideburn
and win a challenge.
They liked it.
- Everybody want Willam
to go home.
She is completely annoying.
- Well, congratulations, whore.
- Yeah.
- Phi Phi.
- Two challenges ago,
I was in the bottom three,
and now I'm in the top.
- So, Phi Phi,
what took you so long?
[alarm wails]
- Ooh!
- Girl, you've got shemail.
<i>You know, there are two things</i>
<i>I don't like about you.</i>
<i>What?</i>
<i>Your face.</i>
<i>[gasps]</i>
<i>Ladies, keep your friends close</i>
<i>and you frenemies even closer,</i>
<i>'cause in this competition,</i>
<i>even the mirror has two faces.</i>
<i>Yeah, and one of 'em is</i>
<i>cracked.</i>
<i>Shut up!</i>
<i>Oh, you shut up!</i>
<i>I'm not listening to you.</i>
<i>La la la la la la la.</i>
<i>Bitch, I'll be waiting for</i>
<i>your ass in the parking lot.</i>
<i>Bitch.</i>
[laughter]
Hello, hello, hello.
- Hi, Ru!
- RuPaul!
- Ladies, in a competition,
people can say one thing
to your face
and then talk smack
behind your back.
Sometimes it's hard to know
who your real friends are.
For today's mini challenge,
I'm not looking
for a winner or a loser.
I'm looking for the truth,
and you can't handle
the truth, girl.
One by one,
you'll be hooked
to a lie detector,
a little lady go by the name
of "Polly Graph."
Know her?
I thought you did.
- I'm worried she's gonna ask me
some questions
I don't want to answer.
- Time to spill it, girls.
[laughter]
Welcome, darling.
Now, I'm going to ask you
a series of questions.
You answer each
with a simple yes or a no.
Is that clear?
- Yes.
- John, are you all set?
- I am.
- Are you now
or have you ever been
a biological woman?
- No.
- Have you ever worn
women's clothing?
- Yes.
- Do you sleep in the nude?
- No.
- Just as I suspected.
- If Sharon Needles were
the last ladyboy on earth,
would you kai kai with her?
- No.
- If Phi Phi O'Hara was
the last ladyboy on earth,
would you kai kai with her?
- Yes.
- If Willam were the last
ladyboy on earth,
would you kai kai with her?
- No.
- If Latrice were the last
ladyboy on earth,
would you kai kai with her?
- Yes.
- Yes.
- Yes.
- Interesting.
[beeping]
Do you think Willam
is prettier than you?
- Yes.
- No.
- No.
- Have you ever talked shade
behind Chad Michaels' back?
- No.
- Do you think you could win
a lip-sync for your life
against Sharon Needles?
- Yes.
- Have you ever lied
about your age?
- Yes.
- Fascinating.
- Do you think Willam
is annoying?
- Yes.
- Have you ever
looked at the pit crew
with lust in your heart?
- No.
- No.
- Yes.
- Do you like my line
of iron fist shoes?
- Yes.
- Yes.
- Yes.
- Last question:
Are you the future of drag?
- Yes.
- Yes.
- Yes.
- Your questioning is over.
I will supply the FBI with
a copy of your transcripts.
Ladies, the results are in.
In addition to the truth,
your answers revealed to me
a lot about your different
personality types.
Now, I've arranged you
in two lines.
Look at the queen directly
across from you.
That's the person you have
the least in common with,
someone you might not even
like very much,
but that queen possesses skills
and traits you don't have,
and in a crisis,
she could save your ass.
That means, Dida Ritz, you're
paired with Chad Michaels.
Willam, you're paired
with Latrice Royale.
- Oh, evil.
- Phi Phi O'Hara, you're paired
with Sharon Needles.
- Party City.
- Busted showgirl.
- For this week's
main challenge,
you need to put together
a nightclub act
sponsored by NYX cosmetics,
and you'll be competing
as a couple...
of frenemies.
Now, each pair will create
costumes, choreography,
and specialty lyrics
to the original song,
<i>Better Than You.</i>
Oh, and tomorrow
on the main stage,
you'll be singing it live...
- What?
[laughs] What?
- No lip-syncing.
- I don't sing live, boo-boo.
There's a reason
why I lip-sync.
- In the tradition
of famous frenemies
like Joan Crawford
and Bette Davis.
Time to make nice,
girls, or just fake it,
you know,
like I'm always doing.
[laughter]
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.
See ya.
[laughs]
- Bye, Ru.
- Bye.
- O-m-g.
- Have you listened to it yet?
- No.
- It seems like the mindset
amongst the queens is that
you're only as good
as your last performance,
but I'm a singer,
I have a band,
and I plan to win
this challenge,
and I want to prove that I'm
not just some lip-syncing queen.
I think it's kind of
natural too,
because my voice is probably
an octave higher
than yours,
so it'll sound good.
- [laughs]
Okay.
- Why don't we do,
like, the elphaba--
like, a<i> Wicked</i><span style="bodyStyle"> thing.</i>
- Ooh, I like devil and angel.
It's better,
and it's how people see us.
- I'm not sure how Phi Phi and
Sharon are gonna work together.
They're the most opposite,
and they've also had
a little tiff.
Should we rewind that back?
- Tired-ass showgirl.
Fuck you.
- "Tired-ass showgirl"?
At least I am a showgirl, bitch!
Go back to Party City,
where you belong!
- If the chemistry's not there,
then it shows through on stage.
- Okay.
- We can play off that
showgirl/Party City thing.
- We can just write
Party City/busted showgirl,
as who you are.
[laughs]
Busted showgirl,
which I'm sure you don't want
to say about yourself.
- The only thing I'm really
nervous about
on this challenge is,
I can't stand Sharon,
and that probably won't change.
- Do you want to call me
post-mortem glam
or Party City spook?
- I think
Party City spook is good,
'cause I don't want
to call you glamorous.
- I wouldn't consider
Phi Phi a frenemy.
I'd consider her an enemy.
- And that's it.
Shit.
- This challenge is so tough
because we basically have
to create a nightclub act,
and we're singing it live.
- Neither Dida nor myself sing,
and it was hard.
- We sound like two sick cats.
- I've been waiting
for this challenge,
because I love to sing, I've
been singing since I was little,
so we'll see how this goes.
- Hot mess.
Oh, my God. What?
- Hello, hello, hello.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- Hi, Ru.
- Chad Michaels and Dida Ritz.
So what's your plan?
- Well, our plan
is a classic sister act,
truly reading each other down
the Runway.
- Listen, there are
two other teams,
and you've got to have something
that's gonna stand out.
Dida, what do you think that
Chad has that you don't have?
- I have a bit more
of a kind of younger,
around the way
type of look with my drag.
- Chad, what about you?
What do you think that Dida has
that you don't?
- She's not afraid to,
you know,
fall on her face or to fail.
- I want to be surprised.
I want to be entertained.
Trust me,
they're coming for you.
- Thanks, RuPaul.
- All right.
- Thank you.
- Sharon Needles,
Phi Phi O'Hara, how's it going?
- I've been working
with my frenemy.
I guess it's going okay.
- Why do you think you two
were paired up?
- We kind of hate each other.
- Really?
A lot of co-stars don't
particularly like each other,
but somehow it creates
a sort of chemistry on-screen
that actually works.
Are either of you singers?
- I am.
- Yeah, we both
are kind of singers.
- Wow. All right, so do
a little preview act for me.
Okay. Ready?
- All right, so,
you want to do--
do you want to put our
choreography with it as well?
- Let's sing it right now.
- Okay, okay,
we'll just sing it,
'cause choreography,
we're working on real hard.
- Okay.
- I'm white, girl.
- Oh, dear.
- Ready? Here we go.
- Uh-huh.
- [off-key shouting]
- [off-key shouting]
- Wow, was that harmony there?
There's a lot of stuff
going on there.
- Sharon really wants to do
this, like, heavy metal voice,
and I'm like,
oh, hell no.
- I'm gonna let you
get back to work.
- Okay, thank you.
- Good, can't wait to show you.
I know I'm gonna do a good job.
Sharon better not fuck it up,
'cause I'm gonna be pissed.
- Willam and Latrice.
- Hello.
- Do either of you sing
in your acts?
- I regularly do.
Most of my act
is with a live band.
- Now, Latrice,
what do you think Willam has
that you don't have?
- When I first met
little Willam,
I was not featuring
her at all, right?
She was not the feature
presentation.
But I'm a quiet confident, where
she's very vocal about it.
- What does Latrice have
that you don't have?
- I would love to have
some of that quiet confidence
instead of my confidence
that some people mistake
for cockiness.
- I'm gonna help ground
Willam a little bit more.
We're gonna calm her down.
Pss-pss, pss-pss.
- Yeah.
- Let your work
speak for itself.
- So what is the gimmick
for your outfits?
- We're gonna be pretty in pink.
[laughs]
- Oh, pretty in pink.
Is that enough of a gimmick?
- Oh, I'm gonna turn her out.
- Oh, yeah?
- Basically,
she's gonna be a whore.
- You kids have your work
cut out for you.
I'm gonna let you
get back to it.
- Okeydoke.
- All right, wonderful.
- Fuck it, let's just do what
we want to do and do it well.
- [groans]
- All right, ladies,
gather around.
Later today, you'll have
a chance to work on your acts
with the composer
of<i> Better Than You,</i>
my songwriting partner
and producer Lucian Piane.
- Very cool.
- And tomorrow
on the main stage,
you'll be making your
NYX cosmetics nightclub debut
in front of our
extra-special guest judges,
the wonderful actress and
poker champion Jennifer Tilly.
- [gasps]
- Wow!
- I love Jennifer Tilly!
- Academy award nominee
Jennifer Tilly.
It doesn't get better than that.
- And the always fabulous
Pamela Anderson will be here.
- Shut up!
- Shut up!
[laughter]
- Honey, I grew up watching
Pamela Anderson.
She's sickening.
She's the blond bombshell.
- And you'll be judged
as a team.
That means one pair
will be the winner
and one pair will have
to lip-sync for their lives.
- Why?
RuPaul, why are you
doing this to us?
- All right, frenemies.
Good luck,
and don't fuck it up.
- Thanks, Ru.
- Bye, Ru.
- Bye, Ru.
- This is crazy.
The first time in history
we all have to lip-sync
against each other.
Like, that could be
an emotional lip-sync.
What do you guys think
about, like,
having to lip-sync against
your teammate?
- Uh, well, that's a wrench
in the program, but--
- I'm not making plans to do it.
- [laughs]
- If Willam and Latrice
get in the bottom together,
bye, Willam.
- Honey, 'cause Latrice
know how to buck.
- Girl, Latrice
is gonna wear her out.
- Phi Phi's rolling her eyes
and talking about me,
and everybody's
saying I suck,
but they can fuck themselves.
I mean, Phi Phi--
I feel like in her eyes
I'm only as good
as my last performance,
and she thinks I'm just,
like, worthless now.
- Well, what was her
last performance?
- She's never done anything.
- No.
- Her's seems to be
a lot of the,
"Up here, dumb character!"
Voice, voice voice!
That's all I'm seeing
right now.
- Our accessories
sell our dresses.
You know, we'll have halos
and devil horns, devil tail.
- Yeah. It just has to look
really showgirl-y.
- You know, Phi Phi just wants
things so "perfect."
And then they'll say,
"Ooh, your tutu's legs."
- The only thing with
a minidress I'm scared about
is that it's gonna rise up.
- Well, we don't do anything
upside down.
- I'm not gonna go on-stage
and get read
for having my panties show.
Like, that's why.
Sharon's look is never polished.
I just don't feel like her drag
should be even critiqued
side-by-side with mine.
This is stressing me out.
- Hi, I'm Willam.
- Latrice.
How are you?
- Hi, nice to meet you.
I'm Lucian.
- Lucian is RuPaul's producer.
Like, he's the man
behind the magic.
- So are you guys ready
to perform for me,
and then we'll
take it from there?
- Sure.
- We'll come out to here,
do the first lines.
We'll move on to the whole show,
and then on the,
"I'm so much better than,"
we'll start walking.
- Oh, I thought--
- You walk in with me.
What, what?
- Yeah, I thought we were gonna
do our lines as we walk.
- Oh, okay, that's even--
- 'Cause that--yeah.
- That's fine.
- I think that's better.
- Okay.
- Are you guys ready?
- We're ready.
- Cue playback.
- All right, make sure you say,
"I'm a legendary," and then--
- I'm a legendary.
- Yeah, just make it clear
that you're being interrupted.
- Okay, got you.
- Wait.
It's every man for themselves.
If Latrice misses a line,
I'm gonna steamroll through it
with my next line.
- To be late is to be left.
- Boom.
Yeah.
- I would just say, like,
the more, like, vindictive
you can be with each other--
- Oh, well,
we've got that going.
- Yeah, you almost had it.
I don't know what happened
right there.
- Can we do it again
from the top, please?
- Willam is scrambling,
and she's not in
the right head space.
If either one of us screws up,
we're both screwed.
- Do you have any notes for us,
like, other than--
- Yeah, you guys just have
to practice and practice.
- Thanks.
I know that, in his head,
Lucian is reading.
He's like, these bitches are
fucking my song up right now.
- A little rough
on some of the cues there.
If you don't get
the lines across
and you guys are just doing
physical comedy,
it'll be like, why did she
fall down on the stage?
Or why did this happen?
Really concentrate on the lyrics
and getting those down,
and then, like, have fun.
- There's a certain level
of expectation for me
because I've been in
the business for 20 years.
I don't want to look like an
idiot in front of America.
- Cue playback.
- Wait.
Ready?
- Chad and Dida seemed
a little less prepared.
They struggled a little bit
with the timing of the lyrics.
- Okay, okay.
In a performance like this,
you guys have really
got to, like, step it up.
- The stress point of
the rehearsal was vocalization.
You throw the choreography
in there with it,
it's getting a little hairy.
- We have a little work
to do here.
- Yeah, we need a little work.
Um, uh, I'm a--
I guess I'm a little confused
by the opera stuff.
- 'Cause I'm an angel,
and I want to do, like,
a Disney character type of look.
- And I'm a devil.
I'm supposed to scream one of
my, "I do it so much better."
- Okay.
- Like...
I do it so much better!
- Yeah, we'll see.
- And then back to our normal.
- Oh, okay. Okay.
But why don't we Run it again,
and you--you guys--
- Could we just sing--
just do it normal
with no gimmicks
or anything right now?
- Okay, okay.
I feel like you guys
are just trying to sing this
a little too much.
The vocals are upstaging
the lyrics.
You don't have to do the vocal
stuff a little bit.
- Don't Christina it out.
- Bitch, shut up.
That's fine.
We'll talk it.
- Let's just, like, go,
uh, through the end part.
- Fucking shit!
- Let's try that again.
- [groans]
Fucking shit!
Sharon has no rhythm,
and if our rhythm is off,
then the music's off,
and then our beats are off,
and then it's just
all gonna be off,
and I'm not gonna be
in the bottom two
because Sharon is off.
- It doesn't even
fully seem like
you're totally present
right now.
I don't even know what that is.
- There'll always be tension
between me and Phi Phi.
She's that squeaky princess
that just needs to be
whapped over the head
with a two-by-four.
- You guys have to bring
your A game.
- Down the rabbit hole, darling.
- No, you don't.
- It is showtime,
ladies and gentlemen!
We have to perform duets.
Not lip-syncing.
Not recorded in a studio.
Live, bitches.
- Do you notice that Willam
is low energy today?
- She seems really quiet, girl.
- Usually Willam
has these one-liners
that she just shoots out
and throws,
but she's not speaking
to anyone and...
she just doesn't
seem like herself.
- How are you feeling today?
You all right?
- What?
- You know, you feelin' okay?
- Um, yeah.
It has nothing to do with this.
- Nothin'?
I'm a little worried because
we're being judged as a couple.
This definitely could
affect our performance.
I think you seem really
distracted today.
- No, I'm not.
I'm fine.
Once--once the red light's on,
I'm there.
- Okay, all right.
- Don't worry.
- [clears throat]
- Wait, what?
- [laughs]
- I'm glad I wore double
deodorant today.
I'm just gonna
ham it up onstage.
When Ru says, "You guys are
the winner of this challenge"--
- I'll like you permanently
if we win this together.
- Yeah, we fumbled yesterday
on the Runway,
but we understand that this
is an important challenge,
so put all differences aside.
Let's win this challenge.
Oh, my god,
you're a showgirl now.
- Oh, my--
- You're like me!
- Phi Phi and Sharon,
surprisingly, are getting along.
Is this for real?
- Sharon is a showgirl!
- I'm just temporarily playing
the role of a Phi Phi.
I'm getting to like Phi Phi
a little more,
but now it's just
upgraded to hate.
[clatter]
- Who is slamming the fucking
counter while I'm doing liquid?
- Girl, the counter moves.
- No, someone just slammed
something shut twice.
- Well, everyone tiptoe
around Willam's liquid.
- Shut the fuck up.
- I miss my drag family
now so bad.
I work with
some of the weirdest,
most interesting performers,
I think, in America.
If we're not freaking 'em out,
we're not working it out.
That is just the name of the
game in the house of haunt.
- If we go too long without
seeing and talking
with each other,
we have a potluck dinner
at my house and everybody
comes over for drinks.
- I want to come over
to dinner at your house.
- Me too, bitch.
- Absolutely.
'Cause we cook
the house down, honey.
- I always thought
I was so fucking interesting
before I came here but, like,
your guys' lives sound
like so much more fun.
I haven't come
from a drag family
because I didn't come up
through the club system
like most people have.
I've been on TV most of my life
for the past ten years.
I am a little weak in the friend
department because of it.
- I can't believe
you don't have,
like, a strong drag family.
- No.
- I need them.
- I couldn't live without them.
- [laughs]
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, baby.
- Welcome to the main stage
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
It's my evil twin,
Michelle Visage.
- Yes, and a big
domo arigato to you.
- [laughs]
Lucian Piane,
my partner in crime.
- Hey, it's so good to see you.
- How are my girls?
- They're really amazing.
- Did you sleep
with any of them?
- Two of them.
- [laughs]
Jennifer Tilly.
You're looking
beautiful tonight.
- Well, thank you.
The monkey glands are working.
- [laughs]
And Pamela Anderson.
Hey, soul sister.
- I finally made it.
Thanks for having me.
You look gorgeous.
- This old thing.
- [laughs]
- This week,
the queens were challenged
to perform a duet
with their best frenemies.
Tonight, on the main stage,
they're gonna make their
live nightclub debut.
Are you ready
for some double trouble?
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.
First up, Latrice and Willam.
I feel good vibes
coming from this.
- Willam is in it to win it.
I'm in it to win it.
Let's do this damn thing.
- [laughs]
[laughter]
- Oh!
- [laughs]
- All the jokes land,
but any chance to be onstage
is a chance to shine.
- Whoo!
- [laughs]
- Whoo!
- Yeah!
- Phi Phi O'Hara
and Sharon Needles.
- I think she added
a teaspoon or two
of Christina "Agliera,"
but that's another matter.
- I could tell that the judges
looked a little bored.
I'm going to be so pissed if
this cheesy song and dance
number sends me out of here.
- Whoo!
- Chad Michaels, Dida Ritz.
- Hello, Dida, darling.
- Hello, Chad.
How are you?
- I'm a legend.
- Well, that's debatable.
- I never.
I could hear my voice
kind of shaking a little bit.
RuPaul is right in front of you.
Don't fuck it up!
- [gasps]
- But at least my face moves
when I frown.
- Oh! Skag!
- Oh!
- Oh!
Dida, you bitch! Oh!
[laughter]
- Thank you.
- Welcome, ladies.
This week, we asked you
to combine your strengths
and weaknesses to create
one dynamic duo,
so tonight,
you'll be judged as a couple.
First up, Willam
and Latrice Royale.
Tell us about your performance.
- She has definitely gotten me
out of my comfort zone
a little bit.
[laughter]
This is not exactly what
I would do normally,
but absolutely loving
that I'm showcasing
the curves and swerves
I represent for the big girls.
- [laughs]
Do you feel that this outfit
compromises your Christianity?
- Jesus is a biscuit,
and I let him sop me up, so--
- Yes!
[laughter]
- You guys look amazing.
I love the lingerie,
the stockings.
Your shoes are killer.
- Oh, they're Versace.
- And that pratfall.
I'm using that trick.
That was some Vegas shit.
- But sometimes too much shtick
can get in the way.
- You two were sort of
like a Laurel and Hardy
or a Jane Russell/Marilyn Monroe
sort of combination.
You're really different,
but you worked so well together
and I really enjoyed it.
- Thank you, ladies.
- I just have to say one thing.
- What's that?
-<i> America's Got Talent</i>
has nothing on this show.
- Uh, hear, hear.
- This is a great show,
and there's so much talent
on the stage,
it's fun to see.
- Thanks, Pamela.
- Next up, Chad Michaels
and Dida Ritz.
- Hi, Ru.
- Hi.
- So, Dida, who did it better?
- Uh...
- Just say it, bitch.
- I will say me.
- That's right.
[laughter]
- What about you, Chad?
- Of course, darling, it was me.
[laughter]
- Sorry.
- I was getting a cavity,
listening to you two.
[laughter]
It was so Roxie and Velma.
It was very<i> Chicago,</i>
which I love.
- Well, I feel a little
like Paula Abdul,
'cause I loved everything.
[laughter]
- Dida, sometimes when you get
really, really excited
and you're singing
and you have so much energy,
you kind of lose
a little bit of the vocals.
- I think the jokes may have
fallen a little flat
because you couldn't hear
what you were saying.
- Next up, Sharon Needles
and Phi Phi O'Hara.
How did it feel up there?
- Me and Phi Phi have had
some bad blood here.
I've always found it
kind of hard to be accepted
by glamorous pageant-y queens,
and I took a little bit
of that mindset
into this competition.
- Calling her a pageant queen,
is that a read?
- Sharon, you could learn
something from pageant queens.
You're not losing Sharon Needles
in this glam look.
- I love this hair.
- It's gorgeous on you.
- I should have
done this a long--
this is some country crock hair.
- I think you guys were great,
and you look a little Janice
Dickinson and you're me.
- That's what I was channeling.
- I loved it.
- When you came down
to the bottom of the stage,
I loved that you were
trying the harmonies,
but they're a little bit off.
- I do feel like the comedy
was underplayed.
I think you guys
should have been funnier.
- Y'all were almost too nice.
It's a frenemies type of thing.
You know, it's kind of like, uh,
you're cutting on each other.
It was hard to even hear
if there was any shade in there.
- Thank you, ladies.
While you untuck in
the Interior Illusions Lounge,
the judges and I
will deliberate.
You may leave the stage.
Just between us girls...
- [sighs]
- What do you think?
Willam and Latrice Royale.
- Latrice stepped out
of her comfort zone,
and it looked great.
Vocally, I thought Willam
could really sing.
I did love their shtick
that they did,
but it kind of
took over the song.
- A little less might have been
a little bit more in this case.
- Well, I thought that their act
was very polished.
I really liked the choreography.
I thought it was very smooth
and it was very worked out.
- Now, would you have them open
for you in Vegas?
- Yes!
Especially with that little--
that thing at the end,
when they threw the purse
and she tripped or whatever.
- Yeah, that was good.
- The pratfall was great.
- Chad Michaels and Dida Ritz,
the ingenue and the veteran.
- The duo felt a little lopsided
with Dida's energy
being over the top.
- She was so energized,
and that's a great thing,
but that can also be
detrimental sometimes.
The microphone was a bit close,
like she gonna swallow it.
- Now, is that a bad thing?
- [laughs]
Not normally.
- All right, let's move on
to Sharon Needles
and Phi Phi O'Hara,
the devil and the angel.
- They started with the
harmonies, and I was like,
oh, my God, I'm so impressed.
They're singing in harmo--uh-oh.
Oh.
[laughter]
- I loved their voices together,
but then, I'm tone deaf.
[laughter]
And I thought there
could have been used
a little more choreography
at the beginning,
but I have no rhythm, so--
- Oh!
[laughs]
- Yesterday, there was some
undercurrent of tension
between them and then, today,
they seemed like
they had their shtick together.
They knew exactly what they were
doing, but unfortunately,
their shtick
didn't have a lot of shtick.
- I did like their outfits.
I thought that the angel
and devil thing was a good idea,
but it didn't really deliver,
because you couldn't even tell
any jabs were being thrown.
- All right.
Silence.
I've made my decision.
Bring back my girls.
Welcome back, ladies.
Based on your frenemies
nightclub act
and your presentations
on the main stage,
I've made some decisions.
Now, you are all troupers,
but tonight,
one duo did it so much better.
The winner of this week's
main challenge is...
Willam and Latrice Royale.
[applause]
You each win a custom corset
skirt and brassiere
of versatilecorsets.Com.
- I didn't expect to win
this challenge.
I'm really glad I didn't let
my partner down.
It's pretty fucking cool.
- That leaves Chad and Dida,
and Phi Phi and Sharon.
- [groans]
- Ladies, it's come to
a point in the competition
where every decision
is a painful one.
Phi Phi O'Hara
and Sharon Needles...
- [vomiting]
I feel kind of, like,
gut bubbles,
and I feel really sick.
I didn't want
to make RuPaul wait.
I didn't want to make
any of the guest judges wait.
I'm sorry.
So I tried to throw up
off the stage.
- It's really not cute.
- Willam, are you okay
to continue?
All right.
Phi Phi O'Hara
and Sharon Needles,
you are up for elimination.
Chad Michaels, Dida Ritz,
you may join the other girls.
- I was nice to Sharon,
and it backfired.
You know what?
I'm done.
I'm not playing nice
with you anymore.
- Two queens stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me
and save yourselves
from elimination.
The time has come for you
to lip-sync for your life.
- I don't want to go home,
plain and simple.
- Good luck,
and don't fuck it up.
<i>- This is RuPaul.</i>
<i>- And this is Martha Wash.</i>
<i>- We are reporting</i>
<i>to you live...</i>
<i>- From our weather center.</i>
<i>Honey, just when</i>
<i>you thought it was safe</i>
<i>to go back outside...</i>
<i>both: Bam, the sequel!</i>
- Hey!
- Oh, crap.
My wig was hanging on
by one freakin' bobby pin.
I'm not keeping
that bitch on my head.
It might as well go.
It's in my way.
<i>- That's right, honey.</i>
- I've worked too hard
and I've gone too far
into this competition,
and I'm not gonna get kicked off
because of some showgirl
Barbie doll.
- I know how Phi Phi
dances and performs.
I was shocked to see
that Sharon is keeping up.
This is tough to watch,
because you don't know
who is gonna go home.
[cheers and applause]
- Ladies, I have made
my decision.
- I'm very fucking nervous.
It was my first time
having my fate
dangled in front of my face.
- Willam, will you please
step forward.
- What the hell is happening?
- Willam, you won tonight
because you are a beautiful
and talented queen,
but it has come to my attention
that you have broken the Rules--
Rules that are in place
to protect the fairness
of this competition.
Your actions have consequences,
and I'm afraid
you leave me no choice.
Willam, I have to ask you
to leave the competition
immediately.
Now, sashay away.
- I broke the Rules,
but I'm a big boy
dressed in big girl's clothes,
so regret's kind of like
a fool's game.
I can't change anything
that I did,
and there's no use spending
any time dwelling on it.
I stood on stage, sick,
with a 24-inch-waist,
and I'm proud of myself.
- Phi Phi O'Hara,
Sharon Needles,
in light of tonight's events,
you got lucky.
You are both safe.
Shante, you stay.
[applause]
You may join the other girls.
My fierce five, let this
be a warning to all of you,
in the race to become
America's next drag superstar,
sometimes a queen's worst enemy
can be herself.
Now remember,
if you can't love yourself,
how in the hell you gonna
love somebody else?
Can I get an amen up in here?
all: Amen.
- All right.
Now let the music play.


- Previously on<i> </i>
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race...</i>
You'll be competing as
a couple...of frenemies.
Shit.
I'm not gonna be in the bottom
two because Sharon is off.
- Oh!
- [laughing]
- Ow!
Dida, you bitch!
- Thank you.
- Condragulations,
Willam and Latrice Royale.
Phi Phi O'Hara
and Sharon Needles,
you are up for elimination.
Ladies, it's come to a point
in the competition
where every decision
is a painful one.
Willam, it has come
to my attention
that you have broken the rules.
Your actions have consequences.
Willam, I have to ask you
to leave the competition
immediately.
Sashay away.
And tonight...
the queens
hit the campaign trail...
It's time to make
some "herstory"...
And "Frock the Vote".
- I'm gonna fit the capitol
with an up-do.
Up...do.
- With extra-special
guest judges,
columnist Dan savage
and Absolut's Jeffrey Moran.
- [cheering]
- The winner of
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
will receive a lifetime supply
of NYX cosmetics,
a one-of-a-kind trip
courtesy of ALandCHUCK.travel,
headline Logo's Drag Race Tour
featuring Absolut Vodka--
cocktails perfected--
and a cash prize of $100,000.
And may the best woman win.
- Ohh.
Cluck, cluck, top five.
- Top five, bitches, top five.
- Good morning.
- It's a good day,
because Willam is gone,<i> </i>
<i>finally</i><span style="bodyStyle"> gone,</i>
and I'm so excited.
- What is that?
- "I showed my ass a lot,
so here's one for the road."
- That is her ass.
- Ewww!
- That's nasty.
She showed that she was an ass.
- Yeah.
Willam broke the rules,
so bye, boo, bye.
- Good-bye, shady bearded lady!
- [cheering]
- Whoo!
Good-bye, shady bearded lady.
- Y'all are crazy.
- Fuck that bitch.
- I feel bad for Willam.
It's a really bummer
the way it ended for him.
- All right, Willam.
I mean, this is the only advice
I can give you
in your drag career.
[all laughing]
- Shave it.
- Shave your face!
- I got to admit, though,
I'm kind of jealous.
There's nothing more punk rock
than being kicked off.
- No, bitch.
No, no, no.
Not off<i> RuPaul's Drag Race,</i>
bitch.
That was the walk of shame,
bitch.
- Yeah.
- No shade, no tea, you guys.
Like, seriously, could you
believe that shit happened?
For once in my life,
I'm speechless.
No one's ever been kicked off
in the history of
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
I'm gagged.
- When RuPaul came out,
it was like this.
- Hold on, hold on,
we can do this.
I'll be Willam, you be Ru.
All right, I'll be Willam.
- [laughing]
- [imitating RuPaul]
I've consulted with the judges.
- Blech!
- But the final decision
is up to me.
- Blech!
- [all laughing]
- Phi Phi O'Hara,
Sharon Needles,
you're both safe.
Sharon, you were better,
but you're both safe.
- Blech!
- [all laughing]
- You are fucking evil.
[siren wails]
- Ooh, girl!
- Speak of the devil.
- You've got shemail.
Attention all teabaggers.
- Uh!
- Read my lips.
According to a recent
stripper poll,
America's next drag superstar
needs to pull herself up
by her bra straps,
stand tall in her platforms,
and be the life of every party.
'Cause honey,
nobody likes an empty box.
- No, ma'am.
- I'm RuPaul, and I don't
approve this message.
[engine zooms]
- Stripper poll?
- Hello, hello, hello!
- [all greeting]
- Ladies, America's
next drag superstar
has to stand for something,
or she'll fall for anything.
Now, for today's mini-challenge,
you need to stand tall
by decorating a pair
of platform shoes.
Take them from plain to par-tay.
To provide you
with some inspiration,
please help me welcome
Absolut Vodka guru
Jeffrey Moran.
[clapping]
- Hey, Ru.
Gentlemen.
What you see here before you
are some great classic cocktails
that will be the inspiration
for today's challenge.
At Absolut,
we've been celebrating
the gay and lesbian community
for 30-plus years.
So you can imagine we've thrown
some really great parties.
- Dida Ritz, your inspiration
is an Absolut Collins.
Latrice Royale, Absolut Punch.
Phi Phi O'Hara,
Absolut Grapevine.
Sharon Needles,
Absolut Berri Sour.
Chad Michaels,
Absolut Greyhound.
- Love it. Thank you.
- Okay, ladies,
you'll have 20 minutes
to create platforms that look
good enough to drink.
Ready, set...
go.
- You got the good stuff.
- You don't even know
what you're talking about.
- Oh, man, this is not sticking.
- Jiggly, quit
complaining over there.
- [scoffs]
Needles.
- What?
- What are you doing?
- What the fuck
does it look like I'm doing?
- How's it going for you?
- Oh, fine.
I had all the accessories
I needed
to convey the plight
of the American Indians.
Though I wish I had
some poker chips.
- Ow!
- All right, ladies, time's up.
Let's see your platforms.
First up, Dida Ritz.
- I was inspired by the
Victorian age,
so I took from Marie Antoinette,
and she's a big woman
on shopping and shoes.
She would want a fierce pair
of shoes like this.
- Sort of if Marie Antoinette
were a stripper.
- She would wear these.
I know she would.
- Latrice Royale.
Absolut Punch platforms.
- Well, my shoes are inspired
by the nightclub.
That's where everybody's
getting their party on
and their drink on.
And you might see a girl
hanging from the ceiling,
wearing these shoes.
- Oh.
Next up, Phi Phi O'Hara.
Absolut Grapevine platforms.
- You know I'm designing for
your new iron fist line, right?
- Oh, wonderful.
- Yeah.
I really wanted to take you to,
like, an exotic
vacation hot spot.
Like for all those, you know,
women that are at home,
they can just put on their shoes
and have a cocktail,
and bam, they're on vacation.
- [chuckles]
All right, next up,
Sharon Needles.
- My Berri Sour platforms
are inspired by red rocks
of the southwestern America,
and I'm serving you
some Navajo realness.
And we have these
dream catchers in the back.
I prefer nightmare catchers,
but these do the trick.
- These are platform shoes
for the real "nava-hos".
- [cackling]
- I thought we were
supposed to design a shoe,
not just slab on a piece of fur.
- May I see
the dessert platter next?
- Um, yes.
Let me get you a dessert.
Are you guys good on coffee?
- Good on coffee right now.
- Good on coffee? Yeah.
- Everything tasting all right?
- Yeah.
- Next up, Chad Michaels.
- This is for the girl on the go
on New Year's Eve to wear,
and she's got her Greyhound
in the foot to go.
- Oh, now, what makes that
Greyhound in the foot?
- That's grapefruit juice.
- Of course. Okay.
- Absolutely.
Need a little vitamin C.
You don't want scurvy, you know.
- No, no, not again.
I'll never go
through that again.
- [chuckles]
- Ladies, you all stepped it up,
but one of you really walked
all over the competition.
The winner of today's
mini-challenge is...
Phi Phi O'Hara.
- Yeah! Hot dog.
- Condragulations, Phi Phi.
I am head over heels
for those shoes right there.
And thank you, Jeffrey Moran.
- Of course, anytime.
- We will see you tomorrow
on the main stage.
- Look forward to it.
Good luck.
- Bye. Thank you.
- Speaking of platforms,
I want to find out
what America's
next drag superstar
really stands for.
And this being an election year,
it's time to make
some "herstory".
I, RuPaul,
would like to announce
the candidacy
of Phi Phi O'Hara, Dida Ritz,
Sharon Needles, Latrice Royale,
and Chad Michaels
to become the first
drag president
of the United States of America.
For this week's main challenge,
you'll face the nation
in a "Frock the Vote"
presidential debate.
This is your chance to prove
that you have the kind of
charisma, uniqueness, nerve,
and talent it takes to be
the leader of the free world.
Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best woman...win.
- To prepare for the debate,
we have to do
an opening statement,
a closing statement.
We have to get in drag.
We have to come up with slogans.
So there's a lot
involved in this challenge.
- [snickers]
- I'm gonna get in trouble.
- Put her away.
- [laughing] What?
- Put her away.
- No way. Why would I?
- Why would you?
- I'm bringing back
the funk to America, honey.
I decided to do a
non-traditional character
and do something
a little bit edgier,
a little bit more dangerous,
take a risk.
How you doing?
- Two pink afros on a brown wig.
For him to pull that piece of
crap out and put it on his head,
like, for a presidential debate.
- I'm gonna give you lady pimp.
- For today's main challenge,
we're running for president...
in drag.
- It's like we're back in
school.
So...
The workroom is insanely quiet
right now.
And, like, everybody is just
thinking so hard
about their stuff,
and I'm just having a good time.
[belching]
[still belching]
[sighs loudly]
- I'm having the worst
brain fart right now.
- [belching]
[still belching]
Excuse me.
- I'm so confused.
[laughs]
This challenge is so tough.
I'm just struggling
with coming up with ideas.
Politics is not my comfort zone.
- I get it.
- I'm done.
- Work.
- Girl.
- Whew.
- You better come for it,
miss Phi Phi.
- I feel confident
in this challenge
because I always like to argue.
Y'all didn't take
debate classes in school?
- Uh-uh.
- I did.
I wanted to be a lawyer
when I was younger.
- That's why you're so
confrontational all the time.
- I just have to be right.
- Even when you're wrong.
- Bitch, I'm never wrong.
- You're wrong right now.
- Learn it.
- Are you writing answers
to your questions already?
- Yeah, aren't you done?
I mean, I took debate, like,
for seven, eight years.
- [laughs]
- And I'm a lawyer,
so hurry up and get it done.
- Hello, hello, hello.
- Hi, Ru.
- Hi, Ru.
- Ladies, I hope you're decent,
because we have company.
Journalist, political pundit,
and founder of the
It Gets Better Project,
Dan Savage.
- [contestants cheer]
- Awesome.
- Hello, candidates.
- Now, Dan's here to help you
prep for the big debate
and serve up
some political realness.
Hey, Latrice.
- Hey, Ru. How are you?
- Have you come up
with a campaign slogan?
- Of course.
"Everyone needs
a piece of Latrice."
- What about
"Peace with Latrice"?
- Ooh, that's very good.
So what is your platform?
- Well, I want more funding
for HIV and AIDS patients
who are on disability.
- But voters right now
are gonna ask you,
okay, if you're gonna make more
money available for that,
what are you gonna cut?
- Right.
- Oh, something gotta go?
- Yeah.
Like the wars.
- The war, yeah.
Politics, for real, for real.
This is not easy.
- Now, it's important
that you get your message across
and that you're not vague.
It has to be direct.
- Right.
- All right, Latrice,
we're gonna let you
get back to your campaign,
all right?
- Thank you.
- Break a lash.
- I will.
- Hi, Phi Phi.
- Hi, Ru.
- You're running for president?
- I am.
- What's your slogan?
- Um, "you can always Kiki
with your girl Phi Phi."
- You're offering to have sex
with all Americans?
- [laughs]
- Not Kai-Kai.
- Oh, okay, I'm confused.
- Kiki, yeah.
- Kiki means, like, you know,
like, we gossip with each other.
- Oh, okay.
- It rhymes with my name,
and it's easy to remember.
- But it's easy to
misunderstand, like I did.
So you might want to have
a couple of alternates.
- So what is your platform?
- Make America pretty.
You know, build warehouses, so
that way a bunch of drag queens
can make designer
human hair wigs.
- So you're providing jobs
or you're providing wigs?
- Both.
- Okay, so it's socialism
for drag queens, then.
The government
will give you your wig.
- Yeah.
I'm gonna be
the drag president, so...
- Listen, you have
to make it something
that really speaks
to every American.
You have to be really direct.
I'm gonna let you
get back to work, okay?
All right, thanks, Phi Phi.
Hi, Dida.
- Hi, Ru.
- You doing your homework?
- I'm trying.
- Now, it's important to know
what you stand for.
What is your platform?
My platform is really about--
for like, queens
who are kind of underpaid.
We are stars too,
and this is a job,
and it deserves the same respect
as any normal performer.
- Why should someone
who's not a drag queen
vote for you for president?
- That I haven't come up with.
I still have
some thinking to do.
- Do you vote, personally?
- I do, I do, I vote.
I just--politics
is kind of something
that's hard for me to discuss
because it can get personal.
It can get very ugly,
and I hate that, so--
- Which is why it's important
for us to pay attention,
because politicians are gonna
demonize sexual minorities.
And if they can count on us
checking out,
they're likelier to win
and then get into office,
where they can really
do us harm.
- Right.
Well, you just read me.
I'm not gonna lie.
- Just make sure that it really
comes from the heart.
- Okay.
- Good luck.
- He lit my complete
campaign on fire.
That's what Dan Savage did.
I feel fucked.
- Candidate Chad Michaels.
- Hey, RuPaul.
- I want to hear
all about the campaign.
- Well, I'm just gonna have
some fun, Ru.
- Yes?
- So I'm creating a crazy lady.
- Oh, boy.
- For my campaign, and her name
is Lady Pimp Michaels.
- So what are your
campaign slogans?
- My issues are mandatory rhythm
and funk lessons
for all school kids,
because we've really lost
the beat in this country.
- Are there any real issues
you want to inject?
Do you have a real issue?
- I haven't really put
any real issues into this.
'Cause I want to make this fun.
- Make sure the constituency
can relate to you.
- I get you.
- Which is gonna be a problem
if that's your outfit.
- That's a pantsuit.
What are you talking about?
- All right, thanks, Chad.
- Bye, guys.
- Sharon Needles,
the first drag president.
What campaign slogans
have you written?
- Um, some of my campaign
slogans are,
"America's government
needs a sex change."
- Well, what does that mean?
- Well, it means, you know,
that it's time that, you know,
not just a man or a woman
is in office, but a man-woman--
- Oh.
- You know, is in the office.
Someone who can play
both fields.
- Now, are you planning
any negative campaigning?
- I'm not going to create
negative attack ad campaigns
because I was bullied
my entire childhood,
and that's just not
the platform I'm going to be,
uh, working with.
I want to talk to the people.
- But everybody says that
till they're down in the polls.
- Well, I enjoy being down
on a poll, so...
I mean, that's just something
I can handle, I think.
- Okay, good for you.
- I know you have
a lot of work to do,
so I'm gonna let you
get back to it.
See you at the debate.
- Uh-huh.
- All right.
All right, ladies.
Remember, these are tough times.
And the future of this great
nation depends on you.
So don't fuck it up.
Let's go.
- Good evening, and welcome
to "Frock the Vote" 2012.
Give us 22 minutes,
and we'll give you an erection
for the election.
I am your moderator, RuPaul.
And I'm here
with my esteemed colleagues
Michelle Visage and Dan Savage.
Welcome, candidates.
Tonight your answers
will be timed.
The yellow light
is a ten-second warning.
The red light
means your time is up.
If you go over,
the secret service is here
to escort you from the building.
Let's kick things off
with opening statements.
Chad Michaels.
- Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.
My name is Chad
the Lady Pimp Michaels.
I am from California,
more specifically
the Shady Acres trailer park
on Doheny between
Weho and Beverly hills.
You might also remember me
as one of the first
transgendered dancers
on the<i> Soul Train.</i>
How you doin'?
[buzzer sounds]
What I plan to do is--
- Time is up, miss Michaels.
- The red light?
Shoes.
- Dida Ritz, same question.
- I am here,
and my name is Dida Ritz.
I'm here representing--or
running for wig party candidate.
And I'm here to talk
about the big "C" word today.
Change.
Change for the Ritz.
- Phi Phi O'Hara.
- Howdy, y'all.
I'm just a small
southern girl from Texas.
You can see me
on the bestseller's list,
<i>Vote for Phi Phi.</i>
I just want everybody to know
that you can always Kiki
with your girl Phi Phi.
- Sharon Needles.
- Ladies and gentlemen
and everyone in between,
my name is Sharon Needles.
For a long time,
this government has been
in dire need of a sex change,
and I'm just the drag queen
to perform that operation.
I'm Sharon Needles,
for sharing responsibilities.
- Latrice Royale.
- Good evening.
I am Latrice Royale.
Large and in charge,
chunky yet funky.
My fellow Americans,
everyone needs peace
with Latrice.
- All right, candidates.
The first question of the
evening from Dan Savage.
- Miss O'Hara, what experiences
from your past
make you the best candidate
to be America's first
drag president?
- Well, I have
lots of friends already,
like, in the government thing.
Ooh, like Sarah Palin.
And--and, like, when we used to
play "Spot That Russian!"
across the room,
like, my backyard or--
or when I was in Texas, we used
to go cow-tipping in drag.
- Oh.
[inaudible]
I'm scared for her.
- Yee-ha.
- Miss Royale?
- Coming from hum--
humble beginnings,
I was raised as a poor
black child in Compton.
I know what hard work,
dedication,
and perseverance means.
- All right, our next question,
from Michelle Visage.
- Miss Michaels,
as the first drag president,
how would you
redecorate the White House?
- I'm gonna paint
that bitch pink,
and I'm gonna fit the capitol
with an up-do.
Up...do.
Green light, look.
Yellow.
Bam, red.
[buzzer sounds]
- Chad has this, like,
master pimp thing going on.
I don't understand,
like, his storyline.
I mean, in a debate,
what is he debating about?
- [smacks lips]
- Dida Ritz.
- Well, first, I see everything
being Ralph Lauren.
I'm a big fan of Ralph Lauren
furniture,
Ralph Lauren paint,
Ralph Lauren rugs.
The drapery, Ralph Lauren.
- Girl, really?
- I would love
Ralph Lauren everything.
Thank you.
- Miss O'Hara.
- Hi.
- If you won the wig party
nomination,
which one of these queens
would you choose
as your running mate, and why?
- Well, being this time period,
I think it's so great
that the help can sit there
and compete alongside with me.
So I'd definitely like
to say my help, Dida Ritz,
and the other help I had,
Latrice Royale.
[laughs brightly]
Yee-ha.
- Did she just call me
"the help"?
I don't even do windows.
- I'm from Compton, bitch.
I'll whip yo' ass.
- Miss Ritz, should drag queens
be allowed to marry?
- I truly believe drag queens
should be allowed
to get married,
whether a drag queen
wants to marry a drag queen
or a drag queen
wants to marry a dog.
Change for the Ritz.
- Sharon Needles.
- Drag queens should most
definitely
be able to get married.
They should also have the right
to get divorced.
I too would like to be
an unhappy married woman
and then receive
my alimony checks
to pay for my young lovers
and vacations.
Thank you, Dan.
- Our next question
from Michelle Visage.
- Miss Michaels,
How would you explain
why drag is important
to voters who aren't
familiar with drag?
- Me being the first
transgendered<i> Soul Train</i><span style="bodyStyle"> dancer,</i>
we need to get back
to basic family values.
We've forgotten all of our
pertinent dance moves.
We got to get back
to the sprinkler.
All right?
We got to get back
to the running man.
Oh, wait--
- That was the Roger Rabbit.
- That's the Roger Rabbit.
- Yeah.
- Look, I don't got nothing
to say about it,
I just--we did what we had to do
to, you know, to get by.
Look, yellow...
red.
- Miss Ritz,
unemployment is up,
higher than it's
ever been before.
How do you plan to put
more drag queens to work?
- Basically, to give them
more opportunities
to do what they love to do
by performing.
And no more of this $75 or $100
of bookings.
Queens deserve coins.
Drag costs montey.
It costs money to look,
well, this beautiful.
Thank you.
- Miss Royale,
politics can get so ugly.
Can you give us an example
of a time when you made peace
with someone you didn't
see eye to eye with?
- About five minutes ago.
I looked across at Miss O'Hara
and realized that she was ugly.
- Oh.
- And I'm at peace with that.
- [snickers]
- [laughing quietly]
- Miss O'Hara.
- Oh, howdy.
- How do you represent
the future of drag
in the U.S. of "Heyyy!"
- Well, first,
it's U.S. of "How-day!"
[laughs]
So I'm representing all, like,
the little southern girls
that like to warsh our drag,
like,
and hang 'em up to dry.
Oh, and then when we get,
like, our jewelry
and we like to polish rocks
and make beautiful jewelry
'cause remember, if you ain't
got that bling bling,
you probably didn't get it
from Phi Phi.
[laughs]
- You okay?
- Oh, I'm doing line dancing.
- All right, it's time to hear
the candidates'
closing statements.
Let's begin
with Miss Chad Michaels.
- At the end of the day,
I just want, you know,
to put someone down in my chair,
give them a good,
good scalp massage,
send them out,
and make them feel
like an American citizen.
Look, yellow.
One more time.
Red.
Those freaking lights.
Yellow, red.
- Miss Dida Ritz.
- I must say that I have a lot.
I have a lot
that I want to change.
Change for Ritz.
That's my slogan.
Thank you.
- Dida is coming off--like, her
answers are very "who cares?"
There's no passion,
no fire, no nothing.
- Latrice Royale.
- With my plans in effect,
we can look forward
to a fun-loving America,
an America where everyone
could be queen for a day.
Thank you.
- Candidate Sharon Needles.
- Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm not a ivy-league,
good old ladyboy.
I'm just a girl of the streets.
And that's where I learned
the American people.
From the dark black soil of Iowa
to the punk rockers
of Colorado...
<i>[My Country 'Tis of Thee</i><span style="bodyStyle"> plays]</i>
To the hippies of southern
California
to the blue-collar boys
of Pittsburgh,
I've walked in every single one
of their shoes.
I am of the people
and for the people.
I am Sharon Needles,
sharing responsibilities
for a better world.
- Miss Phi Phi O'Hara.
This evening,
you get the last word.
- I wanna live in a world
that--vote for Phi Phi--
that--that, you know,
hos can be pimps finally and--
vote for Phi Phi--
and I just want to say--
vote for Phi Phi--
where, you know,
Jesus loves you.
And I didn't have a big enough
heart to cover you.
But I just want to say, America,
don't be a drag.
Yeah.
Oh, I mean be a drag.
Ha, ha, ha!
Howdy.
I won.
- I did find Phi Phi
annoying tonight.
You gotta know when to quit.
[snorts]
[sniffs]
- Oh.
- Thank you, candidates.
That concludes our
"Frock the Vote" debate.
Remember to come early
on election day.
Oh, and don't forget to vote.
Good night, everybody.
- Walk this way.
- Hoo!
- Another day,
another dead diva, honey.
- Yesterday we had
our presidential debate.
And today we have to get ready
for the inaugural ball.
- Don't politics seem
like a drag queen
dressing room nowadays?
- Basically.
It's mudslinging.
It's not cute.
- I mean, I know yesterday
was a drag competition,
but I kind of wish we
could've used it a little more
as a platform
to talk about things that,
you know, we really wish
we could see changed.
- But, you know what?
This is<i> Drag Race,</i>
and it's, like--
- I'm sorry.
That's how I feel like.
I'm not trying to cut you off,
but that is exactly
my frustration.
This is<i> Drag Race.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
This is not the news.
- It's always been my policy,
especially, like,
when I'm working at shows,
you don't mix drag and politics.
I'm out to entertain people
and make them feel good
and not to spread my political
beliefs at the gay bar.
- I mean, the reality
of the fact is,
is Dan Savage is a comedic
political and sex advice writer
who is now taking
responsibility in this world
to try and, you know,
make it better.
I didn't have a Dan Savage
when I was in high school,
and I got it bad.
- Dan Savage
and all he does for, you know,
as an advocate and all that,
it's--it's great.
That's not me...that's Dan.
- We are given an opportunity
that no other drag queen
is given,
and that's a platform
to actually talk about things--
- And I agree with that,
and when I had that platform
to be able to speak,
when I had--
- When I was a kid,
I didn't have a Dan Savage.
- I felt like he trashed me.
Coming in here that serious
about something that was
supposed to be drag-related
and fun at the same time,
mixing views
and important issues
that are going on in the world--
- Right.
- Calm down.
I'm not a really big
fan of politics
because of how ugly it can get.
It doesn't take all that
screaming and hollering
to change the world.
- Did you guys ever run
for anything in school?
- No, I didn't.
- I ran for student council.
- I never did
'cause I didn't want
to really draw
any attention to myself.
I just thought that I would get,
like, harassed more.
- I was the only kid in my
school that,
you know, would say
that I was gay, so...
- Right.
- And, like, I wasn't just gay.
I was, like, gay and weird.
- Right.
- And I got bullied bad,
and I never told my parents
about it.
- I would always tell
the school, and, like,
they would all say, you know,
"Ignore it. Ignore it."
- Kids bully
out of insecurities,
but teachers have
the responsibility to stand in
and help kids
that are getting it.
- I don't know
how things have changed
since I was in high school,
but teachers never really
stepped up to halt anything.
- Well, and as self-serving
as being a drag queen is,
it does feel nice to know that
just having this exposure that
we're having right now--
not to sound cliché, but if I
can just help one child--
- Oh, don't go there.
- Just one.
- [laughing]
- [dramatically] One child,
I've done my part.
- [laughing]
[RuPaul's<i> Cover Girl</i><span style="bodyStyle"> playing]</i>
And what?
Hey, guys.
- Hey.
- Welcome to the main stage
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
My commander-in-queef,
Michelle Visage.
- Yes, we can,
palm beach princess.
- [chuckling]
And Santino Rice.
How are you?
- I'm good, Ru.
- And our super-delegate
from Absolut, Jeffrey Moran.
- Hello, darling.
- Always good to have you here.
Dan Savage.
Now, is this election
totally leotarded, or what?
- There are some total leotards
running in this election,
but I think
we're gonna be all right.
- This week,
our queens frocked the vote
in a heated presidential debate.
Tonight they're ready
to rock the runway,
dressed for the inaugural ball.
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.
- Phi Phi O'Hara.
Call her miss Ross.
Her ballot box is stuffed.
- [laughs]
- It's bedazzled is what it is.
- It sure is.
- I want all eyes on me.
I'm serving them fresh,
young inaugural realness.
- She's got this election
all tied up.
- [laughs]
- Dida Ritz.
In all black.
She's courting the black vote.
- [laughs]
- I'm serving<i> Breakfast at</i>
<i>Tiffany's</i><span style="bodyStyle"> realness.</i>
I feel confident.
I feel so beautiful.
I love my hair, and I love
the color that I went with.
I feel like it is just right.
- President Morticia Addams?
- Ooh, is that a read, Dan?
- Chad Michaels!
- Don't you mean
Lady Bird Michaels?
- Very Marcus Bachmann.
- Ooh.
- In his dreams.
- Yes, in his dreams.
- [laughs]
- I feel like
that Republican lady
that the politician
can take to the ball,
but then take her back home
and she's a whore in bed.
- Very Republican lady.
"Gorge" Bush.
- "Gorge" bush, that's it.
[laughing]
- Latrice Royale.
Working the Beltway.
- Hey.
- You ain't ever
seen a president
look this sexy in your life.
I am throwing it, baby.
I want you to see all this shape
in its full glory.
- Now, that's what I call
a war chest.
- [laughs]
- She went that-a-way.
President Sharon Needles.
- Take me to your leader.
- Yes.
- [laughs]
That's what the Bush twins
wanted to wear
to the inaugural ball.
- I am serving
transparency realness
with a gown made
out of pantyhose
and hair
that hits the debt ceiling.
- I can see
right through her candidacy.
- Yes.
That dress shows off
her stimulus package.
- Welcome, ladies.
We've all watched your debate.
Now it's time for some political
analysis from our judges.
Let's start with Phi Phi O'Hara.
Tell us about
your inaugural gown.
- Well, I decided to wear white.
It's fun. It's elegant.
- Or was it just trying
to court the white people?
- [chuckles]
- Or the help?
- Ooh.
- I think it's so great
that the help can sit there
and compete alongside with me.
- I am clearly all about
political incorrectness,
but in order to land an
off-color joke,
it has to be funny, and that
joke came across as offensive.
And being a black woman,
I got a little offended.
- [laughs]
- People shouldn't get upset.
It's a joke,
'cause that's not me. Like--
- I thought your conservative,
Palinesque character
was really funny,
and I thought you did
a really great job.
You could have even taken it
further for my liking.
- But we all have to be
in on the joke.
It's the fart in church.
Not everyone
thinks that's funny.
It sometimes stinks.
- All right.
Next up, Dida Ritz.
- I thought you were
the weakest debater.
There was a lot of word salad
going on.
Just a bunch of words tossed up
into the air,
and it wasn't Tina Fey,
Sarah Palin hilarious.
It was just a little mystifying.
- Well, I tried
as hard as I could.
When questions were being asked
to me,
it was just kind of like
a deer in headlights moment.
It kind of makes me
uncomfortable,
to be honest with you.
- It may be uncomfortable
to talk politics, certainly,
but remember,
you're in the running
for America's next
drag superstar.
You exude beauty,
but we also want to know
that you're smart.
- Next up, Chad Michaels.
Hi, Chad.
- Hi, RuPaul.
- Tell me about the debate.
- This challenge
was intimidating to me.
Heavy debate and politics
are not my forte,
but I didn't come here
not to rise to the occasion,
so I created
the lady pimp character.
- I loved you in the debate,
and I loved your character.
Every four years,
there are joke candidates.
Newt Gingrich, Michele Bachmann.
- [laughs]
- And you were
sending those guys up.
You were just stellar.
- You're the only queen tonight
that really looks like you're
going to the inauguration.
- I see Mamie Eisenhower
up there,
and it hearkens back to a time
when the economy
wasn't in the fucking toilet.
- [laughs]
All right, let's move on
to Miss Latrice Royale.
- Hi, Ru.
- What was your platform
and slogan?
- My slogan was, "Everyone
needs peace with Latrice."
And I had a couple of issues,
such as medication
and more funding
for HIV and AIDS patients.
- Did you say that
in the debate?
- I didn't get a chance
to bring it up.
- You say you didn't get
a chance to bring it up,
but there were actually
several opportunities
where the light
hadn't gone off yet,
so you had chances,
but they slipped
through your fingers somehow.
- Right.
- Right now, it looks more like
you're going to an awards show
rather than an inauguration.
It doesn't look expensive
or luxurious,
and, um, is that
your bra strap coming out--
- Right here?
- On this side?
- It made my titty look funny
if I pushed it down.
I can put it away for you.
- Girl, do not wear your bra
sticking out of a gown.
[imitates slap]
- Okay.
- It's better.
- All right.
Up next, Sharon Needles.
So tell me about
your inaugural gown.
- It's, uh,
it's a little futuristic
because, let's be honest,
a drag queen's not gonna be
president for 100 years,
so I had to think ahead.
- [laughs]
- It works. It all works.
The proportions work,
and the nude and the black,
and especially with the hair
you have tonight,
you hit the nail on the head.
- As far as your debate goes,
I just got that you were a woman
there who meant business
and you wanted to be heard.
I thought you got the message
across hilariously.
- I'll be honest, I got scared
as hell when you came out
on the runway tonight.
It was good and bad for me.
- Sharon Needles, is there
anything you'd like to say.
- Um, I love vodka, and, um--
[laughter]
I have responsibly enjoyed your
company many a night.
[laughter]
- Thank you, ladies.
I think we've heard enough.
While you enjoy
an Absolut cocktail
in the Interior
Illusions Lounge,
the judges and I will
deliberate.
[engine starting sound effect]
All right.
Just between us girls,
let's caucus,
starting with Phi Phi O'Hara.
- Phi Phi committed
to the Palinesque character.
Even if one or two of her jokes
fell flat,
I still thought
it was believable.
- I have respect for people
who should be committed
and are committed.
[laughter]
But it kind of flopped.
It didn't really hit the jokes.
So, for me, it misses the mark.
- All right...Dida Ritz.
Well, she said she was
intimidated by this challenge.
- But you have to go
out on a limb sometimes,
and you have to step
out of your comfort zone.
I mean, this is a competition.
- She's a beautiful queen.
- Beautiful.
- But there's always
something off about Dida.
She'll get the hair right
and the makeup right,
and then the body's off.
She'll get the body right,
and then the hair's like, what?
- Now, Michelle, any cons?
[laughter]
- I think she's fierce.
- No, she is, absolutely.
That's why she's here.
- Is she taking advantage
of being here?
Like, is she gonna take some
feedback and make some changes,
or just react defensively?
- Let's move on down the line
to Chad Michaels.
- I loved Chad
during the debate.
It wasn't just
this one-note character,
kind of like Phi Phi had.
Chad had a fully-realized
human being.
- And she was going
for yet another character.
I love a chameleon,
but we've seen a lot already,
and I'd love just a glimpse of
who the real Chad Michaels is.
- All right.
Latrice Royale.
- She didn't have a character.
She started strong,
and I was really in it with her,
and then I think
she lost her way.
- And why do we
have to tell somebody
to tuck their bra in their dre--
like, this is top five, people.
But they shouldn't be making
these mistakes at this point.
- That's true.
- But in the debate,
she was an imposing presence,
uh, and people look for that
in a president.
She had gravitas.
- There's an ointment
that will clear that up.
[laughter]
Sharon Needles.
- I love her aesthetic
and I love her sense of humor,
and I thought
it was really effective.
We're all here,
pretending that a drag queen
could get elected president,
and she walked out there
and said, "Not for 100 years."
- [laughs]
- And she's right.
- But you have to remember,
if you're gonna be America's
next drag superstar,
you don't want to do
shock value all the time.
- All right.
Silence!
Bring back...my girls.
Welcome back, ladies.
The votes have been tallied.
Chad Michaels,
you created
a candidate with character,
and you took the wig party
back to its roots.
You're safe.
- Thanks, guys.
- Sharon Needles, you took your
campaign to hell and back
and gave us much more
than politics as usual.
Condragulations, you are the
winner of this challenge...
[applause]
And you've won a $5,000
gift certificate
from interiorillusionshome.com.
- Thank you so much, and, um,
see you at the Iowa primary.
- Dida Ritz,
during the debates,
you cracked.
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
- Oh, my God.
I'm gagging.
The last thing I want is for me
to be in the bottom two.
- Phi Phi O'Hara, your
politically incorrect politician
was...polarizing.
Latrice Royale, your debating
skills were debatable.
Phi Phi O'Hara...
you're safe.
You may join the other girls.
Latrice Royale,
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
- [silently]
Okay.
I'm devastated,
but I'm not ready to go.
- Two queens stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me
and save yourself
from elimination.
The time has come for you
to lip-synch for your life.
[dramatic music]
Good luck...
and don't fuck it up.
- I am in heaven.
I am channeling<i> Superstar.</i>
Honey, I feel
like I'm performing
to an arena of 20,000 people.
- This is old school.
- You need to understand where
these words are coming from
and get the emotion out,
and that's what I did.
- Latrice was taking me
to church.
I mean, my skin started smoking.
She was good.
[cheers and applause]
[laughter]
- Ladies,
I have made my decision.
Latrice Royale...
shantay, you stay.
You may join the other girls.
- Thank you, thank you.
Love you, baby.
- [whispering]
- Dida Ritz,
you are a young queen
with a lot of imagination,
so keep on keepin' on.
Now, sashay away.
- Thank you.
See you later.
I'm not upset.
I have no regrets at all.
This is only the beginning.
I've made it all the way
to top five,
and I am<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> royalty now.</i>
- Ladies, as you know,
each week,
I consult with the judges,
but the final decision
is mine to make.
Once again, I've been criticized
for sending some of my queens
home too soon.
Michelle, I want you
to confer with Santino
to decide which one
of the eliminated queens
deserves to return...
[dramatic chord]
To this competition.
- [gasps]
- Oh, shit.
Here we go again.
- No!
Bitch, top four.
No mo' hos.
- Will it be Alisa summers,
Lashauwn Beyond, the Princess,
Madame LaQueer,
Li'l Kenya Michaels,
Milan, Jiggly Caliente,
Willam, or Dida Ritz?
Choose wisely, Michelle,
for the world is watching.
Now, if you can't love yourself,
how in the hell
you gonna love somebody else?
Can I get an amen in here?
- all: Amen.
- All right.
Now let the music play.





- Previously
on<i> RuPaul's Drag Race...</i>
you'll need to survive
the biggest drag disaster
of all time.
The Rupocalypse.
- [screams]
- Ooh, shit,
it's falling apart.
- Jiggly's costume
is a hot mess.
- Jiggly Caliente...
Lashauwn Beyond...
The Princess, Sharon Needles.
- This is my kind of ghoul.
- Con-drag-ulations.
You are the winner
of this challenge.
- Thank you.
- I'm just in disbelief
that I'm here.
- Bitch, you're here.
- Yeah, honey, you better snap
out of it.
Play to win.
Jiggly Caliente,
shantay, you stay.
- Thank you.
- Alisa Summers, sashay away.
And tonight...
you'll be transforming
yourselves into wrestling's
trashiest fighters.
The dolls throw down...
- Get out.
- You're fake-ass hoes.
Get out of here.
[audience oohing]
- And take flight.
- Chicago, bitch.
[screaming]
- With extra-special
guest judges
NBA stars Rick Fox
and John Salley.
[cheers]
The winner of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i>
will receive a lifetime supply
of NYX cosmetics, a
one-of-a-kind trip courtesy of
ALandCHUCK.travel, headline
Logo's<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> tour, featuring</i>
Absolut vodka:
cocktails perfected,
and a cash prize of $100,000.
And may the best woman win.
- A gorgeous day.
- Good morning, cluckers.
- We walk in the work room this
morning, and we see Alisa's
message, and it's kind of sad.
I mean, it was official.
Week by week, we're all going to
be going home.
- "Keep it cute, ladies!
"Shady sisters 4-ever!
Love, Alisa."
- Look what you've done.
- That's what you've done, baby.
- It was either her or me,
and I was not going home.
- Let's take a vote.
Can we switch Jiggly for Alisa?
- Yeah, I agree.
- Whoo!
[laughter]
- Being in the bottom two
shook me.
I feel like there's a target
on the back of my head.
And all these bitches are trying
to assassinate me.
So nervous now.
'Cause now I have to really
prove myself.
- Well, can I give you
a piece of advice?
Just really try to stay
more focused
on the competition.
Like, don't--
- I know.
- It was, like--I thought
that I was focused.
I feel like I have to claw
and dig my way
back to the top.
- So you're feeling good
about your win?
- Oh, I'm feeling fantastic
about my win.
- You fucking rocked it.
It was kind of made for you.
- I know.
I'm such a natural loser
that it was very odd for me
to win a challenge.
I'm the freak queen,
and back home,
I'm kind of like
the laughingstock
of the drag community.
And I'm not
used to winning anything.
So it's exciting,
but at the same time,
it's really humbling.
- They're calling you the silent
killer, bitch, because
everybody thought you were gonna
win the challenge.
- I mean, I did think I was
gonna win,
but I understand
why I didn't win.
- Well, after she had said--
- I'm too quiet.
- Yeah, you're too quiet, bitch.
- I was quiet because I was
trying to focus.
My strategy isn't gonna change,
because I know that I prepared
a package to beat these girls.
So, I mean, I'm fine.
- Speak up, Lashauwn.
- Can everybody hear me?
- Fly away.
[siren wails]
[all oohing]
- Girl, you got she-mail.
[cheers]
Hello, dolls.
all: Hi.
- I've come to pump you up.
And I don't mean your lips.
So get ready to beat your mug,
pummel the runway, and fight for
the spotlight.
It's time for some necessary
roughness.
But, remember, just anything
but the face.
I'll get the money, mister.
Just don't hurt my face, please.
[applause]
Hello, hello, hello.
- RuPaul!
- Hi.
[cheers and applause]
Now, ladies, as you know,
padding is the foundation
of drag.
A queen's girlish figure
depends on it.
For today's mini challenge, I
want you to make an ass
of yourself.
Literally. Oh, pit crew.
- Whoo!
- You have 30 minutes to put
all this junk in your trunk.
I'm dividing you
into three groups.
And the one queen from each
group with the juiciest ass
will win.
Ready, set, style.
[exclamations and shouting]
- Don't kick over my packing
peanuts.
- I make fierce pads, but this
ain't how I usually make my
pads, y'all.
- 30 minutes is not enough.
You need at least a good hour
to even start making pads.
- When making your ass, always
draw the shape of Africa.
- That's it.
- Or, as Latrice would say,
the homeland.
- [giggles]
I'm Polynesian, bitch.
Get it straight, honey.
- I thought we were doing an
athletic challenge,
so I'm in a jock.
Sorry about it.
- Okay, lady-kins, time's up.
All right.
Apple bottoms.
Now Jiggly is serving cellulite
realness.
[laughter]
- Yeah, that's how realness is.
- Now walk that ass.
Bottoms up.
Shake it, don't break it.
Phi Phi O'Hara, now that's what
I call a power bottom.
Seems like your pants are coming
down, Madame.
- [screams]
[laughter]
- Madame.
- Next up, the ghetto booties.
Make it pop. Now walk.
- Hips don't lie.
But that ass do.
Girl, can I get some fries
with that shake?
[laughter]
Damn.
- I had a proper ghetto booty,
and I was the only one wearing
lipstick.
- Next up, the badonkadonks.
- A badonkadonk booty, it's
like a whole bunch of
donkadonkadonkadonkadadadada...
- Now walk.
Ass everywhere, ass everywhere.
Ass everywhere.
Ooh, two scoops.
Ladies, all y'all
is sassy assassins.
But three of you really
killed it.
The winners of this mini
challenge are...
Miss Phi Phi O'Hara...
[cheers]
Miss Willam...
[applause]
Miss Chad Michaels.
- Hey.
- Con-drag-ulations.
If I were you, I'd hold on tight
to my padded ass, because, for
this week's main challenge,
you'll be transforming
yourselves into wrestling's
trashiest fighters--the luscious
ladies of the WTF.
- Yes!
- Whoo-hoo.
- I am a big bitch.
Who is gonna outwrestle me?
Nobody.
- Oh, my god.
I am not athletic at all.
- This week, you'll need to
flex your charisma, uniqueness,
nerve, and talent to become
over-the-top wrestling
characters.
You will compete in teams.
Phi Phi O'Hara, Willam,
Chad Michaels, since you won the
mini challenge,
you are team captains.
You get to pick your queens,
starting with Phi Phi.
- I'd have to go with Latrice.
- Yes.
- Dida.
- I will take Milan.
- Yeah.
- Come on down, baby.
- Kenya.
- [growls]
- Princess.
- Miss Needles.
- I am a knockout.
[laughter]
Uh, ow.
- I didn't want Jiggly or
Madame LaQueer because they're
always complaining that their
feet hurt or they don't want to
do active stuff.
Lashauwn.
- [growls]
- There we go.
- All right, Willam, it's
between Jiggly and
Madame LaQueer.
- I'm just praying, "Please pick
me, pick me, pick me,
pick me, pick me."
- Jiggly.
- [grunts]
- Yes!
- Wah!
[laughter and applause]
- All right, so that means
that Chad gets Madame LaQueer.
- It feels kind of weird
being, like, the last picked.
You know, the weird boy, but
I'm used to it, though.
- Each team needs to decide
which two will play the
heroines, or the faces, and
which two will play the
villains, or the heels.
In a moment, you'll meet three
pros who will coach you in the
art of wrestling.
Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best woman win!
- Let's do a script.
- Mama, you got a dream team
here.
- I know.
That's why I picked it.
- There's something very
important.
I had a previous injury
in my right ankle.
I hurt my right ankle
doing a show.
I didn't saw the step, and my
ankle goes click, and suddenly
I couldn't walk.
- Are you gonna be okay, I
mean, like, with your ankle?
- Don't worry about my ankle.
- I am gonna worry about it,
because it's important.
If your ankle's hurting and you
can't do something, you need to
let me know, because I can't
read your mind.
- I'm so happy with this team.
- I know. I'm excited.
- This challenge includes a lot
of steps.
We have to come up with a back
story, looks, costumes,
moves, everything.
I'm really good with falls and
being, like, stunted.
I do stairs. I can do anything.
I'm really excited because I
usually play people who get beat
up, and I got my ass kicked on
every major network.
- And we just make sure that
we--attitude, attitude,
attitude.
- Wrestling isn't my thing.
I'm not a violent person.
So I'm a little concerned.
- We are gonna ace this,
you guys.
We gon' kick their ass.
- So our challenge is to become
wrestlers.
We're the first team to go up
and practice.
I see three humungous dudes just
going at each other.
Oh, my god. This is real.
- [whimpers]
- I'm "Hollywood's Own"
Joey Ryan.
-<i> Yo soy</i><span style="bodyStyle"> Hector "El Chido"</i>
Canales.
- I'm Mr. K.O.S.
"King of Submission"
Ryan Taylor.
- Let's now get into a little
bit of the choreography.
Go ahead and throw her
onto Ryan.
- Oh.
- You're gonna catch her and
fall.
- This bitch heavy.
- And then you fall
on your back.
- Oh, my god.
- Fall, bitch.
- As safely as possible.
- Oh, my god.
- I'm worried Lashauwn's not
gonna actually get the concept
of what she has to do here.
Come on, girl. Come on.
- [speaks indistinctly]
- [whimpers]
- [growls]
- Everyone in my group's
personality is so loud...
[yells]
And I'm not really like that.
I'm really quiet and soft.
Oh.
[laughter]
- My god, Latrice.
- We're gonna show you
some strikes to the gut.
- [grunts]
- The big reaction is his sell.
And your sell will be here
and to the camera.
- All right.
I'm an actor.
I've been on TV a lot.
I'm cool. I can do it.
[grunting]
- Pop off, bitch!
- And I did.
I sold it.
I get a People's Choice.
- So the bad guys make their
entrance, they cannot care less
about the audience, right?
Make us hate you.
- Be yourself.
- I got this.
This is cake. Fuck y'all.
I don't give a shit.
New York, motherfuckers.
Brooklyn!
- Jiggly was very aggressive.
- Fuck y'all.
I've got this shit.
- And I was like, girl, take it
down a notch.
- New York, baby.
- I'm not from New York.
- Oh...
- And you were good too.
Princess is giving
closed-captioning,
while she's in stereo.
- Okay, you guys.
Exaggerate, okay?
Like, "Aah!"
Loud. Noise.
- Ahh!
- Larger than that.
- What the hell was that?
- I'm worried about Princess
because she's quiet.
I'm going "Rah! NY, baby!
This is--"
And she's like...
[mumbling indistinctly ]
And I'm like, "Huh?"
- We're gonna demonstrate some
holds for you.
Some wrestling moves for you.
We were thinking of a body slam.
- [laughs]
- Do any of you guys
have a problem with that?
- I'm a little worried
about the physical
extremities of this challenge.
- Let's have you try that
to her.
- Okay. All right.
Come on, Mrs. Ed,
with that horse face of yours.
- Stop, stop, stop, stop.
Stop a second. Stop.
Stop a second. Stop a second.
Stop a second. Stop a second.
You don't want to pick--
- Like a baby.
- Yeah.
- Oh, come on, Grandma.
Oh, my God!
Let me go.
[both grunting]
RuPaul once famously said
that drag
is not a contact sport.
Apparently, she's gone back
on her word.
[coughing]
- From there, we're gonna have
you give her
the airplane spin,
which they're gonna demonstrate
right now.
- It's a very fun--
- Okay.
- I'm concerned that something
could happen with my ankle and
making our team lose.
I have a lot
to be nervous about.
- All right, come on, Madame.
My damn face is sick
of looking at you.
- [grunting]
- Oh. Oh!
- Get her up.
- Put me down.
- Take your time. Slow.
- Jeez Louise.
- Ugh.
- Sorry.
- Ouch.
- You okay?
- I'm nervous about Madame
LaQueer.
She's not as physical as the
rest of us.
She really has to push, push,
and push through it.
- Ouch.
- Y'all got enough sewing
machines over there?
Y'all look like a sweat shop.
- I'm sorry, but did you see
Willam's outfit?
- Yeah.
- Phi Phi's gonna like me
eventually.
I know it.
I think her and I should just
unite with mutual enemies.
- [scoffs]
- I mean, it's just easier
to go after ugly people,
but, I mean, the ugly people
are gonna be gone
soon enough anyway.
- Okay, well, then who's
the ugly people?
- Well, not me.
- Hello.
- Hello, hello, hello.
all: Hi.
- Well, team Phi Phi O'Hara...
- Yes.
- Which team is the faces?
- It would be me and Lashauwn.
- So, of course, these two
are the heels.
What is your story?
- They gave us the wrong
treatment, and we grew beards
instead, and we're a little
bitter about that.
- Are you actually gonna
be wearing beards?
- Yes.
- You know, that concerns me a
little bit, because the luscious
ladies of the WTF need to be
beautiful.
- I think our story will get
across, and it's not that they--
- But you're not the one who's
gonna be looking hideous,
are you, darling?
People watch wrestling because
they want to be excited, they
want to be turned on.
They want beauty.
Now, Lashauwn, can you give me
a little taste of what your good
guy says?
- "Oh, I'm gonna kick your ass."
- In wrestling, the good guys
are just as loud and obnoxious
as the bad guys.
Is it fair to say that you're
still working on it,
you haven't...
- Yeah, we are
still working on it.
I mean, yeah, we are.
- I'm gonna let you
get back to it.
All right.
- Bye, Ru.
- Team Willam, what's going on?
Who on your team are the faces?
[laughs]
Now what are your costumes
gonna be like?
Was that something that you made
or you already had?
- We just embellished
on top of it.
- Oh, I see.
- And I'm embellishing on top
of mine as well.
- Jiggly, you took some heat
last week for your costume.
- Yeah.
- You know, we are looking for
the luscious ladies of the WTF.
- Oh, I'll be luscious.
I'm not trying to be in that
bottom two again.
- Gather around, dolls.
Now, tomorrow at the WTF
main event,
we'll be joined by our
extra-special guest judges...
NBA champions Rick Fox
and John Salley.
[cheers and applause]
- I think I'll tuck extra-tight
for Rick Fox and John Salley.
- Now, remember, safety first.
But, whatever you do,
don't fuck it up.
all: Bye, Ru.
- Whoo.
[cheers]
- Ladies and gentlemen, are you
ready to experience a female
phenomenon?
[cheers]
Bring on the glamazons!
[cheers and applause]
- Oh, my god, can you believe
those Bitter Betties
came in here to ask us for help?
And I even let them use, like,
my really good hair products.
- That product?
- Yeah.
- That's the hair-growing tonic.
- [speaks native language]
- You--look what you did
to her hair.
- Are you upset because you
can't handle all this fishiness?
- Your plastic hair and your
plastic tits
and your plastic ass.
We'll handle you.
We'll get in the ring.
- Bring it. Bring it on.
- Come on, girls. Come on.
[cheers]
[rock music]
- Mess with these nasty girls
and you'll end up with a bad
taste in your mouth.
Give it up for Latrice
"The Beast"
and "Killer" Kenya,
the Bitter Betties.
- Ooh.
[booing]
Go.
- Give it up for L.A.'s finest,
Lashauwn "The Blonde"
and Phi Phi "Fierce."
- The crowd was chanting and
all the signs had our names
everywhere.
It felt so good.
I was ready to beat those
bitches down.
[bell clinks]
- You're so pretty.
[exclamations]
- Ooh.
- Whoa!
[booing]
[cheers and applause]
- Get up!
- [speaks Spanish]
- Um, honey, I don't speak
Spanish.
[booing]
- I want to teach you Spanish
right now.
<i>Puta!</i>
[exclamations]
[screaming]
- Oh, hell, no.
- [shouts]
- Now I'm gonna show you how
to really beat a mug, bitch.
[screaming]
[booing]
Let me go! Let me go!
[screams]
[overlapping statements]
[screaming]
[exclamations]
[shrieking]
[bell rings]
[booing]
- Bitter, bitter pill
to swallow.
The Bitter Betties win.
[booing]
- Those other teams
better watch out
because, me and my girls,
we kicked ass.
[booing]
- Touch this skin, honey.
They can't take it.
- Mm-mm. They're overgrown...
both: Orangutans.
- Speaking of orangutans.
- What are you doing in our
dressing room?
- We know it's your dressing
room, as tacky as it is,
like y'all two bitches.
both: Tacky?
- Oh, no, honey, we don't want
to go there.
We saw you two
in Coach Carter's office.
- Oh, so that's how we got
kicked out of school?
'Cause of y'all bitches?
- Get out.
- You're fake-ass hoes.
Get out of here.
[cheers and applause]
- Tuck and cover...
- Shut up!
- Get the fuck out of here.
- For "Pucker Up" Princess
and "J-Train" Jiggly,
the Thunder Booties.
Get on the wrong side of these
sexy scissor sisters, and
they'll cut you--
Willamina "Hater"
and Dida "Diddles".
They're DWF.
- Come on, bitch.
[booing]
[bell clinks]
- Get 'em, girl.
- You plus-sized jujube.
- Oh, please.
[exclamations]
- Come on, bitch.
[exclamations]
- I'm giving it all, balls to
the wall, badass, crazy,
wrestler bitch.
- Whoop her ass.
[cheers]
- Get her!
- [yells]
- The Princess, she's not going
as crazy as I am.
So if I get in the bottom two
because of this bitch, it ain't
gonna be cute.
[shouting]
What?
- It's not fair.
[indistinct shouting]
That's not fair!
- Sumo smash!
[exclamations]
- And thank you.
[bell rings]
- The winner is Thunder Booties.
- Team Willam
put on a goddamn show.
[cheers and applause]
- Oh, Milan "LaModel", I have
to be honest with you.
I woke up with an itch down
there,
an itch in my pubic hair.
- I've got snatch-scratch
fever too.
- But forget about
this bitch of an itch.
Look who it is.
It's the Bitch Kickers.
- What's up there, Knockouts?
How's it hanging,
scratch 'n' sniff?
- [speaks nonsense]
- They must have gotten our
special delivery we sent in
when we banged their boyfriends.
- [chatters nonsense]
Boink, boink.
- Oh, my god.
- That's right, LaQueer.
- Those Bitch Kickers.
Oh, those cheap, terrible girls.
[cheers and applause]
- Serving face with a side of
whoop-ass.
Give it up for Sharon "Shocker"
and Milan "LaModel"--
the Knockouts.
Don't hate these girls because
they're beautiful.
[booing]
- Shut your pie hole, you slut.
- Hate them because
they're bitches.
- You want some of this?
We got plenty for you too.
- Chadarella "Chainsaw" Michaels
and Madame "LaCrush"--
the Bitch Kickers.
[bell clinks]
- You skinny little
blonde bimbo.
You can run, but you can't hide.
- All right, well, I'm fast
as a butterfly--
[exclamations]
No!
[booing]
[coughs]
- I am a little bit worried
about Madame LaQueer 's ankle.
I mean, you're the captain
of the ship,
you're going down
with the ship.
- All right, Kirstie Alley
before<i> Dancing with the Stars.</i>
[exclamations]
[shouts indistinctly]
This is not in my contract!
- If my ankle hurted, I forgot
about everything.
I was Madame "LaCrush"
in that moment.
[cheers and applause]
- Joan Jett called.
She wants her wig back.
[exclamations]
[shouting]
[crowd chanting indistinctly]
- You're mine now, baby!
I'm gonna hit you
in your visage.
[crowd chanting "USA"]
- No one hits my sister!
Why?
Because I'm sickening, bitch!
[cheers]
- Chicago, bitch!
[shouting]
[cheers and applause]
[bell rings]
- Okay.
- The Knockouts have won!
[cheers and applause]
- We might have been slightly
sloppy,
but I think our team created
the best characters.
[cheers and applause]
- Yay.
- Miss Cheesecake.
It's elimination day, and
everyone's really anxious right
now to find out how they did in
the wrestling challenge.
I think we have a really good
shot at winning.
- I hope.
- I'm just worried.
- What are you worried about?
You did great.
You were so funny.
Were you unpleased with anything
when you left the ring
yesterday?
- With me, no.
I am kind of iffy
about Princess.
It is a competition, and, they
don't like one thing, the whole
team goes on--
it's a team challenge.
- That energy you're giving off
is bringing everybody else down.
Girl, I cannot be bothered
right now.
- Are you nervous today?
- You know what, I am a little
bit nervous.
You might feel some sort of kind
of way, and you could be dead
wrong.
- Mm-hmm.
- Thinking you sickening bitch
and talented bitch,
and they be like, "wah-wah-wah."
- I'm a little nervous to see
what the judges think about me
in the ring.
I did my best, but you never
know what they're gonna say.
- You sew for all the girls
back at home?
Like, the girls.
The girls the girls.
- Just girls like you.
By me sewing so much, I don't
really get a chance
to even be in drag myself.
- Uh-huh.
- So it's like I missed
my drag childhood.
- Ha ha.
- So that's why the competition
is perfect for me, 'cause I'm
just filling in for what I
missed out on.
- That's sickening, 'cause you
definitely
about to make up
for some lost time.
- Ooh.
- Hey-hey, that's what you get.
The ultimate drag boot camp
of life.
- Madame, what does your family
think about you doing drag?
- I'm not close to my family
at all.
My family, for me, are my
friends.
They're the best friends
in the whole world.
Baby, don't. It's okay,<i> mami.</i>
- We're selfish and vain
creatures of beauty, and isn't
it bizarre how we make the best
friends in the world?
- [laughs maniacally]
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, baby.
- Welcome to the main stage of
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
Michelle Visage, my tag team
sister.
- I got a full nelson for you
right here, mama.
- [chuckles]
Billy B, welcome home.
- Thanks, Ru.
- Are you wrestling
with something?
- Not since I was trying to get
my wallet back
from Michelle in the back.
- [chuckles]
Hey, Rick Fox, what did you
think of my girls?
- I was impressed.
Think there was a lot of fight.
- Good. And John Salley.
- Hello, Ru.
- BK in the house.
[laughter]
I'm so glad you're here.
This week, our queens were
challenged to hit the mats as
the luscious ladies of the WTF.
Tonight, I've asked them all
to come decked out in their best
girly-girl attire.
Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best woman win!
First up, Kenya Michaels.
Gorgeous.
You know, lil' Kim only wishes.
- It's a pink Monday.
- I love the runway.
I feel amazing
because I love to walk.
- Now that is a living doll.
- Mary-Kate Minaj.
Lashauwn Beyond.
She melts in your mouth,
not in your hand.
- Got a penny? She's got a ball.
- [laughs]
- I'm serving bubble gum
yum-yum,
just having fun being
flirty, pretty, going girly
beyond.
- I'd like to stick a quarter
in her slot.
- Where is her slot anyway?
- Sharon Needles.
- Ooh.
The lost Arquette sister.
- Oh, wow, she's doing femme.
She got an injection of beauty.
- Playing girly-ish, bouncy,
and sexy is just something
really foreign to me.
Just want to show the judges
that I could bring beauty
to the stage
in this competition.
- Mwah.
For your consideration,
Jiggly Caliente.
- Kimora lee Simmons
has put on some weight.
- You're jiggling, girl.
- I'm serving banjee girl
meets sweet 16, very new York.
- It's Jiggly 's quinceanara.
London, Paris, Milan.
I see London, I see France, I
see Milan 's underpants.
- I am feeling like black Barbie
meets a valley girl.
But, because John Salley is
there, I'd rather
be the Salley girl.
- Once she gets pumping,
it's hard to make the body stop.
- Madame LaQueer.
Representing Puerto Rico.
- [speaks Spanish]
She's working the asymmetrical
hairdo.
- Or a hair show in Mississippi.
- I feel great.
I feel like I'm floating.
I think is the most beautiful
I've looked
throughout all the competitions.
- Where there's smoke,
there's a pussy on fire.
[laughter]
- This is why I love this show.
- Dida Ritz.
- I thought
it was P. Diddy's mom.
- [laughs]
- Janice Combs.
- I'm giving fish, I'm giving
face, I'm giving you vogue.
I know my runway is fierce.
- Look at those legs.
My good--and they go
all the way up.
- They do? Are you sure?
- Yeah.
- They're not wooden?
- Chad Michaels.
Lady "chadderley".
Oh, my goodness, the world
according to Paris.
- Paris Hilton,
where are they now?
- I'm serving up girly-girl
realness fish on a stick.
I kind of look just like
a yummy little cupcake.
- Heidi Montag called.
She wants her old body back.
The Princess.
She had a little time
for a quick blowout
before she came out.
- It's a windstorm backstage,
I'm thinking.
- Yes, yes.
- The look I'm going for is
very rock star
meets little girl.
I am so pumped
for my look today.
- Rock on.
- It's like there's something
about The Princess.
- [laughs]
- Up next, Phi Phi O'Hara.
- Telemundo.
- Telenovela realness.
- I was showing
a little bit of skin
and giving them dragged-out
Miami housewife.
- Ooh, her legs are like peanut
butter--easy to spread.
Latrice Royale.
Ooh, crown Royale.
I'll have one on the rocks.
- I am feeling good and
looking gorgeous, darling.
Pretty in pink.
I was very pleased.
- Star Jones called.
She wants her old body back.
- She can't have it.
It's otherwise preoccupied.
- Allegedly.
[laughter]
Next up, Willam.
- Hey.
- Wow.
Look at those shoes.
- My look for today
is rich bitch mistress.
I'm serving girly-girl on a
platter to go,
sauce on the side.
- Look how her outfit
accentuates her sugar walk.
-<i> Toddlers and Tiaras,</i>
where are they now?
- I think she's Tanya Tucker.
My girls.
You look smashing.
Yesterday, you changed the face
of professional wrestling
forever.
I smell a spin-off.
But one group in particular
really smacked down
the competition.
The winning WTF team is...
Team Chad Michaels.
- Whoo!
- Jesus.
[laughter]
- Thank you, Ru.
- Con-drag-ulations, ladies.
But two divas stole the show.
Madame LaQueer, Chad Michaels.
- The Bitch Kickers.
- Good job, ladies.
- You are both the winners of
this week's challenge.
You'll receive a selection of
wigs from Risque Wigs.
- Oh, my god, I feel so great.
I certainly actually proved them
wrong about having
picking me last.
- However, neither of you will
receive immunity next week.
Team Chad Michaels, you may
leave the stage.
Ladies, it's time for the
judges' critiques.
First up, Willam.
Hey, mama.
- Hi.
- Did everything turn out
the way you had planned?
- I think our moves kicked ass.
- Oh, I thought the competition
was weak in the ring.
The faces she was giving us
just didn't seem believable.
It was fake.
- Wait a minute.
Wrestling is not fake.
- No, that wrestling was fake.
- Thank you, Willam.
Next up, Dida Ritz.
Now why'd you choose this
as your girly look?
- I'm really channeling
Carrie Bradshaw,
so I thought downtown
New York, very chic.
- In the ring, you had,
you know,
the girl that sort of walked
around the ring thing perfect,
better than you had
the wrestling down.
- Thank you, Dida.
The Princess.
- I'm a fan from the hair
to the dress.
I think I bought that dress
for my daughter.
- I disagree. I hate your hair.
I think it looks
like a bad hair show.
- As far as the performance
goes, we didn't see any of the
rebel that I know you are.
- I'm a very Zen person.
Just know that
that was me really trying.
- Try harder.
- All right,
let's go to Jiggly Caliente.
May I call you Jiggly?
- Of course you can, Ru.
- How'd you feel on the runway?
- I felt so cute.
The lollipop in my mouth,
door knockers in my ears.
- The lollipop was more
interesting for me
than what you're doing
style-wise.
- And tell me about in the ring.
- It was very energetic
and over the top.
- Jiggly, what was the hardest
part of this challenge?
- The thing is, Princess is very
Zen, she's very quiet.
We needed to be, like, crazy,
badass bitches.
- It's hard,
when you're in a team,
and you're trying to make up
for both of you.
- Thank you, Jiggly.
Next up, Phi Phi O'Hara.
- Hi.
- You were reading older
than you have to.
You could be younger
and more modern.
- I'm watching you, Phi Phi.
I love you.
I think you're gorgeous,
and in the ring,
you were freakin' hi-lar-i-ous.
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Phi Phi.
Lashauwn Beyond.
- Hi, Ru.
- How are your balls?
- My balls are great.
- On the runway,
the gumball machine
told me exactly what
those balls were doing
on your chest.
- Better than on her chin.
- Ha!
- I couldn't disagree more.
Your hair and your makeup,
you look like
a backup singer for
Luther Vandross in 1988.
- Rick Fox, what'd you think?
The ring?
- It's not memorable enough
for me.
I would have liked
a little more story
and color to the character.
- Next up, Kenya Michaels.
- Hola.
- I thought it was Nicki Minaj.
I'm not joking you.
Except she doesn't have the ass
of Nicki or the money.
- What about as a wrestler?
As "Killer" Kenya?
- It was like it was
Biggie Smalls and lil' Kim
all over again.
Baby, baby.
- [laughs]
- You look like a star, you
look modern, you look
fashionable, and I think you're
the one to beat.
- Thank you.
- Latrice Royale.
- Hello, Ru.
- Shag-quille O'Neal Latrice.
- [laughs]
- You set the tone for the
whole afternoon.
- Oh!
- You had me at splat.
- [laughs]
Thank you, Latrice.
Well, ladies, I think we've
heard enough.
While you girls untuck in the
Interior Illusions Lounge, the
judges and I will deliberate.
You may leave the stage.
All right, just between us
brothers and brother-lovers...
- Thank you.
- Let's start with Willam.
- I think Willam is extremely
fierce and extremely talented
and very freakin' funny.
But I also think there's
a borderline of smarminess.
I think there might
be an attitude in there
that can get in the way.
- She seemed like a team captain
that didn't lead.
- I think she did a good job
of leading.
I don't feel that The Princess
did a good job of following.
- All right, let's talk
about The Princess.
- Her performance
was really flat.
- I kind of thought
there was a rock star in there.
- She's not charismatic enough
to be a rock star.
- Dida Ritz.
- She's pretty.
It's just the wigs are not
styled, they're not done.
- You know, she was going
for<i> Sex and the City,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
and it was more like<i> </i>
<i>Sex in the Alley.</i>
- Oh, okay.
Well, I'm not gonna turn
that down either.
- [laughs]
- Jiggly Caliente.
- In the ring, she uses
everything she has.
I thought that was an outfit
until I realized that was really
her belly.
- [laughs]
Phi Phi O'Hara.
- I don't know what's under
all that makeup,
but she doesn't
paint herself pretty.
- I know she's heavy-handed
on the makeup, but hey...
who isn't?
- [laughs]
Lashauwn Beyond.
Now, it was remarked that
Lashauwn's personality
was kind of shy.
- She'll get out of that shyness
when she realizes it doesn't get
her anywhere.
- She's a mess.
And her personality is like a...
Like a brick.
- All right, Kenya Michaels.
Little Puerto Rican sweetheart.
- She's half the size
of any of them
with double or triple
everything else.
There was nothing wrong.
- Her performance was flawless
as well.
I thought she did a great job
as "Killer" Kenya.
- Latrice Royale.
- She owned that role
in the ring.
It was hard for anyone else
to do better than that.
- I was very happy with her,
and I do really like her
and her personality.
So she's gonna be fun to watch.
- All right, silence.
Bring back my girls.
Welcome back, ladies.
Based on your presentation
in the main ring
and on the main stage,
I've made some decisions.
Latrice Royale, Kenya Michaels,
Phi Phi O'Hara,
you ladies jumped
on this wrestling challenge
and came out on top.
You are all safe.
- Thank you.
- You may leave the stage.
Jiggly Caliente,
we want to know,
is there more to you than just
a queen from the 'hood?
You are safe.
- Thank you. Thank you.
- You may join the other girls.
The Princess.
You were channeling pink,
but your performance was beige.
I'm sorry, my dear, but you are
up for elimination.
- I'm shocked.
My outfit was on it today,
whether Billy B
liked my hair or not.
And I worked my ass off
yesterday in the ring.
There's no reason why I should
have been in the bottom two.
- Willam...
you're safe.
- Bye.
- Lashauwn Beyond,
as a wrestler, you were more
mumble than rumble.
Dida Ritz, your<i> Sex and the City</i>
couture
does not deserve a sequel.
Dida Ritz...
You're safe.
- Thank you.
- Lashauwn Beyond, I'm sorry,
my dear, but you are up
for elimination.
- My whole body started pumping.
I'm nervous because I want
to stay in the competition
and I know this dictates
if I will or not.
- Two queens stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me and save
yourself from elimination.
The time has come to lip-sync
for your life.
- I'm pretty amazing,
and I'm ready to show it.
Bring it on.
- Good luck,
and don't fuck it up.
- I want to show Ru that I can
give more personality.
It's not over yet.
I'm not ready to go.
- I'm telling myself, soak up
this moment right now.
Live in it.
Balls to the wall do it.
- To do the whole song with
no shoes in closed-toed
pantyhose like a web-footed
duck, Lashauwn 's drag mother's
gonna read him for not even
starting the song in shoes.
[cheers and applause]
- Ladies...
I've made my decision.
The Princess...
Shantay, you stay.
You may join the other girls.
Lashauwn...
you are a young queen.
May this experience lift you
to new heights above and beyond.
Now sashay away.
- Thank you.
It's bittersweet, but...
I'm happy for me to be so young
and I've only been doing it for
such a short amount of time.
Some of these girls
being 40 and 50
and so...it was sickening.
- Con-drag-ulations, ladies.
And remember,
if you can't love yourself,
how in the hell you gonna love
somebody else?
Can I get amen up in here?
all: Amen!
- All right, let the music play!


-<i> Previously</i>
<i>on</i><span style="bodyStyle"> RuPaul's Drag Race....</i>
- I look spooky,
but I'm really nice.
- The weakest out of everybody,
I would say, is Sharon Needles.
- Shut up!
-<i> Are you ready to experience</i>
<i>a female phenomenon?</i>
[cheers and applause]
-<i> I'm nervous</i>
<i>about Madame LaQueer.</i>
She's not as physical
as the rest of us.
- Oh!
[screaming]
- Madame LaQueer,
Chad Michaels.
<i>You are both the winners</i>
<i>of this week's challenge.</i>
-<i> Oh, my God.</i>
<i>I feel so great.</i>
I certainly actually
proved them wrong.
- The Princess...
shantay, you stay.
Lashauwn, sashay away.
<i>And tonight...</i>
Music makes the people
come together.
<i>The dolls</i>
<i>get a special guest...</i>
- Hallelujah!
-<i> And testify.</i>
- All right.
-<i> With extra-special</i>
<i>guest judges</i>
<i>Natalie Cole</i>
<i>and</i><span style="bodyStyle"> Glee's</i><i> Amber Riley.</i>
<i>The winner</i>
<i>of</i><span style="bodyStyle"> RuPaul's Drag Race</i>
<i>will receive a lifetime supply</i>
<i>of NYX Cosmetics,</i>
<i>a one-of-a-kind trip</i>
<i>courtesy of ALandCHUCK.travel,</i>
<i>headline Logo's</i><span style="bodyStyle"> Drag Race</i><i> tour,</i>
<i>featuring Absolut Vodka--</i>
<i>cocktails perfected--</i>
<i>and a cash prize of $100,000.</i>
And may the best woman win.
[tires squealing]
<i>- Cheesecake.</i>
both: Cheesecake.
- Cluck, cluck, queens.
- My baby's gone.
[wailing] My baby's gone.
- Aww.
-<i> All of my girls are gone.</i>
<i>This is the real deal.</i>
If you're not on top
of your Ps and your Qs,
you'll be X'd.
- "Stay true to you. XOXO."
Princess, what was it like
to lip-sync for your life?
- I just had fun with it.
If this is the last time
I'm on the stage,
I'm gonna soak it up.
Being in the bottom two
was ridiculously awful.
all: Awww!
-<i> So I need to step it up</i>
<i>a little bit more.</i>
Peace out.
- The bitch could sew.
- She sure could.
- She was very talented.
- Well, she's gone now.
- Man your stations.
- [laughs]
- Do you think you deserve
to be in the bottom?
- No.
- Who do you think deserved
to be in the bottom?
- Jiggly.
I think if I were to do it over,
after the comment
that you said...
- The thing is,
Princess is very Zen.
She's very quiet.
We needed to be, like,
crazy bitches.
- I probably would go back
and say, "Jiggly can go."
- Now, would you just say that
because she said something, or--
- Fuck yeah.
[siren blares]
all: Ooh.
- Yeah.
<i>- You've got shemail.</i>
Listen up, glamazons.
America's next drag superstar
is no one-hit wonder.
So if you want to live forever,
you've got to be a champion.
And with a little bit of love,
even a ladyboy
can be a cover girl.
And for the record,
those are all available
on iTunes.
[laughter]
[cheers and applause]
Hello, hello, hello.
all: Hi!
[cheers]
- Ladies, for today's
mini-challenge,
we're gonna do a little
something different.
We're gonna do something
for someone else.
- Oh.
- Imagine that.
Now, I love making music.
And I'm honored whenever anyone
makes an online video
of one of my songs.
But there's one in particular
that really moved me.
And I want to share it with you.
[RuPaul's<i> If I Dream]</i>
That's Piyah Martell.
She was born
with caudal regression syndrome
that prevented her legs
from growing.
That hasn't stopped her
from dreaming big.
Piyah's always wanted to be
a part of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race,</i>
and I've invited her here today.
Oh, pit crew.
[cheers and applause]
- All right, diva!
All right, Mama.
Diva!
- Hello, my darling.
Mwah, mwah.
- [giggles]
- Now, Piyah, honey.
You were delivering such
Mariah Carey realness
in that video.
[laughter]
You really captured that song.
- If you really do believe
in something,
you can't give up, you know?
If you dream and dream,
one day, it can happen.
- Piyah just went
right to my heart.
To see her pursuing her dreams,
it was very inspiring.
- Our mini-challenge today
is inspired by you.
Ladies, Piyah has an online
following,
and she calls her fans
butterflies.
You're gonna create
a fashion-forward headpiece
that Piyah can wear
in her next video
with these colorful butterflies.
So, ladies, you need to pair up,
so pick a partner.
All right, so there's
an odd number of queens,
so that leaves Jiggly all alone.
Jiggly, you get to pick
which pair you'd like to join.
- [chuckles]
- Hell no.
- The pretty girls.
- [laughing]
- Say it again.
- Now, you've got 20 minutes.
Ready. Set.
Go.
- Run!
Give me that!
- Ooh, yeah.
- Oh, that's gorgeous.
Now we're cookin'.
- Jiggly, just get that done.
- This one's for Piyah, baby.
-<i> Okay, ladies.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
- Ugh, shit.
-<i> Time's up.</i>
- You just have to hold it.
- Yeah, I know.
- Let's see what you crafty
caterpillars have come up with.
The first headpiece is from
Milan and Latrice Royale.
- The basis of making
the headdress
is to make sure
that you can actually wear it.
- Yes.
- We failed.
-<i> From the house</i>
<i>of Sharon Needles</i>
<i>and Madame LaQueer.</i>
- Yes.
- It's very royal wedding.
- Pop a little veil on there,
and you're ready for a funeral.
[laughter]
-<i> From the house</i>
<i>of Chad Michaels and Willam,</i>
<i>very tasteful number there.</i>
Is it fly, girl?
- Don't be trying to mop it.
- From the house of Dida Ritz
and The Princess.
I could see Mariah Carey
selling this on HSN.
[laughter]
And last and certainly
not least,
<i>from the house of</i>
<i>Phi Phi O'Hara, Kenya Michaels,</i>
and Jiggly Caliente,
it's a butterfly extravaganza!
- So we wanted something
that was gonna be
as big and as beautiful
as her spirit
and represent her as a whole.
- Love it.
So I will consult
with the client.
Tell me, dahling.
Okay. All right.
And the winner of this
mini-challenge is...
Phi Phi, Kenya, and Jiggly.
[cheers and applause]
<i>Let's see how it looks</i>
<i>on Piyah.</i>
- [growling]
Beautiful.
- Gorgeous.
<i>- Ow!</i>
[cheers and applause]
- Piyah, your ride is here
to pick you up
like the queen that you are.
<i>Thank you, darling.</i>
-<i> Thank you.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
- Beautiful.
-<i> We can't wait to see</i>
<i>your next video.</i>
Music makes the people
come together.
<i>For this week's main challenge,</i>
you'll be producing and starring
in infomercials
<i>for my albums</i><span style="bodyStyle"> Champion</i>
<i>and</i><span style="bodyStyle"> Glamazon.</i>
You'll need to sell each song
based on a personal memory,
<i>like your first kiss</i>
<i>or your first time in drag.</i>
Phi Phi, Kenya, and Jiggly,
you won the mini-challenge.
<i>But, Phi Phi and Kenya,</i>
<i>you won the coin toss,</i>
<i>so you two will be</i>
<i>team captains.</i>
Phi Phi, you are Team<i> Champion.</i>
<i>Kenya, you're Team</i><span style="bodyStyle"> Glamazon.</i>
All right, Kenya,
pick a queen.
- Chad Michaels.
- Phi Phi, your turn.
- Sharon Needles.
- Yes, ma'am, Phi Phi.
- I'm not dumb.
[snickers]
- Miss Willam.
- Dida Ritz.
- Milan.
- Latrice the beast.
<i>[growls]</i>
- Princess.
-<i> All right, two queens left,</i>
<i>Jiggly and Madame LaQueer.</i>
- Jiggly, get your butt
over here.
- [giggling]
-<i> Again I got picked last.</i>
I thought that Kenya was going
to go through for me.
- And that means Madame LaQueer
is Team<i> Glamazon.</i>
- Oh.
- Going up.
- I gave a hand.
She rejected it.
- [grunts]
-<i> So are the people</i>
<i>going to see</i>
<i>that the Puerto Rican girls</i>
<i>in the competition</i>
<i>does not help each other?</i>
That's sad.
That is very sad.
- Ladies, my entire recording
career is in your hands.
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best...
seller win.
- I want us each to have
a completely different look.
<i>I want to appeal to everybody.</i>
I want to be completely ghetto.
Can you do, like, gospel?
- Yeah.
- I could be very girly.
- Okay, you know what?
I'm gonna be honest with you.
You've done girly every time
that you've tried to do
something.
I don't want you to do girly.
Can you do, like, club kid?
- Yeah, I could do that.
- I'm kind of channeling, like,
my character being a housewife.
- I want you to look
very Stepford wife.
I want you as, like--
as gothic as can be.
I think you doing your
goth thing would be perfect.
-<i> As much as I love being</i>
<i>a horror character,</i>
as a drag queen, there is
a million looks inside me.
- Boom. Boom.
- Our challenge today
is to make a infomercial
to sell RuPaul's albums
<i>Glamazon</i><span style="bodyStyle"> and</i><i> Champion.</i>
I have a killer pimple,
and I did not know this.
<i>So we had to make testimonials</i>
<i>depending on which song</i>
<i>we were assigned.</i>
<i>We had to have choreographed</i>
<i>dance, make costumes.</i>
Do you have any
plastic necklaces?
- Um, I have, like,
one turquoise one.
You want it?
-<i> Oh, no. No, no, no, no.</i>
It has to be, like, darker.
<i>Each team got assigned</i>
<i>a different album.</i>
<i>So we got</i><span style="bodyStyle"> Champion.</i>
Are you guys gonna start
getting ready or not?
- Well, do you want to start
doing choreography
and everything?
- Oh, yeah, we have to do
our choreography.
Fucking shit.
- Girl.
- It's only a little snippet.
- Have you listened to it?
- Oh.
-<i> It's every song off the album.</i>
-<i> Yeah.</i>
- An hour and a half
to do choreography,
plus do the costumes,
plus pick our pictures
and memorize this song
and do a dance?
- Mm-hmm.
- Ugh.
God!
- Get into it, girl.
Get into it.
- We can't do this.
We can't let this break us.
Come on.
-<i> Phi Phi is the team leader.</i>
<i>Definitely, there was a lot</i>
<i>of pressure.</i>
We say the captain goes down
with the ship.
-<i> Do y'all's face, like,</i>
<i>super fast,</i>
<i>so that way, we can rehearse</i>
<i>afterwards.</i>
- Can everybody be painted
in 30 minutes?
- In 30?
- Mm-hmm.
- Just put some white powder
on your face and look gothic.
That's all we need you to do.
-<i> Phi Phi wants to call me goth</i>
and wants to push me
into one small box,
which is a box she knows
nothing about.
- [gasps]
Oh, Jiggly!
You should do<i> Ladyboy</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
and do a whole Asian theme.
<i>And then you can wear</i>
<i>my red bob.</i>
-<i> Okay.</i>
- So hurry up and get painted
and just look super Asian.
Oh, so don't put any makeup on.
-<i> Stupid.</i>
-<i> I just felt like I was</i>
<i>in the team of the busted.</i>
And I wanted to be
in the team of the dusted.
- Okay, so what we need to do
is come up with a theme.
- Maybe we try to put<i> Glamazon--</i>
our animals, our fears, costume
to that first and--
- Yeah, but because
of our time frame,
we got to make sure
that everybody
can get something
that's universal.
Let's just decide to go on '80s.
<i>I think we all knew that Kenya</i>
<i>had a language barrier.</i>
So I decided to take control of
that situation and help Kenya.
- We have to pick
our individual backgrounds
for our individual performance.
- Okay, great.
Can you find humor in that?
You know what I'm saying? Like--
- In clouds?
- Yeah.
- Kenya is supposed to be
the team leader,
but Milan is stepping in,
and I'm sorry.
I don't think
it's the language barrier.
- '80s is about this.
You know, it's about this.
It's about, "Ha, ha, ha."
- The first position
for the<i> Superstar.</i>
What is the first position?
- It's, um...
- And next--next--
- Let me sing through it.
I'll try to sing
as much as I can.
-<i> Milan kept talking over Kenya.</i>
- Maybe I--
- Hold on, hold on, hold on.
Hold on, hold on.
- It's getting old.
It's getting real damn old.
- Hello, hello, hello.
- Hi, RuPaul.
all: Hi!
- I want to know how my
infomercials are coming along.
- Come, Mother, come.
- Well, hello, Team<i> Glamazon.</i>
- Hi, RuPaul.
- Hi, Ru.
- Hi.
- Willam, what song
are you gonna do?
- I get to do<i> Click Clack.</i>
- And you're a shoe queen,
aren't you?
- I brought 34 pairs of shoes.
- [mouthing words]
- I have some great '80s shoes.
- Is the whole group
dressing '80s?
- Yes.
- So, Captain Kenya,
how did you decide on '80s?
- Personally speaking, I think,
as you listen to the album,
there's some '80s influence
going on.
We wanted to try to stay true
to the essence
and the influence of the album.
- Kenya?
Who is in charge here?
<i>Is it you or Milan?</i>
- We decided to share it.
- Yeah.
- Because, you know,
of the language barrier.
- Right.
-<i> I think that Milan</i>
<i>talked too much.</i>
The English is not
my first language.
<i>But I'm trying.</i>
- Princess, you've been known
here on the show
as sort of the quiet one,
the Zen one.
- Right, right.
- How are you gonna
put it all out there?
- I think I just haven't been
given the opportunity
to do that.
- Well, I don't know about that.
We've given you
a few opportunities.
You have an opportunity
right now to do it.
-<i> It just sucks to hear</i>
<i>that criticism,</i>
when I've been giving it
my 100%.
<i>It just boggles my mind.</i>
- Well, well, well.
Team<i> Champion.</i>
all: Hi, Ru.
- Phi Phi, you're captain again.
- I am captain again.
- How'd that happen?
- I'm just amazing.
-<i> You are amazing.</i>
- [giggles]
- So, Sharon Needles,
what song are you gonna do?
- I'm going to be doing
<i>Cover Girl.</i>
-<i> Cover Girl?</i>
<i>- Mm-hmm.</i>
I'm going to be pitching it
to an alternative audience
who might think your music is,
uh, too dancy.
- Wait a minute.
Ex-squeeze me?
- Well, it is very dancy,
but it also, you know,
has other elements to it
that I think works
for all audiences.
- Uh-huh.
Dida.
What song are you doing?
- I'm doing Stepford wife
dancing to RuPaul's<i> Main Event.</i>
And when she hears this song,
it reminds her of the fun
that she had.
- Ah.
So maybe she was a<i> Solid Gold</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
dancer in another life?
- Maybe; maybe she was one of
a pole dancer back in the day.
- [laughing]
- Jiggly Caliente,
some of your teammates
gave you a little shade
on the runway last week.
Why do you think so many people
chose you as the person
who should go home?
- Probably because they still
<i>don't understand everything</i>
<i>about me.</i>
They'll have to get
to know me first.
- When will they get
to know you?
In this competition, if you
really want to really go for it,
it's not something to do
with anybody else.
It's got to come from yourself.
I want to ask,
have you guys had time
to work on your
group number yet?
- No, we haven't.
- We wanted to paint first.
- Oh, dear.
Are you a little worried
about the group number?
- No, we're not worried.
- I am.
-<i> Okay.</i>
- We looked like fucking idiots.
<i>It was embarrassing to me.</i>
- You don't want to get clocked
by RuPaul.
You don't want to get clocked
by Supermodel.
You don't.
You don't.
- All right, you all need
all the time
you can get your hands on.
Now, I'm gonna let you all
get to it, okay?
- Thank you, Ru.
- All right, bye.
<i>Ladies, gather round.</i>
Remember, you need to connect
with the TV audience.
<i>Make 'em laugh.</i>
<i>Sell some product.</i>
And pitch your heart out.
Oh, and one more thing.
Don't fuck it up!
<i>Okay.</i>
<i>- Amen.</i>
- Bye, Ru.
- Bye, Ru.
- Bye, Ru.
- Here they are, Team<i> Glamazon.</i>
-<i> The infomercial challenge</i>
<i>is kind of daunting</i>
because we're doing
lots of different segments.
<i>There's different outfits</i>
<i>to think about.</i>
- We have props for you
if you like.
There's some Iron Fist shoes
which I designed,
<i>and the pit crew</i>
<i>is also included.</i>
You just got to return 'em
when you're done.
[laughter]
-<i> We're shooting the opening</i>
<i>scene of the infomercial.</i>
<i>Our team looks phenomenal</i>
<i>in our '80s looks.</i>
And we are so ready to do it.
We're gonna do amazing.
-<i> All right, here we go.</i>
Action.
[tango music]
- Do the line.
Do the lines.
-<i> Cut.</i>
Now, I know you flubbed
a little bit,
<i>but that's okay;</i>
<i>that's okay.</i>
Just keep on going.
- Hey, Chad.
Is that RuPaul's<i> Glamazon?</i>
- Oh, my God.
It takes me so far back.
- RuPaul's music--
Oh, fuck.
Order all your favorites
and hits now.
The pit crew is standing by.
- Uh, you read the--
the line wrong.
- Yeah, it's "Order now."
- Order now.
- "Get all your favorite hits.
<i>The pit crew is standing by."</i>
- Nobody gets their line right
the first time.
Order now, and other
favorite hits.
The pit crew is standing by.
- All right, who's up next?
<i>You tell me when you're ready.</i>
- [sniffs]
I'm ready.
- Action.
[synthesizer solo]
<i>Milan is up next.</i>
- Before I listened to RuPaul's
<i>Superstar,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> I was so emotional.</i>
But after listening to it,
I found out that the greatest
love of all is inside of me.
[sudden silence]
-<i> You know, that's another</i>
<i>artist, actually.</i>
-<i> I was gonna say, but you're</i>
<i>pitching Whitney there.</i>
-<i> Any bitch with common sense</i>
<i>knows you don't channel</i>
<i>Whitney Houston</i>
in a RuPaul infomercial.
- Thanks, Whitney.
We'll call you later.
<i>Look at you.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
- She got bones.
-<i> [laughs]</i>
No, these are just bones
from some, uh--
-<i> A leopardasaurus.</i>
- Yeah, some Roberto Cavalli
animal or something.
-<i> Yes, from a yacht.</i>
-<i> Yes. Love it.</i>
<i>All right, here we go.</i>
Action.
Yeah, cut.
<i>All right, Team</i><span style="bodyStyle"> Champion.</i>
<i>Phi Phi O'Hara.</i>
<i>She got a 40-ounce.</i>
Girl from the 6 train.
- Now it's our team's turn
to do the infomercial
to sell RuPaul's album<i> Champion.</i>
- And...action.
Cut.
<i>Give it all you got this time.</i>
And...action.
-<i> I feel amazing</i>
<i>during the shoot.</i>
<i>Ru's laughing.</i>
<i>Michelle's laughing.</i>
I'm giving 'em, you know,
Phi Phi fierce the house down.
<i>Action.</i>
- When I first heard<i> Ladyboy,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
my madam said,
"That's not soy sauce
in your panties."
- Cut.
It's not what in your panties?
- Soy sauce.
- Oh.
<i>Sell it.</i>
<i>You got to sell it, okay?</i>
But that was--
that's--that's good.
- "That is not soy sauce
in your panties.
"That is happy endings.
Semen."
- [laughing]
Oh, my God.
- Sorry.
- Action.
- When I first heard
RuPaul's<i> Cover Girl,</i>
I was covered in blood.
I was slaughtering
a sacrificial lamb.
- Cut.
The thing here is,
if it's supposed to be funny,
<i>make it funny.</i>
<i>Let's do one more.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
- Sure.
Phi Phi told me to do
just my spooky shtick.
<i>But they're just not really</i>
<i>getting it.</i>
-<i> You have one take left.</i>
Make it work for you, okay?
- Okay.
Though I may dabble
in the black arts,
when I hear RuPaul's music,
I see the light.
-<i> Cut.</i>
- [sighs]
This is a mess.
- One day, I was home making
a warm apple pie for my husband,
and<i> Main Event</i><span style="bodyStyle"> came on</i>
by RuPaul.
It reminds me of the main event
that happens in the bedroom
with my husband.
- So you're making a--
a sexual innuendo there.
- No.
-<i> I think you've got to sell</i>
<i>that a little bit more.</i>
- It reminded me
of the main event
that I was gonna get later
with my husband.
-<i> Cut.</i>
I like to go as far as possible
and have the director
pull me back.
-<i> Okay.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
- You know?
- Okay.
This is bad.
I'm feeling nervous.
I'm feeling scared.
<i>I'm really screwing this up</i>
<i>right now in front of RuPaul.</i>
It reminded me of the main event
that was gonna happen later on
with my husband.
[giggles]
-<i> Okay, cut.</i>
<i>We'll see you on the flip side.</i>
[alarm buzzing]
- All right,<i> Mami.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
Elimination day.
- Come on.
- No!
- I'm so nervous about today.
- Why are you nervous?
- Because I was terrible.
I'm just shaking in my boots
right now
and preparing myself
for the worst.
I just felt like I was working
with a whole bunch of amateurs.
- Sharon's scared because now
he's in the same boat
as all of us
and he doesn't have immunity.
- And the only reason
why he's scared
is 'cause he didn't steal
the show.
- I stole the show!
<i>I don't want to stress out</i>
<i>anymore</i>
<i>worrying about what Sharon</i>
<i>thinks of me.</i>
<i>I picked a character for her</i>
<i>that she can excel in.</i>
She has one good character,
so she might as well use it.
Bitch, shut the fuck up.
This is my team.
- Right.
- I feel like
I'm in high school.
"Can I sit by you?"
-<i> So have you met</i>
<i>your boyfriend's parents?</i>
- Never. Yeah, we've never met
each other's parents.
<i>It's like, our parents</i>
<i>don't mind that we're gay,</i>
<i>but it's like, they still don't</i>
<i>look at it as a real family.</i>
- My family was not very pleased
when they found out
that I did drag.
Not everybody.
Some people are very supportive.
Like, my mom and my stepdad
are amazing.
<i>They're absolutely supportive.</i>
Other people in my family are
not so thrilled with it.
My dad found out
I was doing drag.
He wrote me a letter and said,
"You're an embarrassment
to the family.
Change your name.
Move far away."
Basically didn't want any
contact with me whatsoever.
It's tough when people
that you love
don't agree
with what you're doing.
- It sucks. It sucks.
I haven't spoken to my parents
in I don't know how long,
really,
<i>and they don't know I'm here.</i>
- Wait, they don't even know
you're here?
- I come from a very, you know,
religious background.
<i>I don't know if they're</i>
<i>gonna be proud of me.</i>
<i>I don't know if they're</i>
<i>gonna be embarrassed by me.</i>
I just feel like my family
just doesn't understand
<i>the fact that I do what I do,</i>
<i>and it's kind of put</i>
this distance between us.
I never make an effort to even
try to pick up the phone
and call them
because I don't like to go home.
- We both lost our mom just,
you know, four years ago,
and tomorrow's not promised.
Just don't put that wall up,
because you will regret it.
And I have to live with the fact
that I didn't see my mom
for over ten years.
- I don't want to, like,
get this phone call that, like,
something has happened
and know that, like, the last--
the last, like, time
I spoke to my mother
was--you know,
and how my feelings were.
- You only have one family.
-<i> [laughing]</i>
[applause]
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Ru.
-<i> Hey, gorgeous.</i>
- Hey.
- Whoo!
- Michelle Visage.
Hi, Mama.
- Hi, baby. How are you?
-<i> Great.</i>
I can see that you're
broadcasting in stereo tonight.
- Is there any other way?
- [chuckles]
<i>Hey, Santino.</i>
Or--or should I say<i> shalom?</i>
- Ha, ha.<i> Shalom.</i>
- How about the beautiful
and talented Amber Riley?
Welcome.
- Thank you.
I'm so excited to be here.
- We're excited to have you.
I'm a big Gleek.
- [laughs]
- And nine-time
Grammy award-winning artist
<i>Miss Natalie Cole.</i>
- Hello, love.
- This will be unforgettable.
- It already is.
- Good.
This week, our queens
produced and starred
in TV infomercials
to sell my greatest hits.
And tonight, they're ready
to take a spin down the runway
in platinum and gold.
Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best woman win.
London, Paris...
Milan.
- Solid Gold<i> dancer.</i>
-<i> Darcel, her name was.</i>
-<i> And Altovise Davis, honey.</i>
-<i> I'm going for the gold, baby.</i>
<i>Jackie Joyner-Kersee</i>
<i>has nothing on me.</i>
-<i> She's gonna make your wishes</i>
<i>come true.</i>
-<i> You work it, girl. Work it.</i>
-<i> Ow.</i>
-<i> Harem scarem, Miss Thing.</i>
<i>Ooh.</i>
<i>Miss Chad Michaels.</i>
-<i> It's Jem and the Holograms.</i>
-<i> Fabulous.</i>
Solid Gold.
-<i> I just had the idea</i>
<i>to paint my forehead gold</i>
<i>and really try to emulate</i>
<i>the Versace medallion,</i>
<i>the Medusa head.</i>
-<i> Live from Caesars Palace.</i>
<i>- Okay.</i>
-<i> The price of gold has just</i>
<i>gone up, hasn't it?</i>
-<i> Ooh, yes, it has.</i>
<i>Wow.</i>
<i>Willam. Glamazon.</i>
-<i> Break these chains.</i>
-<i> My goodness.</i>
<i>Chain, chain, chain.</i>
-<i> My theme was</i>
Clash of the Titans,
<i>if</i><span style="bodyStyle"> Clash of the Titans</i>
<i>was set in a strip club.</i>
-<i> Oh, look, Willam's</i>
<i>a little cheeky tonight.</i>
-<i> Yes, I think I could see</i>
<i>her pink Cadillac.</i>
[laughter]
<i>All right, Sharon Needles.</i>
<i>She's Greased Lightning.</i>
-<i> Serving T-bird.</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>
-<i> Cha Cha Digregorio's</i>
<i>got nothing on us.</i>
-<i> I'm not afraid</i>
<i>to look bizarre,</i>
<i>and when I look bizarre,</i>
<i>I feel beautiful.</i>
-<i> She's serving Elvis</i>
<i>and Elvira.</i>
<i>She's Elvirus.</i>
<i>And it's contagious.</i>
<i>Oh, Phi Phi O'Hara. Yes.</i>
-<i> Vanessa Williams right here.</i>
-<i> Yes, yes.</i>
-<i> Sparkle, Phi Phi. Sparkle.</i>
-<i> I love my look.</i>
<i>My hair kind of looks swooped</i>
<i>like an ice cream cone.</i>
<i>Trying to serve the judges</i>
<i>Beyoncé-meets-the-Jetsons</i>
<i>realness.</i>
-<i> She's serving Jiffy Pop</i>
<i>after the show.</i>
-<i> Okay.</i>
-<i> Madame LaQueer.</i>
-<i> Cut it out.</i>
-<i> [laughing]</i>
-<i> Yes, she is serving</i>
<i>some space couture.</i>
<i>Yes, Mama.</i>
-<i> I'm going with</i>
<i>an outer space look,</i>
<i>and it's good because</i>
<i>I like to be different.</i>
-<i> Space: the final LaQueer.</i>
<i>The Princess.</i>
-<i> Uh-oh.</i>
-<i> Wait--uh--what?</i>
<i>- Uh--</i>
- She stole my look.
<i>Who wore it best?</i>
-<i> I like showing off my body,</i>
<i>my curves,</i>
<i>with an element of androgyny.</i>
<i>I definitely think it's a bold</i>
<i>choice to go without a wig.</i>
-<i> Bold is beautiful.</i>
-<i> Yes, it is.</i>
<i>Look at that ass.</i>
-<i> I'm telling you.</i>
-<i> Your ass is mince, Princess.</i>
-<i> [laughing]</i>
-<i> Jiggly Caliente.</i>
<i>Serving heavy gunmetal chick.</i>
-<i> There's an asteroid headed</i>
<i>straight for planet Ru.</i>
-<i> Uh-oh. Duck and cover.</i>
-<i> The look is right.</i>
<i>Catch my shades.</i>
<i>I look sick.</i>
-<i> I said wild women do.</i>
- Amen.
-<i> [laughing]</i>
-<i> And they don't regret it.</i>
-<i> No.</i>
<i>Dida Ritz.</i>
<i>Oh, runway realness.</i>
<i>Supermodel.</i>
-<i> Look at these legs.</i>
<i>I'm pummeling the runway.</i>
<i>I am serving Naomi Campbell</i>
<i>realness.</i>
-<i> Oh, and what an impressive</i>
<i>bumper she has.</i>
-<i> And she ain't afraid</i>
<i>to show it.</i>
-<i> No.</i>
<i>- Not at all.</i>
-<i> Latrice Royale.</i>
<i>There's gold</i>
<i>in them there hills.</i>
-<i> [laughing]</i>
-<i> I want this short little dress</i>
<i>to show off my gorgeous legs</i>
<i>and hips and curves.</i>
<i>Body beautiful, of course.</i>
-<i> 24-karat realness.</i>
-<i> Yes.</i>
<i>I'll have a Latrice Royale</i>
<i>on the rocks.</i>
<i>Shaken, not stirred.</i>
<i>Kenya Michaels.</i>
<i>She's serving</i>
<i>some R2-D2 realness.</i>
<i>"C-3P-ho."</i>
-<i> I tried to mix the high</i>
<i>couture with the fantasy.</i>
<i>I feel amazing.</i>
-<i> In space, no one can hear you,</i>
<i>queen.</i>
-<i> [laughing]</i>
- Welcome, ladies.
<i>It's time to debut your</i>
<i>RuCo Records infomercials.</i>
Let's start with Team<i> Glamazon.</i>
- Hey, Chad.
Is that RuPaul's<i> Glamazon?</i>
- Like, oh, my God, wow.
That takes me so far back.
- RuPaul's music brings back
so many good memories.
It's hard to choose just one.
- You know what, Princess?
Luckily, you don't have to.
Oh, my God!
- Before I listened
to<i> Superstar,</i>
I was totally spastic.
But now that I listened to it,
I feel totally tubular.
- [Hispanic accent]
Hello,<i> Papi.</i>
I don't speak very much English.
[speaking Spanish]
<i>Y</i><span style="bodyStyle"> trust me.</i>
Do you remember your first time?
- Oh, my God, you guys.
The first time I heard
RuPaul's song<i> The Beginning,</i>
I was spray painting
my ex-boyfriend's car
with vulgarities.
What a jerk.
That was the beginning
of an awesome
and gnarly new life for me.
- When you are in a competition
that no one speaks Spanish,
you think,<i> "Mierda,</i>
<i>no entiendo nada."</i>
But in that moment,
awake the beast.
Get your rebel on, and fight.
- Wearing high heels
was getting so ho-hum
until I heard<i> Click Clack.</i>
Now it's the soundtrack
to my life.
- Do you feel like you've come
to the end of your road?
At one time, I did too,
until I heard
RuPaul's<i> If I Dream.</i>
And now I know anything
is possible.
- Order now.
Get all your favorite hits.
The pit crew is standing by.
all: Get<i> Glamazon</i><span style="bodyStyle"> on Amazon.</i>
Whoo-hoo!
-<i> [laughing]</i>
<i>Ahh.</i>
<i>[Valley girl voice]</i>
<i>Oh, my God, you guys.</i>
Gag me with a spoon.
-<i> I think our team nailed it.</i>
<i>Perfect. Awesome.</i>
I don't think we could've done
anything better.
- Now let's watch the
infomercial for Team<i> Champion.</i>
[upbeat dance music]
- Hey, Vampira.
Isn't this, like, this, like,
uh, RuPaul<i> Champion</i><span style="bodyStyle"> album</i>
or somethin'?
- Oh, RuPaul's music
always brings me back.
- You know what, girl?
Like, there's so many songs
that, like, have so many
good memories
that it's hard to, like,
pick one, you know, Mamas?
- Luckily, now we don't have to.
[laughs wickedly]
- When I first heard<i> Ladyboy,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
my madam said,
"That's not soy sauce
in your panties."
- One day, I was home making
a warm apple pie for my husband,
and then<i> Main Event</i><span style="bodyStyle"> came on</i>
by RuPaul.
It reminded me of the main event
that I was gonna get later
with my husband.
- Children, when I heard
RuPaul's<i> Never Go Home Again,</i>
I know that there was something
out there better waiting for me.
- So look.
Every time I'm walking
down the street,
all these<i> mamis</i><span style="bodyStyle"> are like, "Ooh,</i>
girl, your ass is too fat."
I'm like, "Look, don't be
jealous of my boogie."
- When I heard RuPaul's
<i>Cover Girl</i><span style="bodyStyle"> for the first time,</i>
I was covered in blood.
And though I may dabble
in the black arts,
when I hear RuPaul's music,
I see the light.
all: Available on iTunes.
Whoo!
[loud cheers and laughter]
- That was dragnificent, ladies.
If I were watching back at home,
I would place my order
right now.
I mean, really.
Do it now.
<i>All right, ladies.</i>
<i>You produced</i>
<i>your infomercials as teams.</i>
But tonight, you'll be judged
as individuals.
When I call your name,
please step forward.
Milan.
Willam.
Latrice Royale.
Jiggly Caliente.
Phi Phi O'Hara.
This week, you did not reach
the top of the charts.
You are safe.
You may leave the stage.
Ladies, you represent
this week's hits and flops.
And now it's time
to face the music.
Madame LaQueer.
- Hello.<i> Hola.</i>
- Let's go to Natalie Cole.
- I love your essence.
But I don't like the outfit.
- When I hear gold and platinum,
I think classier.
<i>The color green reminds me</i>
<i>of fungus.</i>
<i>In the video in the pitch,</i>
little bit too much Spanish,
so remember that.
- I think you were being true
to yourself, though,
with the Spanish.
<i>It was really funny.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
- Thank you.
- But I think that that's a
place where you're comfortable.
I would encourage you to kind of
push yourself a little bit.
- Next up, Chad Michaels.
- Hi, Ru.
- I think you're
an amazing actress.
I thought it was just
the right amount of trashy,
<i>tongue-in-cheek.</i>
- You do everything flawlessly
from beginning to end.
It's obvious.
I want to see you let go
of that perfection.
I want to see more
of who you are.
- Princess.
Love the look.
- Thank you.
- Your hosting skills
weren't really
at the same level
as Chad Michaels'.
- You were extremely flat.
We've told this to you before.
You've got to be aware
of going above and beyond
<i>and out of your comfort zone.</i>
You in particular, Princess.
- Kenya Michaels.
- Hi.
- You come out here
in this directional ensemble.
<i>I was just, like,</i>
<i>following every curve.</i>
- I really loved
your performance.
It was so sick
that it was right.
-<i> Thanks, Kenya.</i>
Dida Ritz.
-<i> Hey, Dida.</i>
I love your ensemble tonight.
<i>Your body is amazing.</i>
I wondered why you chose
<i>the character you played</i>
<i>in the video.</i>
-<i> I wanted to do</i>
<i>something different.</i>
Tall, leggy, sexy Dida
is kind of something
that I don't want
to get comfortable doing.
- It's good that you did
take a risk,
<i>but you looked uncomfortable,</i>
<i>and if you're gonna</i>
do something out of your
comfort zone,
you have to commit to it.
- Next up, Sharon Needles.
<i>Tell me about your</i>
<i>infomercial presentation.</i>
Did you work well with Phi Phi?
- She definitely didn't bring
a strong leadership role.
<i>Basically, what she said is,</i>
<i>"You're spooky.</i>
Dress like a monster."
But I used it as a way
to sell your records.
- Well, you do spooky very well.
- Boo.
- [whimpering]
- I didn't even get
the name right away.
[laughter]
It just went whoop,
right over my head.
- All in the past, Miss Cole.
- Okay.
You know, so I'm right there
with you, but anyway.
- Well, yes, um--
- [laughing]
-<i> The presentation was eerie</i>
<i>and all that you wanted it</i>
<i>to be.</i>
<i>It kind of freaked me out</i>
<i>a little bit.</i>
I really liked it.
-<i> I love that Swarovski crystal</i>
<i>pompadour you got on.</i>
But I wish I couldn't see
the lower half of your body.
It kind of looks like
a store-bought thing.
-<i> Well, ladies, I think</i>
<i>we've heard enough.</i>
While you enjoy
an Absolut cocktail
in the Interior Illusions
Lounge,
<i>the judges and I</i>
<i>will deliberate.</i>
You may leave the stage.
All right, just between
us girls, who is your favorite?
- I go with personality.
-<i> Yeah.</i>
-<i> I think that Sharon Needles</i>
<i>has got a great sense of humor.</i>
-<i> Uh-huh.</i>
- For me, it's between
Sharon Needles
and Kenya Michaels.
<i>I really like Kenya.</i>
She has less of a handle
on the English language,
but she was able to just
push through it
and just have fun.
- Yes.
She sold it.
It was from the heart.
You felt that she wanted
to bring out the inner beast
and get her rebel on.
- Chad is my absolute favorite.
<i>She's so glam and so seasoned.</i>
I couldn't keep my eyes off her.
<i>I just kept staring at her</i>
<i>the whole time.</i>
-<i> Okay.</i>
Now, here is the hard part.
Who are the bottom two?
- You know, I would kind of
have to say
<i>Princess and Madame LaQueer.</i>
- Princess and Madame LaQueer.
And why?
-<i> Madame LaQueer, she's just</i>
<i>not quite ready for prime time.</i>
And although Miss Princess' look
is great,
we're talking about bringing
people that are gonna win...
- Yes.
- Because they're already
so close.
I don't think she's that close.
- The Princess--I'm getting
nothing from her.
I think I'd like to see more
from Madame LaQueer.
She's a fierce queen.
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna have to say Dida.
<i>I just don't know.</i>
<i>I'm confused by her 'cause</i>
<i>the walk on the runway--</i>
That walk is saying,
"I am here. I am fierce."
<i>But the video--</i>
<i>I think Dida thought</i>
<i>that the costume</i>
<i>was gonna do the work for her.</i>
- Right, I don't think
she understands
<i>that that walk that she</i>
<i>displays on the runway</i>
can be transferred
into every challenge,
into her everyday life.
- I like to see people
who are the shit
and know they're the shit.
No apologies.
-<i> Mm-hmm.</i>
- No apologies.
- All right.
Silence.
<i>I've made my decision.</i>
Bring back...
my girls.
Welcome back, ladies.
I've made some decisions.
Sharon Needles.
You went to the dark side...
<i>again...</i>
and delivered another
sparkling performance.
Condragulations.
- Yes!
-<i> You're the winner</i>
<i>of this challenge.</i>
- Atta girl.
-<i> And you'll receive</i>
<i>costume jewelry</i>
<i>courtesy of</i>
<i>fiercedragjewels.com.</i>
- Who won the main challenge
this week?
Oh, yeah, me.
Again.
<i>Like a nightmare come true.</i>
<i>Ha, ha.</i>
I'm just such a loser back home.
It's--or that's
how I'm perceived,
and it's just great
to hear you say that.
<i>Thanks.</i>
- Sharon, you may step
to the back of the stage.
- Thank you.
- Chad Michaels, Kenya Michaels,
you're safe.
<i>Madame LaQueer...</i>
You're safe.
<i>Dida Ritz.</i>
<i>The Princess.</i>
I'm sorry, my dears,
but you are both up
for elimination.
- Not again.
-<i> It's kind of upsetting</i>
because I felt like
I put myself there.
-<i> Two queens stand before me.</i>
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me
and save yourself
from elimination.
The time has come...
for you to lip-sync
for your life.
<i>Good luck.</i>
And don't fuck it up.
<i>[This Will Be</i><span style="bodyStyle"> playing]</i>
-<i> Natalie Cole is sitting</i>
<i>right in front of me.</i>
<i>I have to do it for her.</i>
<i>I don't want her to leave</i>
<i>saying,</i>
<i>"That drag queen did</i>
<i>a horrible job with my song."</i>
- [laughing]
-<i> Yeah!</i>
-<i> Come on!</i>
Well!
Ah!
Whoo!
-<i> That is what a lip-sync</i>
<i>for your life is, baby.</i>
<i>That is high drag</i>
<i>at its finest.</i>
[cheers and applause]
- Wow.
That was amazing.
I've made my decision.
Dida Ritz...
shantay, you stay.
- Thank you.
- That's the queen I want to see
from now on.
From now on, queen.
From now on.
- I promise.
You may join the other girls.
- Thank you.
-<i> The Princess.</i>
Even though your time here
has been brief,
you will be forever
<i>Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> royalty.</i>
Long live The Princess.
- Thank you.
- Now sashay away.
[applause]
-<i> I'm not the type</i>
<i>to get upset or angry,</i>
but I don't think it was right
to send me home.
This competition will definitely
be missing something
not getting to see the rest
of what I had to offer.
- My top ten, condragulations.
And the hits
just keep on coming.
Now, if you can't love yourself,
how in the hell you gonna love
somebody else?
Can I get a amen up in here?
all: Amen!
- All right, now,
let the music play.


- Charisma.
Uniqueness.
Nerve.
Talent.
We've raised the bar on grace
and beauty so high
that now there's
only one place to go...
[drum roll]
[cheering]
[yelping]
Over...
the motherfucking...
top.
- Let's not get it twisted.
- Hold on, bitch.
[camera clicking]
- More booty.
- Welcome to Tuckahoe Prison
for Ladies.
- Hello.
[dog barking]
- More sassy stars.
- I don't know why they book me
on these chicken-shit Gigs.
[laughter]
- More drama.
- [speaking Spanish ]
- Get out.
- Your fake-ass hoe.
- All right,
you tired-ass showgirl.
- At least
I am a showgirl, bitch.
Go back to Party City,
where you belong.
- For the first time
in<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> history,</i>
and a finale,
we are breaking all the rules...
- Oh, my god.
- That will be the most
sickening ever.
- [gagging]
- Hey!
-<i> RuPaul's Drag Race...</i>
[laughter]
Is about to spin out of control.
- Pew, pew.
- In three...two...one...
- [snarls]
- [laughs]
My name's Willam.
I'm 29.
Ooh, a 26.
Damn, we got some big girls.
I hope they don't have diabetes.
I didn't come up
through the club system.
I'm an actor.
I've done TV, I've done film.
<i>Sex in the City, The District,</i>
<i>Criminal Minds,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
and a show that was, like,
a multi-story arc.
I think I'm
the skinniest one; yay!
I'm a successful drag queen,
and not some bitch
who has to show for a dollar.
Now no one else can have it.
- My name's Lashauwn Beyond.
I'm 21 years old.
Hi, queen one.
- Hi.
- Lashauwn Beyond is the main
attraction for the circus.
She just has a lot of fun.
- Your hair's too big
for the frickin' door.
- I know, right?
- Hi.
- What's good, ladies?
My name is Jiggly Caliente.
I'm 30 years old from Queens,
New York, baby.
Wow.
Jiggly Caliente is New York
City's plus-size Barbie.
She got swag for your nerve.
You can't take her.
You look really familiar, Mom.
- Me?
- Yeah.
Oh, now I know who you is.
- You must have a television.
- Oh, hell no, you didn't.
- Well, hello, hello.
- Hi.
- How are y'all doing?
- How are you?
- Good, wow.
- My name is Phi Phi O'Hara.
I am 25 years old.
Are you guys excited
for the first challenge?
- No, we're not.
- You're not excited?
- Duh, yeah.
- Oh.
- [laughs]
- Hiya.
- [shrieks]
- I am Madame LaQueer.
I'm 29 years old.
- Your lips are amazing.
-<i> Perra.</i>
- Thank you.
- Give 'em here.
"Per--"
What does that mean?
-<i> "Perra"</i><span style="bodyStyle"> is like saying,</i>
"Oh, bitch."
- Sickening.
- Oh.
I'm gonna learn Spanish
by the time I win.
- What?
- Huh?
- Hey, there's a new girl
in town.
Let's get to business.
- Broadway just hit our stage.
That, or they picked up
a pimp off the street.
- Cash or credit card?
- My name is Milan,
I'm 36 years old,
and I'm from New York City.
Hey! Oh, my gosh.
Milan is fierce.
She is fabulous, she's a diva,
she can act, sing, dance,
produce, and you don't want it
from her.
[laughs]
- Hi.
- Hello.
How y'all trannies doing?
- Hi.
- Hi, wow.
- My name is Alisa Summers,
I'm 23 years old,
and I'm from Tampa, Florida.
I am definitely a fishy queen.
I can walk down a street.
You know, I don't really
get clocked.
People are looking more so
at how big my titties
and ass are.
I'm ready, girl.
[cheering]
-<i> Bonjour,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> ladies.</i>
I'm Dida Ritz, I'm 25 years old,
and I'm from Chicago.
[screams]
Oh, my god, you're here!
Oh, my god.
Dida Ritz is--if you
think about Beyonce
and Carrie Bradshaw
and Kimora Simmons
and they all three got together
and somehow had a baby.
- Dida Ritz look a mess.
That dry-ass wig
and that awful-ass make up.
- Oh, my god.
- So we don't have any
backwoods girls yet, huh?
- Hello. Hi.
I'm the princess.
I'm 32 years old.
- You look sickening.
- Thank you.
I'm a reserved extrovert,
and I think
putting on the makeup
and the wig and the costume
unleashes her.
This is crazy.
It is so insane.
Wow, wow, wow.
- Hi, girls.
My name is Kenya Michaels.
I have 21.
I am from the island
of enchantment, Puerto Rico.
We are two Puerto Ricans.
- [laughs]
- Mama.
I'm a little person,
but I'm a fierce...bitch.
- What's her name?
- Huh?
Kenya.
- Kenya?
She's cute. Fuck.
Kenya looks fishy.
I was like,
"Crap, now I'm gonna have to be
the funny one
and not the pretty one."
- Morning, bitches.
Hey, everybody.
How y'all doing?
- Good.
- My name is Chad Michaels.
I am 40 years old.
- Shut the Cher show down.
Don't nobody do anything Cher
or Cher-adjacent.
- Yeah, 'cause
we're gonna have to row.
- Hi.
- Hi, baby.
Chad Michaels
is first and foremost
a celebrity impersonator.
That's my passion.
Cher has been what I'm most
well-known for.
This is my work outfit, baby.
- Cher comes to her for tips.
- [laughs]
I really do my best
to impersonate her with reality.
Like, you'll never see "ho!"
I will never do that
because she doesn't do that.
- How you doing?
- How you doing?
- I'm doing all right.
- I immediately saw Cher,
so I want to see what else Chad
has to offer.
[cheers and laughter]
- My name is Sharon Needles,
I'm 29 years old,
and I'm from Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania.
I look spooky,
but I'm really nice.
At least for now.
- My first impression
of Sharon Needles
was "Wow, what a whack job."
- Yes, the princess.
I'm the queen.
- The three words that would
describe Sharon Needles
are "beautiful," "spooky,"
and "stupid."
- Ow!
Eat it.
My name is Latrice Royale.
39 years of age.
- Hi, I'm Willam.
- Latrice.
- I'll hold your bag for you.
- Oh, I know you will.
[whoops]
Home team, home team.
- Miss thing came painted.
She had stones on her face,
and she was giving me all that.
- [delighted exclamation]
Latrice Royale is large
and in charge.
Chunky yet funky.
Wow.
Bold and beautiful, baby.
Mm-hmm.
Girl, the shade,
the shade of it all.
- The season four family.
- Look at this here, honey.
[cheers and applause]
- I want to know if I'm
the oldest bitch in the cut.
- You have to be.
[laughter]
[sirens]
[exclaiming variously]
- Girl, you've got she-mail.
[electronic sizzle]
We are living
in desperate times.
Birds falling from the sky,
dead fish fouling the sea,
once-fertile areas becoming
dusty, dried-up wastelands...
and that was just my last visit
to the lady doctor.
[laughter]
This is a test...
this is only a test...
to find out which one
of my girls
has the charisma, uniqueness,
nerve, and talent
to snatch the title of America's
next drag superstar.
You are the hope
for future generations
of glamazons everywhere.
Ladies, tighten your tucks.
This is the beginning
of the rest of your life.
[progressively quieter]
Life... life...life...life...
life... life...life...life...
life...
[laughter]
[cheers and applause]
- Hello, hello, hello!
Welcome to<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
[cheers and applause]
Now, enjoy this moment.
Because it won't last for long.
Now, you've signed on
for a competition
that requires severe stamina
and devastating acts of beauty.
But if you dream big
and play to win,
it will all be worth it.
In addition to winning the title
of America's
next drag superstar,
the champion
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i>
will receive a lifetime supply
of NYX cosmetics,
a one-of-a-kind trip
courtesy of ALandCHUCK.travel,
and headline
Logo's Drag Race Tour,
featuring Absolut Vodka:
cocktails perfected.
But wait, there's more.
- More?
- America's next drag superstar
will walk away
with a cash prize of...
$100,000.
[cheers and applause]
- Oh, my god.
- When I heard $100,000,
I just wanted
to just pee on the floor
and start doing flip-flops.
- That's the good news.
But here's the bad news.
- Oh, here we go.
- Okay.
- You may need to spend
that prize money quickly
because, according
to the Mayan calendar,
2012 is the year the world ends.
This week,
you'll need to survive
the biggest drag disaster
of all time.
[distorted voice]
The Rupocalypse.
[cheers and applause]
- Bring it on, bring it on!
- Oh, wait a minute.
Somebody's missing.
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Somebody is missing.
- 13, 13.
- 13, it's complete.
- I know.
Oh, pit crew.
[cheers and applause]
- Oh, my god.
- I'm sitting on that box,
it ain't opening.
- I'm going to kick that box.
- All right, boys,
let me see what you got.
- Hallelu, I'm back, bitches!
[scattered groans and applause]
Yes!
I'm back, bitches.
- Oh, hell to the no.
It's time to make room
for new queens.
- New queens?
- Yes, ma'am.
- Well, what about you, Ru?
- Oh, bitch.
Oh, you know what...
[laughter and chatter]
Pit crew,
take this box out back,
throw in a rabid honey badger...
- Yes!
- Work!
- And set it on fire!
[cheers and applause]
- What about my money!
Hallelu!
- Bye.
- Hallelu. Hallelu.
Hallelu, love you, Hallelu.
Let that be a lesson
to all of you.
My show, my rules.
Now, are you ready
for your close-up?
[cheers and applause]
- Today we have
our photo challenge,
and RuPaul said that we should
be ready for the Rupocalypse.
I'm really, really excited
to see what's gonna happen.
- Hello, Chad Michaels.
- Hi, Ru.
- I want you to meet
our favorite photographer,
Mike Ruiz.
Now, he's here to shoot
your totally toxic photo spread.
- Okay.
- Now, the pit crew
will be using their hoses
to spray you
with hazardous waste.
All of this while you spin
around in this toxic dump.
- I'm a soldier and I'm ready.
- All right.
- I want the queens
to embody the apocalypse,
but maintaining,
like, a lot of beauty
and fashion sensibility.
- Think Karen Silkwood, darling.
[camera flashes]
- Uh-oh.
- Electric storm.
- Find your li--
- Careful.
- Today just threw me
off balance.
And I was a little bit wobbly,
but I got through it,
got my bearings.
- Play to the camera.
- That queen is poison.
Dida Ritz.
- Beautiful, yes.
Give me, like,
crazy body shapes.
- You are a survivor, darling.
Grace Jones, darling.
- Beautiful.
- Give us toxic shock. Yes.
- Oh, beautiful.
To the camera, to the camera.
- Whoa!
- Oh.
You're traveling back in time.
- Back in time, darling.
- Kenya has such
a beautiful face,
but she does this really weird
thing with her mouth.
Her mouth is, like, wide open,
like she's trapping flies.
- Give it to Puerto Rico!
Beautiful.
Milan, find the camera.
- Don't cover your face.
Don't cover your face too much,
thank you--hold on!
- Ooh!
- You're spinning
out of control, girl!
- Yes.
Mahogany 2012, darling.
Sharon Needles.
- Hi, Ru.
- Did I meet you
at the free clinic?
- I think so.
I quit going.
It's so expensive.
- [laughs]
- Give me Chernobyl chic.
- Shocking beauty.
Give us some body.
- [yelps]
- Okay, now find the camera.
[yelping in slo-mo]
- Uh-oh.
- Topsy-turvy, topple over,
fatty.
And I'm like, "damn."
- Queen down!
- I couldn't let my fall
be the death of me.
- End of the world glamour.
That's right.
- Pucker your apoca-lips.
- We got it.
Alisa Summers,
give us the drama now.
- Yeah, just slide your hair
out of your face a little bit.
I want to see
that gorgeous face.
Yes, but beautiful.
You're not afraid,
you're giving me beauty.
- Aftershock.
Glow, baby, glow.
- How'd it go, mama?
- [sighs]
Spinning me all crazy.
- I've got get
out of my undergarments.
You're going to see
that I'm really
a 300-pound Latino here
in a second.
- Oh, man,
she said "300-pound Latino."
Sharon Needles.
She creeps me the fuck out.
- Oh, Lord.
- Oh, my God.
I feel like I need
to pray the rosary
when I'm talking to you.
It was hard to have
a conversation and not cringe.
- Girl, look what this duct tape
did to me.
- Ooh, you did get
a little rug burn there,
didn't you, mama?
- The duct tape for what?
- I taped my titties up today...
- Oh.
- And because I
was in it for so long,
and it was pain--
I just ripped it off.
- Oh, my god, wait, come here.
- Look.
- You know, the stakes are high,
but damn.
- Give me all
of your Princess fierceness.
- I think the pit crew
just shot on your chest.
Princess of the apocalypse.
- Yes, tortured!
Make it severe.
- Yes.
- Like angry?
- No, not angry, beautiful,
gorgeous.
Uh-huh.
- Hello, vanity.
- Ooh.
- Only your beauty will survive
the apocalypse.
- That's right.
Make love to the camera
for the very last time.
- Beautiful.
- Tina Turner,
Lashauwn<i> Beyond Thunderdome.</i>
Madame LaQueer.
There's a hole in your ozone.
Now fill it.
- [panicked sounds]
- Give me beauty face.
Madame LaQueer
was giving me comedy face
when I really wanted
high-fashion face.
Give me beauty.
- The last cover of<i> O Magazine.</i>
It burns so good.
Let them have it, Latrice.
- [squawks]
- Oh, ooh, work it.
Yes, back to the camera.
A little sexier.
- I don't do photo shoots.
I don't like 'em.
I don't never know what to do.
I feel awkward and just, like,
"What do you want me to do?"
- Face-fuck the camera, Latrice.
- What?
- Cue the aftershock.
- Electroshock.
- [yelping and laughing]
- Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Queen down, queen down.
- Ooh.
[laughs]
- Were those your underwear?
- Wait a minute,
are those your panties?
- Ooh, yes.
- Keep spraying her.
- They're artificially
inseminating her
with that toxic waste.
Dr. Schwartz at your cervix.
Willam.
- Hi.
As soon as I walked in
and saw some body splatters
like a crime scene,
I'm like,
"Yes!
Some of these bitches fell."
Shoot me.
- Release the kraken.
- Remember to always--
- Ooh, careful.
all: Ohh!
- It ain't happenin'!
- Good save. Yes.
- There you go.
- You've saved the world.
- Go home.
Go home.
- [laughs]
- It was a total shocker
to see how these girls looked
as boys.
- Oh, my god, the princess.
I was like,
"Dude, you look
like a construction worker."
Latrice...she went from looking
like Aretha Franklin
to Biggie Smalls.
- Everybody's so tiny
without shoes and hair.
Y'all don't look
like such a threat no more.
- [laughs]
- Kiss my ass.
- Ooh!
Now, wait a minute,
let's all get along.
There's no fighting.
- Willam is getting
on my nerves.
Shut up, bitch,
and just go back in that box
where Shangela
popped out of and...leave.
- I just want to say
that I love everyone,
and can we all just get along?
- Shut up.
- Oh, what?
- She wants to get along
with everybody.
I don't know.
- Oh.
- Every one of you.
I love you all.
The first day,
at least just try to get along.
And wait till a bitch
steals something of yours
or sabotages you,
and then you can wreak.
But let's not walk in here
like you own the shit.
[cheers and applause]
Ooh, I'm not a virgin.
I don't want a virgin cocktail.
- Hello, hello, hello.
[cheers and greetings]
I don't know
who these people are.
- We're robbing you.
- Now, ladies, Mike and I
went over your totally
toxic photos.
One of you
was truly drop-dead gorgeous.
The winner of your very first
challenge is...
Jiggly Caliente.
- Yeah!
Yes!
Fat girl win the first
challenge!
- Con-drag-ulations, Jiggly.
- Thank you, mama.
- I love your totally
toxic photo so much,
I'm gonna tweet it tonight.
Hashtag Rupocalypse.
- [taunting singsong sound]
- Now, my queens,
I wish you sweet dreams
because tomorrow
is gonna be a living nightmare.
- Oh, shit.
She's going to put us
through something,
and it's not gonna be pretty.
- All right.
- Bye.
all: Bye!
- You won the first challenge.
- Whoo!
- Good job, boo, good job.
- Thank you.
- They brought us
to this old hotel
in the middle of a sketchy area.
And I'm like,
"What are they gonna do?"
- Ladies, I've invited you
to this godforsaken place
for this week's main challenge.
It's here that you will scavenge
among the ruins
to put together
a fabulous outfit
that screams
post-apocalyptic couture.
Now, you can use your own wigs,
undergarments, and shoes,
but the rest has to be looted.
Now, you're probably wondering,
"Ru, where am I going to get
all these materials?"
[laughs]
Well, you know what they say...
only three things will survive
the Rupocalypse:
Cockroaches,
Cher...
- Amen.
[laughter]
- And drag queen zombies!
- What?
[doors creaking ominously]
[snarling and groaning]
- The zombies
were scary as hell.
They got, like, guts coming out
and eyes popping out.
I'm like, mm-mmm, no, ma'am.
- When I saw the zombies comin'
after me,
I was about to hit it.
- [snarls]
- All right, you've got three
minutes to grab what you can.
And avoid being eaten alive.
Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best woman live.
[whimpers]
[zombies groaning]
- Give it, bitch!
- So I'm running around
in between these zombies
and I realize that they're
former competitors
from competitions past.
Shannel, Venus,
Morgan McMichael's, Delta Work.
- I got to see Akashia, Raven,
Pandora Boxx, Ongina.
- Drop it, bitch.
- Oh, maybe some--oh, oh, yeah,
you're not a zombie.
For a quick second, I thought
Chad Michaels was a zombie.
It's just that Halloween mask
of a face that she has.
- Mine.
- Give me that, give me that,
give me that.
No, no, no, no, no.
Bitch, bitch, you crazy.
I'm from new York, motherfucker.
- Oh, well, of course, a corset.
- Girl!
- I'm looking
for anything sparkly,
anything structured,
anything that I can glue
onto a costume that I create,
and then, after that,
I just start
grabbing everything.
- Sorry, girls.
- [screeches]
- Oh! Hi.
Oh, you're drop dead gorgeous.
Ooh, I dig the look.
Oh, no, honey, I'm on your side.
- When I saw the zombies
and then Sharon Needles,
I thought she probably felt
like she was at home.
- God, it's like
a family reunion.
Hey, sorry, sis.
- [screams]
Black people don't stand there
while zombies
are coming at them.
They run, bitch.
[screaming]
[snarling and growling]
[indistinct yelling]
[objects clattering]
- [screaming]
No, no!
[screams]
Oh, Hallelu!
Oh, Hallelu!
[munching sounds]
[emergency alarms sounding]
- Welcome back, girls.
[cheering]
- We get back to the workroom,
and there's more supplies
to help us with our outfits.
And everybody just went off.
- Can we flip this over?
- Uh-uh-uh.
- I grabbed it.
- We're like drag queen savages
who've been locked up.
We were just tearing each other
apart to get in these boxes.
- That shit's mine!
Everything in here is mine.
- Oh.
- Oh, fuck.
- Thank god I'm good at math.
One small corset
plus another small corset
equals one fat-ass
corset, bitch.
[laughter]
[hammering]
- Get it, Lashauwn, get it.
- Going to break
that motherfucker.
- So Ru tells us
that we have to make
a "post-apopaloctic" outfit,
and I don't know
what that means.
It's the end of the world.
I sew for a living.
And I can't go down the runway
lookin' a fool.
- Yay, I got it.
- Lashauwn thinks he's Magellan,
splitting the earth in half
or something.
- I don't think art historians
would appreciate that.
- I don't know what she's doing.
Lashauwn might be going home.
- Hello, hello, hello.
all: Hi.
- Let's get this
end-of-the-world party started.
Hi, Princess.
Wow, what do we have here?
- I'm kind of going
for Rupocalypse
meets<i> Black Swan</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
meets the princess.
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah, yeah.
- How does this say
"end of the world"?
- Well, it's
kind of armor.
Like, if a ballerina
were preparing
for, you know, a comet.
- Mmm.
But I'm looking
for post-apocalyptic couture,
<i>Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome.</i>
- So after the comet
has landed, then?
- Yes.
- Okay, I got you.
I'm definitely nervous
about how much time
we have left.
I just need to rethink and redo.
- I'm gonna let you get to it.
- Okay, cool.
- I can't wait.
- Thank you.
- All right.
Well, Sharon Needles.
- Hi, Ru.
- Wow. Tell me about this.
- I'm kind of going
for a Linda Hamilton,
<i>Beauty and the Beast,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
trapped under the city
because of an impending
nuclear dust cloud, and--
- Now, I love all that,
but how are you
going to make that read
on the main stage?
- I am a little nervous.
I'm worried that the judges
aren't going to quite
get the look, but...
to get anywhere
in this competition,
you got to take a risk.
- I noticed you have a Tammy
Faye Bakker tattoo on your arm.
- I do.
She was a huge idol to me
as a kid.
I didn't even know
she was selling Christianity.
I thought
she was selling me makeup.
- [laughs]
All right, I'm going to let you
get back to work, okay?
- Okay, thank you.
- Lashauwn Beyond.
- Hi, Ru.
- What do we have here?
- Well, this is just a top.
And that's my hair.
I'm gonna make it
look explosive.
- That's your hair?
- Yes.
- Wow.
- I want to dye it,
but I'm still trying
to be couture and pretty.
- So the silhouette is gonna
be a traditional silhouette,
where it's a bustier
and a full bottom.
- I'm not too sure yet.
- You're not sure yet?
You know, there's $100,000
at stake here.
- I know.
- And you don't seem too worried
about the time here.
- I am, I am, I am.
- Huh.
Well, time is running out...
- You're right.
- For all of us.
- I know.
- You've got
a lot of work to do,
and there's $100,000
on the line.
- Stop reminding me. Oh, my god.
- Yeah, so...
- It's making me sweat.
- I'm not finished,
so I'm really feeling a certain
type of way.
I don't know.
I don't know what to do.
Oh, Lord.
- You have got
to make it happen.
- I will.
- All right, thanks, Lashauwn.
- Take care.
- Jiggly Caliente.
- Hey, mama.
- May I call you Jiggly?
- Of course, mama,
everything jiggles.
- [laughs]
Now, tell me about this
post-apocalyptic couture.
- This is my<i> Escape from New</i>
<i>York</i><span style="bodyStyle"> post-apocalyptic outfit.</i>
- Ah.
- So I need my solar panel
pieces
to make my lights light up.
- I don't see a real dress.
- I'm gonna wear a corset.
And I'm finishing that up
with some more...
garbage.
- All right, listen.
I'm gonna let you
get back to work.
- Yes, mama.
- So you just bring it.
- I will, definitely.
- Alisa.
- Hi, Ru, how are you?
- Hey,<i> mami.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
Now, what do we have here?
- This is what I will be wearing
after the Rupocalypse.
- [laughs]
You are a breastplate girl,
aren't you?
- It's basically a swimsuit
with some titties on it.
- Hey.
- Hello.
- Now, you know
that the judges are...
let's just say they're
a bunch of bitches.
- Yeah.
- Are you ready for that?
- Oh, I'm so ready.
I'm sure that they're gonna
love it.
- Listen, you've got to bring
your game.
- Oh, I'm doing it, Ru.
- All right, get back to work.
- All right, Ru.
See you later.
- Latrice Royale.
- Well, hello, Ru.
- Sounds like a gorgeous
after-dinner cocktail, yes.
- Sweet and delicious.
- All right, honey.
Ooh, you're making me thirsty.
Now, listen, I've lived
a long time,
and I've had those years
where it felt like
it was the end of the world
as we know it today.
- Yes.
- What was your end-of-the-world
moment?
- Really, you really
want to know?
- Mm-hmm.
- Um...when I went to prison.
I went to prison.
Um, I made some stupid mistakes,
and I got 18 months in, uh--
in the hole.
And during that period,
I lost my mom.
- Mmm.
- And those were my worst two
fears come true.
That was a dreadful,
tragic year for me.
I couldn't even go to my
mother's funeral.
It was the most
degrading experience
I've ever had in my life.
But I'm a survivor,
I'm a fighter,
and I persevered
through triumph,
you know what I mean?
- Yeah.
- I had a plan when I got out.
And my community
came to my rescue.
They had a "Get Latrice Royale
back on her feet
and on the stage" benefit.
- Wow.
- And it worked.
Now I'm on<i> RuPaul's Drag Race,</i>
living my dream.
- I love it.
All right, kiddo.
Get back to work.
- Thank you, sweetie.
- All right.
All right, ladies, gather
'round.
Now, tomorrow, you'll make your
doomsday debut
on the main stage,
where we'll be joined
by our extra-special guest
judge,
one of my best girlfriends...
the mistress of the dark,
Elvira, will be here.
[cheers and applause]
- I'm so excited, I can't even
put it into words.
She's my idol since I was five
years old.
- Ladies, the human race
depends on you for the survival
of drag.
But if you fail, it's not the
end of the world.
Oh, wait a minute, it is.
So don't fuck it up. Bye.
all: Bye.
- Good morning.
Yay.
- Mama, what a mess.
- This is a freakin'
disaster area.
- Today is runway day.
It is elimination day.
It is all getting very real,
bitches.
- Someone's going home
today, girls.
- So, Lashauwn, how you feeling
about your look?
Is it coming along?
- To be honest with you,
I really don't know.
- What was Ru's feedback?
- I think she was really...
hinting that it wasn't enough.
- Uh-huh.
- You want to impress her.
- Absolutely.
- And I don't feel like I did.
- It's coming together.
It's gonna be fine.
Lashauwn is a little bit
on edge.
But you got to put the rooter
to the tooter at this point.
You've got to just sell it.
You crazy and creative
and outside the box.
You're always "beyond."
- I know you trying to let me
have it, too.
- No, well, as far as the looks
and the way you look,
it doesn't get any better
than this.
- Thank you.
- Okay, you better do it, honey.
- Talk to me, boo.
How you feeling?
- About the challenge?
- Yeah.
- Feel like everything
will be fine.
I just got to work it out.
- Well, you know, I'm a little
nervous,
but I think it's going
to be fine,
and I think that my mom
is going to be really happy
to see this, so...
- In 2007, I lost my mom,
and it was a rough year.
- If you don't mind me asking,
um, how did she pass away?
- My mom had an aortic aneurysm.
She had complications after
surgery.
And...she just...went down.
- What was your relationship
like with your mom?
- My mom was always there.
But me being a drag queen was,
like, one of the biggest
arguments we've had, 'cause she
never understood why I wanted
to do it so much.
The last few months that she
was alive, she did understand.
I was able to tell my mom
everything.
I'm angry.
When everything was
on the table,
I had three months with my mom
and...three months?
Like, damn.
- Your mother is here.
She's here...you know, and
just--just do what you need
to do and bring it.
- Are you nervous at all?
- Wait, are you trying
to read me
and tell me I should be nervous?
- Nah, it's cute for, like,
pirate couture.
- I changed my outfit last
night,
but today I'm feeling really
nervous about it.
- Are you upset that you had to
change your outfit?
- Ru just didn't like it.
She wasn't feeling it,
so I had to go more
post-apocalypse with it.
I was just so in my head about
it, about her being like...
"Nope," so I was like, "I'm just
"gonna--fuck it, I'm just
gonna change it all."
I took a risk in my look and I'm
freaking out, because if you
mess up, you go home.
- Okay, I'm going in on this
bitch.
- All right.
- You got an instant facelift
with this, dahling.
- What the fuck is that
on her head?
- I don't know what that is,
girl.
- The weakest out of everybody,
I would say, is Sharon Needles.
Sharon's outfit looks more like
a brown tube sock that she just
stretched out.
Looks like she got it at a
discount costume store.
She's not at that point, right
now, to compete, so, if
anything, I feel like she's
gonna be the first one
to go home.
- Can I just tell you, like,
I'm so glad that you're here?
- I'm so glad you're here, too.
- No, because I don't know
anybody else who does your drag.
- Right.
- You know, and I know that
some of the other queens are
just like, "Why is she here,
she's a freak."
- Really?
Well, they can think all they
want.
There's a million kinds of drag.
And it's not just being a fishy,
annoying girl.
- Yep.
- I think some of the girls
here, particularly the beauty
queens, might be looking at me
as just a freak.
And I want to show them that I
have everything that it takes
to win this competition.
And more.
- You are exactly the type
of guy that I go for too.
- Oh, stop it.
- Like, that whole, like, meth
look, like, that's...
- "Meth look."
- [laughs]
- Only I could take that
as a compliment.
- Have either of you ever been,
like, arrested or...?
- No, ma'am.
- Oh, yeah.
Um, I have a DUI.
The day I got my call to come
here is the--my last day that I
was--I was on probation.
- Really?
- Uh-huh, so it was like--that
was such a blessed day.
Over the last year I've been
dealing with a DUI.
It's just been such a struggle
for 15 months.
I've been without being able to
drive.
It's hard for me to keep a
regular job.
They arrested me in drag.
- No!
- Biggest fear ever.
- Oh, okay, I thought--
- In handcuffs, in full paint,
full body, everything.
- I kind of would like that,
though.
- No.
They made me undress in front of
a room full of people
they had arrested.
Like, nobody would touch me.
They ruined my life
for 15 months,
but it's over now, and my life
is about to change.
I'm ready for the whole country
to know who Alisa Summers is,
and I hope they're ready for me.
- I just feel like my stuff
needs more.
- I'm worried that they're not
gonna get it.
Honestly, I think you better
create a really good story
for it.
- Okay, what I'm gonna say is,
<i>"Escape from New York--"</i>
ooh, shit, it's falling apart.
- Yeah, that's not good, either.
- Yeah.
- Jiggly's costume is a hot
mess.
It's all hot glue and scissor
work.
It's just like an explosion
of aluminum foil.
- Baked potato couture.
- You look like you're ready to
bake at 350.
[laughter]
[applause]
- Welcome to the main stage
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
Well, look what the zombies
dragged in.
Michelle Visage, you're back and
better than ever.
- Don't you know it, my lovely
lady in red.
- Mike Ruiz, I'd stop the world
and melt with you, darlin'.
- Oh, here we go again, Ru.
- [laughs]
Sometimes it's champagne,
sometimes it's pretzels
and beer,
but Santino's still here.
[laughter]
- And the eternal beauty,
mistress of the dark, Elvira.
- [gasps] Me?
- Hey, girl, you're gonna put
somebody's eyes out
with those things.
- [gasps] I hope it's not yours.
- [laughs]
Now, this week I asked our
queens to rise from the glittery
ashes and blow us away with
their post-apocalyptic couture.
Are you ready to see what's on
the other side?
- Bring it.
- Yeah.
- Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.
- First up, Willam.
- Not Willem Dafoe.
- No, not Willem Dafoe.
- And not Will.I.Am.
- Not Will.I.Am.
- Very Westwood, too.
Only one boob, though.
- Yeah, the other one got lost
in the apocalypse.
- As I'm walking down
the runway,
I'm trying to give them some 90s
supermodel.
Ass, ass, titties, hair, hair,
gas mask.
- Cloudy with a chance of acid
rain.
- I like the gas mask on the
back of her head, it's very
two-faced.
- Willam's a real gas.
[laughter]
- Up next, Phi Phi O'Hara.
- Two queens enter,
one queen leave.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Is that a dream catcher
covering her private parts?
- Yes.
- [laughs]
- I knew I looked fierce,
I knew that my outfit could not
be touched.
I felt like all the attention
was on me.
I was just ready to serve it to
all the judges.
- I think that's a honey badger
on her shoulders.
- Maybe we do need another hero.
- We might just need another
hero, Santino.
- Lashauwn Beyond.
- Oh!
- Fabulous.
- Lashauwn be hot.
- Yes, ma'am.
She's got the whole world on
her...head?
- I thought a giant chicken laid
an egg up there.
- I live for what I put down the
runway.
I had the world on my head, and
my "post-apoc-oloptic" couture
costume.
It was sickening.
- Now, I wonder if she can get
cable TV with that on her head.
- [laughs]
- Chad Michaels.
- Okay.
- Oh.
- Ooh, how chic.
She could walk a mile for
a camel toe.
- Real fish caught in the net.
- I'm a perfectionist.
It's something I pride
myself on.
I'm feeling very confident.
I love what I'm wearing, very
post-apocalyptic diva, and I'm
feeling really, really good.
- Very "Lawrence of my labia."
[laughter]
- Up next, The Princess.
- [gasps]
- Wow.
- Wow, clown slippers.
Looks like a life jacket.
- Yes, queen overboard.
- I'm giving the judges
<i>Waterworld</i><span style="bodyStyle"> couture.</i>
I feel like I'm really living
for what I'm serving.
I love it.
- In case of emergency, your
scarf can be used as a flotation
device.
[laughter]
Kenya Michaels.
- Ooh.
- Oh.
- She's a phoenix rising from
the ashes.
- That's right.
- That's it.
- Firebird.
- Walk that walk!
- [squawks]
- I feel amazing.
I'm feeling fire, I'm<i> fuego!</i>
That moment I remember for all
my life.
- Cock-a-doodle-doo.
Lil' Kim in the house.
- Something's sprouting back
there.
- Her garden is in full bloom.
- Latrice Royale.
- Yes, she is.
- Whoo!
- Ooh, it's Latrice
from Whoville.
- Yes, mama.
- I'm Latrice, so of course I
stomped it on out, and I'm
givin' big girl sexy, showin'
all my curves and swerves, and
givin' a little face, givin' a
little attitude,
and a lot of ass.
- Yes, beyond thunder thighs.
[laughter]
Serve, honey.
- Mm-hmm.
- A queen for all seasons,
Alisa summers.
She's got goggles up there.
- Apparently,
she's going skiing.
- Ooh, I hate when drag queens
have bigger boobs than me.
- I'll say.
The hills are alive.
- I'm givin' them sexy, I'm
givin' them dominatrix, and I'm
on top of the world.
There's no feeling like that,
ever.
- And she's an all-terrain
vehicle.
- Yes.
- She a ATV summers, all-terrain
vajay-jay.
- That's right.
- Oh!
[laughter]
- Paris, London, Tokyo, Milan.
- Uh-huh.
- Oh.
- Wow.
- This is an infected Betsey
Johnson, right?
- Yes, it is.
-<i> Love is a Battlefield.</i>
- I'm serving the judges
savage beauty.
I'm feeling ferocious.
- I'm ready to attack.
- Milan is burning.
Now, let this be a lesson to all
of us--don't smoke in bed.
[laughter]
- Next up, Jiggly Caliente.
- Oh.
- Look, she's got a leg up on
the other girls.
- Yes, she does.
Apparently, hoarding is the new
black.
[laughter]
- I'm here on the runway, and
my adrenaline is on fire.
Everything is pulsating through
me, and I'm like, "Oh, here we
"go, bitch, I'm gonna show you
plus-size supermodel."
- She's one hot potato.
- And she seals in her natural
juices.
[laughter]
- Dida Ritz.
- Work.
- Come on, girl.
- Yes.
- Ooh.
- Chocolate Barbie doll.
- Legs for days.
- I'm doin' my runway,
it's sickening.
I am definitely channeling
Naomi, I am channeling Giselle.
I'm feeling it.
- You know, everything tastes
better when it sits on
a Dida Ritz.
- With thighs like that--
- You better ass somebody.
- Crack is whack.
- Oh, Madame LaQueer.
- Looks like my leftovers
last night.
- Give her an inch, she'll take
a foot.
- Take that, Betty Rubble.
- I'm serving attitude and I
feel so great, like I have never
felt before in my life.
- The entree of the evening,
filet of sole.
- Mmm, goes great
with some toe jam.
- Mmm.
- Ew!
- All right for Sharon Needles.
- Ooh, look at those eyes.
- Nosferatutu.
- Oh, she's bleeding.
- A dead woman walking.
- Oh, my goodness.
- Zombies.
- Somebody call a dentist.
- I hope she's wearing
a dental dam.
[laughter]
- Coming down the runway, the
best part was slowly letting out
a giant mouthful of fake blood
all over my body, and that's
when I really saw Ru's
eyebrow raise.
It's a disco bloodbath.
- Oh.
- Ooh.
- It is.
- Anyone told her
about fluoride toothpaste?
- Gingivitis never looked
so good.
Welcome, ladies.
Judgment day has arrived.
Now, based on your totally toxic
photo shoot and your
post-apocalyptic presentation,
I've made some decisions.
Will the following queens please
step forward.
Willam.
Milan.
Dida Ritz.
Latrice Royale.
Madame LaQueer.
Phi Phi O'Hara.
Chad Michaels.
Seven of you look like you've
been to hell and back.
Con-drag-ulations, you're safe.
- [exhales]
- Just safe?
My outfit was amazing, and not
"just safe."
- You may leave the stage.
Oh, ladies?
While you're back there, you may
want to think of ways to make a
more memorable impression
next week.
- Yes, ma'am.
- That's all.
Ladies, you six represent the
best and the worst of the week.
It is time for the judges'
critiques.
First up, Lashauwn Beyond.
In the workroom you seemed
kind of nervous.
Do you feel
more comfortable now?
- No.
It's a competition.
I'm always worried, I'm worried
now, I'm nervous.
- America's next drag superstar
needs nerve.
She doesn't need to be nervous.
- I am impressed that she can
carry that giant thing
on her head.
I mean, I have this giant thing
on my head, and it's bad enough.
- [laughs]
- As a symbol I think it's
really great, of, like, a
strong, black woman with the
world on her head.
I love all the disparate parts
that you put together to create
this overall silhouette.
- Is there anything you'd like
to say to the judges, Lashauwn?
- I'm just in disbelief.
- What can't you believe?
- That I'm here.
- Bitch, you're here.
- Yeah, honey, you better snap
out of it, you're here.
Play to win.
- Okay.
- Thank you.
Up next we've got
Sharon Needles.
- Hello, RuPaul.
- How'd it feel up there
on the runway?
- Oh, I felt drop-dead gorgeous.
[laughter]
- This is my kind of ghoul.
I mean, I love the blood,
and this is a whole different
kind of take on drag queens.
- You know, everyone sort of
like survived the apocalypse,
and made do with what was left.
You took it one step further,
and you didn't survive
the apocalypse.
And then you came back to life
to terrorize these bitches.
[laughter]
- Thank you, Sharon Needles.
Next up, Jiggly Caliente.
- Hey, mama.
- Okay, no one's gonna
accuse you
of not havin' a great pair
of legs.
- [laughs]
- First of all.
But there's a little too much,
it's sort of like,
"Oh, my god, ah."
I'm getting my eyeballs
assaulted.
Just a little bit less could
have been more.
- Jiggly is a ball of energy,
and funny, and I love that.
- Thank you.
- But, girl, right now
you're a mess.
Things are fallin' off.
Fix your tutu.
I be seein' your privates
and stuff.
- No, girl, that privates
are put away.
- Jiggly, is there anything
you'd like to say to the judges?
- There's more, so much more.
- More than what you've got on?
- Well, but I'm talkin' about
all my clothes, all my drag,
when I wear it out here--
- We've heard that story before.
You have got to bring your
A game every single time.
There's $100,000 at stake.
- The time to bring it is every
single time you come out
to this runway.
Every single time.
- I will, mama.
- Next up, Kenya Michaels.
-<i> Hola.</i>
- So why a firebird?
- I really--she's a firebird
because if you're thinkin', uh,
end of the world, you're think
on fire, and I love that.
- You pounded this runway.
You came out, you were on fire.
I wish you had your wings with
you right now, because I'd like
to see the work you put
into them.
- You know that old phrase,
"Don't get your panties
in a bunch"?
- Yes.
- Your panties look a little bit
like they're in a bunch,
like a little diaper.
- My problem is, it doesn't
look really post-apocalyptic,
but I still think you're
beautiful, and you kill
a runway.
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Kenya.
Next up, Alisa Summers.
Tell me about your outfit.
- I wanted to give kind of
a post-apocalyptic S&amp;M goddess.
- And tell me the significance
of the tool jutting out
of the areola.
- I like to shoot fire
out of my titties.
- Oh, okay.
- The boobices, where'd those
come from?
- What it is, it's like--it's
built like a swimsuit, and it's
just got the titties built right
onto it.
- I was getting scared.
I thought you were gonna say you
pulled everything up
from down there.
- From down here, all the way
up, yes.
- You've got some big ones,
girl.
And I'm feeling right now like
my makeup is looking natural.
- When you came out, I didn't
really see anything
post-apocalyptic
about your wardrobe.
It's not couture, either.
Even had you come out looking
like a big garbage heap, or
something, then there would have
still been more effort made,
to me, than what you have on.
- Who the frig says what
couture is, anyway?
I don't get it.
For him to say that's not
couture.
Well, it's couture to me, girl.
- [laughs]
- And I love how much makeup you
have on.
- Thank you.
- We kind of match.
- All right.
Next up, the princess.
- Nice outfit.
Who shot the lifeboat?
- It feels like it has a
nautical theme, a little bit,
to me.
- I'm kind of like Dennis Hopper
in<i> Waterworld.</i>
- I love that you approached it
from a nautical standpoint, the
world being consumed by water,
as opposed to fire and
brimstone,
which is what everyone else did.
- Thank you.
- You put together
a well-constructed look,
but there's no dirt, and you're
going through an apocalypse.
Like, it's completely--like,
your whites are whiter
than I've ever...
[laughter]
Done my laundry in my life.
- All right.
Well, girls, I think
we've heard enough.
- While you enjoy an Absolut
cocktail in the interior
illusions lounge, the judges
and I will deliberate.
You may leave the stage.
All right, just between us
girls, let's start with
Lashauwn Beyond.
- I thought the outfit
was fierce.
I love the headdress, but she's
kind of uncomfortable,
she kind of
looks like she's at her first
prom, and--
- Yeah, what was that about?
- Eh, maybe she needs a couple
more years to cook, you know?
- I thought Lashauwn, more than
any of the other queens, really
met this challenge head on.
- There's definitely some skills
that are worth exploring,
but she definitely needs to
overcome her shyness.
- Yeah, it's cute for a taste,
but not for a swallow.
- Sharon Needles.
Now, I really dug her outfit.
It really told the story.
- It's obvious she's polished,
and she knows what she's doing,
but I want to see her in girl
drag, too.
- I love Sharon Needles.
It's hard for me to find
something bad about that.
- Jiggly Caliente.
Really funny, funny kid, but
that costume, I don't even know
where to start.
- She looked like she threw
everything but the kitchen sink
in there, but I think I saw
the kitchen sink in there.
- [laughs]
- It was the complete opposite
of the apocalypse.
- Right.
- But I'm so in love with her
as a person.
- Me, too.
- Kenya Michaels.
Cute kid.
When she walked down the runway,
she dazzled us with
those wings, but then she just
lost them.
- Yeah.
- She lost the most exciting
part of her outfit.
- I did have an issue with
the bedazzled diaper.
Not apocalyptic at all.
- No.
- But that bitch
is fierce.
- Alisa Summers.
- She's so stunningly
beautiful, I think she's used to
kind of resting on those
laurels, do you know
what I mean?
I think it threw her
a little bit.
You know, you need more
than beauty.
- I got to say, Alisa 's outfit
was very tacky.
- She built her whole costume
around that breastplate, instead
of using it as a detail within
some, like, grander, couture
sort of concept.
- Right.
- Right.
- Her outfit reminded me
of the worst movie in the world.
- What?
-<i> Showgirls.</i>
- Stop it right now!
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Mistress of the dark.
- I mean, my favorite movie.
- All right. The Princess.
- I loved the blue and
the orange together.
That was my high school colors.
- Go bears!
- I liked and appreciated her
overall look, but it wasn't
really post-apocalyptic.
I wasn't picking up
her references.
- You know, I immediately got
that<i> Waterworld</i><span style="bodyStyle"> reference.</i>
I love the Pete Burns,
androgynous sort of vibe.
I think she's great.
- All right.
Silence!
Bring back my girls.
Welcome back, ladies.
Now, which one of you bitches
will inherit the earth?
Lashauwn Beyond.
Your post-apocalyptic outfit
towered above the other queens,
but your personality fell flat.
You're safe.
- Thank you.
- You may join the other girls.
Jiggly Caliente.
Your totally toxic photo shoot
was winning, but your
post-apocalyptic couture was
an unnatural disaster.
I'm sorry, my dear, but you are
up for elimination.
- When Ru tells me I'm in the
bottom two, I want to die.
I know the outfit looks jank,
but damn.
- Sharon Needles.
You killed this bloody
challenge, and you really stuck
it to the other girls.
Con-drag-ulations, you are
the winner of this challenge.
[applause]
You'll receive immunity from
elimination next week.
- Thank you.
- Plus, a custom gown from
sequinqueen.com.
That's sequinqueen.com.
- I won the challenge today,
and I'm feeling ecstatic.
- [squeals]
I'll have my dress made
in black.
- Thank you.
- With a plunging neckline.
- Hey, wait a minute.
- All right, Sharon, you may
join the other girls.
The Princess.
Your<i> Waterworld</i><span style="bodyStyle"> inspired</i>
couture got a little lost at
sea...but I'm throwing you
a lifeline.
You're safe.
- Thank you.
- Kenya Michaels.
You pummeled the runway, but
your firebird didn't fly with
the judges.
Alisa Summers, your
post-apocalyptic showgirl left
little to the imagination, but
you were not "breast in show."
Kenya...
you are safe.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
- Alisa, I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
- Ru says I'm in the bottom two.
It was just like, "really?"
I--I can't believe it.
I can't believe it.
- Two queens stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me and save yourself
from elimination.
The time has come for you to
lip sync for your life.
- I am not givin' up my spot in
this competition, no way,
no how.
They have to pry this out of
my cold, dead hands.
- Good luck,
and don't fuck it up.
- I'm giving them face, I'm
giving them movements.
I'm feeling very confident.
- All I could think about is
"Kill it, kill it, kill it, hit
every move, hit every beat."
I have to pull out every trick.
If I have to shoot ping pongs
out of my ass, I will do it.
- Alisa is not turning it as
much as Jiggly is.
She's kicking, she's doing
choreography,
she's really turning the party.
She had marked her territory.
She shit On the stage.
- Jiggly started sheddin'
feathers and ornaments like a
Christmas tree that was gettin'
thrown out the window.
I was entertained.
I would-a given it some money.
- The whole number that Alisa
was doin' was slo-mo, girl.
This is called<i> Drag Race,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> not</i>
<i>Drag Walk.</i>
[applause]
- Ladies, I've made my decision.
Alisa Summers.
You are beautiful, talented, and
a queen for all seasons.
Just not this one.
Now sashay away.
- [whispering indistinctly]
- I definitely didn't think I'd
be the first person to go.
I definitely thought there were
other people more eligible to go
home before me, but I'm not
disappointed in myself.
I'm disappointed in what could
have been.
- Jiggly Caliente.
May I call you Jiggly?
- Yes, mama.
- Shante, you stay.
- Thank you.
- You may join the other girls.
The toxic 12, con-drag-ulations.
You live to die another day.
Now, remember, if you can't love
yourself, how in the hell you
gonna love somebody else?
Can I get a "amen" in here?
all: Amen.
- [laughs]
Now let the music play.


-<i> Tonight all the queens are</i>

Give a big round of applause.
[cheers and applause]
Working with America's
fiercest drag queens
is bittersweet.
I'm thrilled when they're here,
but it kills me
when they sashay away.
Let's take a look
at some of the queens
who were gone too soon.
[cheers and applause]
[somber piano music]
- Eww!
- Welcome.
First up, Alisa Summers.
Now, were you surprised
that Jiggly sent you packing
with her sickening
lip sync and split?
- Did you see that outfit
she was wearing, honey?
When she was creating that
thing,
I was like, there is no way,
there is no way,
even if I'm bottom two.
Honey, but she turned it out.
But then again,
if I was wearing sneakers
I could have turned it out too.
[laughter and boos]
- Now, Lashauwn
and The Princess,
both of you were criticized
for being too low-key.
Do you regret not speaking out?
- I regret not speaking out
because I don't think
people got the chance
to really know who I was
and what I'm about.
So, yeah, most definitely
I regret it.
- Yeah?
And what about you, Princess?
- The only thing that I regret
is that the rest of America
didn't get to see what else
I had to show.
If I was more of a character,
say like Willam,
I probably could have
stuck around longer,
because, uh, I had more to show,
and frankly what came after me,
after I got kicked off
down the runway,
it was kind of lame.
[audience oohs]
- All right, now--
[laughter]
Madame LaQueer,
you won challenges,
and yet you were repeatedly
picked last
by your fellow queens.
How did that make you feel?
- Well, for a second
that made me feel bad
but in the moment that
made me feel in high school.
I get picked last
for the basketball team,
but, bitch,
I was a maid of honor.
Okay?
- Now, all of you
left the competition
before one of our favorite
mini challenges.
So I'm gonna give you a chance
to prove that
reading is fundamental.
[cheers and applause]
Madame LaQueer,
the library is open, darling.
[cheers]
- Jiggly Caliente.
I know I can call you Jiggly.
But, mama, where's your teeth?
I know, hanging out
with your good taste.
[audience oohs]
[applause]
- Ladies, stick around
because we've got
a lot more shade thrown
before we crown
America's next drag superstar.
[cheers and applause]
[techno music]
Welcome back to<i> RuPaul's</i>
<i>Drag Race: Reunited.</i>
Tonight all my girls are back
to help me crown
America's next drag superstar.
Now while our top three
are getting ready backstage,
I wanna talk to a queen
who became famous,
or should I say infamous,
for flipping her wig.
Let's take a look.
- That's a desperate
cry for attention.
- A little<i> I am what I am,</i>
<i>La Cage.</i>
- Milan, girl,
that's clearly a dude.
[cheers and applause]
- London, Paris, Milan.
You look great.
Now, have you done something
different with your hair?
Oh, no--oh, you're wearing it.
[laughter]
Now, I gotta ask,
I gotta ask,
now, were you surprised
by the uproar
over all the hair flipping?
- You know, to be honest,
I was a bit surprised.
I, um--I think that people
sometimes misinterpret
what I do as an artist.
At times you'll disagree,
and I respect that.
- So do you feel like
flipping your wig right now?
Let's do it together.
You first.
Ready?
Come on, come on, let's do it.
Come on, Milan.
Come on.
- For real?
- No!
- For real?
- No, thank you, Milan.
- Thank you, guys.
- Next up, when it came time
to put an outfit together,
this queen got Jiggly with it.
Let's take a look.
- The thing is,
I don't need to sew
to become
the next drag superstar.
- I don't see a real dress.
- I'm finishing that up
with some more...
garbage.
- Baked potato couture.
- Girl, right now you're a mess.
Things are falling off.
Fix your tutu.
- Where the fuck are my tits?
- It ain't the school for drag.
Let's face it,
she just took a bunch of pom-pom
and she just threw it on top.
It just looks horrible.
It looks horrible.
- Beyoncé don't be sewing
her shit.
[laughter]
- Hello, Jiggly Caliente.
May I call you Jiggly?
- Of course, darling.
Everybody does.
- [laughs]
Now--now listen.
Now, your struggles with sewing
and design brought you down.
Have you been working on this?
- My brother gave me a gift.
Like, after his tax return check
came,
he decided--he decided to get me
sewing lessons.
So in a couple weeks I'm gonna
start my sewing classes,
and then I'm gonna turn it
the fuck out.
[laughter and applause]
- All right, so all right.
Let's talk about
your temper tantrums.
- I mean,
like I said on the show,
I kept it 100 all day every day.
- You kept it 100?
- All day--
- Not 95?
- Not 95.
100 all day every day.
And some people
just didn't like it.
And sometimes they took
my temper or my anger,
and there was just
so many issues I had
also coming onto the show.
When I got home,
I went to go get--
went to go see therapy.
I have serious daddy issues
and--
- Honey, don't we all?
Right?
- Well--
[laughter]
- Um, so the therapist told me
to write a letter, and I did.
- You wrote a letter to daddy?
- Yeah, I did.
But she didn't tell me that,
you know, to really mail it.
I mailed it,
and the right address.
So whoever gets it--
- Well, actually, I have
the letter right here, Jiggly.
- Oh, shit!
- No.
[laughter]
[cheers and applause]
- All right, next up Dida Ritz.
Dida, during your time
on<i> Drag Race,</i>
you had a breakthrough
with your family.
Let's take a look.
- Surprise, Dida.
- [gasps]
- It's your mom.
- That's my mommy.
- Say hi, dad.
- Hi.
- We just wanted to let you know
how much we love you
and we miss you.
And we're really proud of you
for pursuing your dreams.
Love you!
See you soon.
Bye-bye.
- So, Dida, what's happened
since the show?
- Since the show, you know,
before my parents
never saw me in drag,
they'd never been to a show,
and now they watch the show.
My family is, like,
the biggest fans.
My mom calls me so much,
and she's always telling me
how my grandparents
watch the show
every time it comes on reruns.
And my mom's actually here.
- Is she here?
Your mother's here?
Oh, there--
may I call you Mama Ritz?
- Yes, you may.
- Now, in the clip we heard
your husband in the background.
What does he think about Dida
on television in drag?
- He's proud of him.
- Really?
- Mm-hmm, and he loves him.
- How does it feel
to get this acceptance
from your father
and your mother?
- It feels amazing.
You know,
every time I've seen you
I've said thank you
a million times
because you're bringing
happy homes together
and especially religious homes
together.
So I guess for me
it's a blessing,
and it's something
I feel very happy to have
because I know that there
are people out there
who don't have that, you know?
My mom's sitting here right now,
so...
- Yeah, yeah.
[cheers and applause]
Your parents are proud of you,
and so am I.
And like I always say,
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race:</i>
Bringing families together.
[laughter]
It's true.
Up next, little Kenya Michaels.
She had the looks, the moves,
but what the hell
was she talking about?
[laughter]
I mean, let's take a look.
[laughter]
- Mama, it's not what you say.
It's what you do.
[roars]
Hmm, I kind of
like the smell!
- Kenya, you like the smell
of the beaver,
so don't hold your nose.
- This is a challenge
that you can go and kick ass,
because go, girl, smoke that.
That's my time, you know?
And it's more easy for you
than for me
that I don't speak more English.
It's the only thing that I say.
That's all.
- I understood
about four words of that.
- Whoo!
[cheers and applause]
- Hello, little Kenya.
Hello.
Now, my dear, sometimes it was
difficult to understand...
- I know.
- But tonight
we don't want to miss a thing.
So we've invited
an extra special translator.
Please welcome our biggest
drag professor, Charo.
[cheers and applause]
- Hola.
- Hola.
- Hello, Charo.
Now, Charo,
I need you to ask Kenya
how has everyone in Puerto Rico
responded
to her appearance on our show.
[laughter]
- Right.
- Yes.
- Yeah.
- [speaking Spanish]
[both speaking Spanish]
- Si?
- Ah, yeah.
- [speaking Spanish]
[cheers and applause]
[continues speaking Spanish]
[both speaking Spanish]
- Si, si.
- [continues speaking Spanish]
- Si, si.
Um...
[laughter]
Well, I tell you what, Charo.
Let's ask her one more question.
Please ask her
if she was surprised
that we brought her back
to the show.
- Right.
[speaking Spanish]
- Jodera...
[speaking Spanish]
I'm so excited, girl.
[speaking Spanish]
Baby, it's not what you say.
It's what you do.
[cheers and applause]
- Right, I kinda understood
the last part, but could you--
could you translate the first
part of that, Charo?
What'd she say?
- RuPaul, I'm very confused.
I cannot understand
a word that bitch say.
[laughter]
[cheers and applause]
- Well, Kenya,
you are a fierce queen
in any language.
And, professor Charo,
so are you.
[cheers and applause]
Kenya, do you cuchi-cuchi?
- No, can you show me, please?
- [speaking Spanish]
- Actually, let's everybody
cuchi-cuchi out to commercial.
[upbeat music]
[cheers and applause]
Welcome back to
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race: Reunited.</i>
Now, before we crown
America's next drag superstar,
there's an important
piece of business
that we need to attend to.
This season, for the first time
in Drag Race history,
a queen was disqualified
from the competition.
Now, rumors have been flying,
but there's one thing
for certain.
There's never been
a more controversial queen.
Let's take a look.
Willam,
it has come to my attention
that you have broken the rules.
Willam, I have to ask you
to leave the competition
immediately.
[cheers and applause]
Ladies and gentlemen,
to set the record straight
about Willam...
you'll have to tune in
to this season's premiere
of<i> RuPaul's Drag U,</i>
coming this summer on Logo.
[audience groans]
Just kidding.
J.K., Miss Thing.
[laughter]
Please welcome back Willam.
[cheers and applause]
Now, Willam, I want the answer
to the question
everyone is dying to know.
Audience, let's say it together.
all: What did Willam do?
What did Willam do?
What did Willam do?
- What didn't I do?
[laughter]
- No, seriously,
I want you to take a deep breath
and break it down for me, okay?
- When you go away to<i> Drag Race,</i>
you can't tell anybody.
It's top secret.
And I told my husband
I was doing
a non-union horror movie
in Europe,
which I've done before,
and they suck,
so don't watch them.
And he didn't believe me.
He's like, "Why you gotta
take all this drag?"
So I lied, and he followed me
to the hotel.
And then the first night
he knocked on my door,
and it was a delivery.
- So in other words,
you were receiving
conjugal visits
from your husband,
and unfortunately
that was a violation
of the rules.
- Visiting makes it sound like
we were visiting.
There wasn't no talking.
- [laughs]
- But they were
very long visits.
He's 6'6".
- Oh, yes, yes.
Listen, I was disappointed
to see you go
and so were your fans.
[cheering]
- Thank you.
- I want you to know that
I really, really believe in you.
And actually I thought you had
a chance to go all the way.
[cheers and applause]
Do you have any regrets?
- Um...
I was gonna be flippant,
but after hearing you say that,
um...I regret that...
I maybe--
I should win next time.
- [laughs]
- Well, Willam, I have one
last question to ask.
- Sure.
- And this is
a serious question.
- All right.
- Do you have anything to plug?
- I have my new single,
the<i> WDWD Doot-Doot Trouble</i><span style="bodyStyle"> mix</i>
on iTunes.
And here's a little sticker.
- Oh, great, thank you.
- Yeah, and they're scented too.
They smell like a sticker.
- Oh, yeah, they do.
Yeah, yeah.
Willam, I expect great things
from you in the future,
so keep breaking the rules,
mama.
Just don't break my rules, okay?
- No, your show, your rules.
- That's right.
This next queen won our hearts
and made us cry
and redefined
the meaning of the word "bitch,"
being in total control
of herself.
I'm talking about
Latrice motherfucking Royale.
Let's take a look.
[cheers and applause]
- You have changed my life
forever.
You have changed the world
of drag forever.
Thank you for seeing
something special in me.
Thank you.
[cheers and applause]
- [laughs]
Now, I wanna ask you, Latrice,
how has<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i>
changed your life?
- I am not the same.
I mean, the overwhelming
response that I'm getting,
the outpour of love
that I'm getting,
I never expected
to get all this.
I mean, really.
But I truly am humbled by it.
I thank you so much.
I definitely feel that, um,
I'm inspired
to keep on keeping on
because doing me works.
[cheers and applause]
- Now, you were very open
about your prison background.
Do you regret letting the world
know about that?
- No, that was the most
liberating thing
that I ever coulda done.
I want people to realize that
it's okay to make mistakes.
It's okay to fall down.
Get up, look sickening,
and make them eat it.
[cheers and applause]
- I hear that you brought
a letter from a fan.
- I did.
I did it just so--
if it's not all wet.
- Oh.
- Moist.
- Ew, dear.
- Delicious.
- Oh, okay.
- Says, "Hi, Latrice.
"I just wanted to tell you
what a role model you have been
"for my ten-year-old daughter
Katherine.
"We get in bed
every Monday night together
"and watch the Drag Race.
"She's been dealing with
some bullying issues,
"but lately she's been
channeling her inner Latrice
and showing those bitches
the door."
[cheers and applause]
"When I drop her off at school
in the morning,
"I tell her,
'You be fierce, mama.'
"Much love.
Rock on.
Gina from Florida."
- That is lovely.
I love it.
Well, of course you haven't
seen the last of Latrice.
I'm very excited to announce
that she's joining the faculty
of<i> Drag U</i><span style="bodyStyle"> this summer</i>
right here on Logo TV
and logotv.com.
Give it up for
Latrice motherfucking Royale.
[cheers and applause]
The shade, the shade of it all.
The shade, the shade, the shade.
Ha, it's fabulous.
Gorgeous.
[cheers and applause]
Welcome back to
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race: Reunited.</i>
Last week, our top three queens
were lip syncing for their lives
to my single<i> Glamazon,</i>
available on iTunes and Amazon.
[cheers and applause]
Tonight they're dying
to find out
who will be crowned
America's next drag superstar.
Please welcome back to the stage
the top three.
[cheers and applause]
My girls, my girls.
Can you feel the love tonight?
- Oh, it's incredible.
- Fabulous.
- It's "phierce" with a "p-h".
- Yes.
- Sharon, Phi Phi,
for most of the season
the two of you hated each other.
Why?
- Well, who first?
- It's really hard
for me to hate someone,
and it's really easy for me
just to get along with anyone
when I can just find
a redeeming quality.
Unfortunately,
it was really hard for me
to find a redeeming quality.
I mean, that's--
[cheers and applause]
- And Phi Phi, uh, why did you
hate Sharon so much?
- I did feel that a lot of times
instead of talking to me
as a person,
she was talking down to me
or at me,
and I don't take that very well.
But, I mean, I love her and
I respect what she does and--
- Bullshit.
[cheers and applause]
- Now, Chad,
you defended Phi Phi
for most of the season.
- I did.
- How do you feel about her now?
- As I watched the season
from home,
I realized that there were times
when I wasn't around that
Phi Phi really
let her ass hang out,
and, um, a lot happened
when I wasn't there.
And I literally felt like I was
walking around in a cloud.
Specifically setting up
Jiggly to fail.
Um, well, trying to set up
Willam to go home
by having Latrice
throw the contest.
And then the thing that just
left me really unsettled,
Phi Phi, in the Gold Bar,
when you came for Willam
it wasn't an attack
on his talent,
and it wasn't an attack on
what he was doing at the show.
It was a personal attack.
And I just--
I just felt as though
you could have behaved
a little bit better.
But that's my opinion, baby.
- And I complete--
I completely understand
where you're coming from,
and I do--
I watch the show now
and I see that--
watching, I'm like,
oh, I'm insane.
[laughter]
And, um, I just felt sometimes
that you guys were attacking me,
and so maybe that was
my defense mechanism.
- I wanna hear from
some of the other queens.
Do you have anything to say
to any of our top three queens?
Jiggly?
- This hurts a lot.
Phi Phi, me and you,
we supposed to be road dogs.
We supposed to be sisters.
You came to my crib.
You chilled with me.
And for me to see that
like that at--
damn, girl, I swear to god.
Ooh, I just felt betrayed.
And you always were like,
"You can lean on me
and you can lean on me,"
and then that.
I felt like a sucker.
And I'm supposed to be
your sister?
That shit ain't cool with me.
- You know,
I completely apologize
if that hurt you in any way,
but when I signed on
to this show--
and people might not
agree to it--
I signed in to win $100,000
and a crown.
- Honestly, like, I think--
I'm an egomaniac.
Everybody knows that.
But, like, she should be studied
down there.
I don't understand it.
It's almost sociopathic the way
she'll tell people, um,
"It was just a character.
I was just playing it up."
And then she'll sign autographs,
"Fuck Willam, fuck Sharon."
It's not cool.
And I understand
that it's a game.
I never retaliated on the show
because I didn't care
and indifference
is worse than hate.
And I'm not gonna "RuPaulogize"
for anything that I'm doing now.
[cheers and applause]
- Oh, bitch.
Oh, bitch.
Consider that word stolen,
honey.
[cheers and applause]
My new album will be called
"RuPaulogize" on iTunes.
[cheers and applause]
All right, ladies,
it's time to find out
which one of you bitches
will be named Miss Congeniality.
Oh, pit crew.
[cheers and applause]
The fans have spoken.
And this year's
Miss Congeniality is...
[audience shouting, cheering]
Latrice Royale.
[cheers and applause]
[upbeat music]
Condragulations, Latrice.
You've won a round trip
first class flight
and legendary
hotel accommodations
anywhere in the U.S.A.
courtesy of orbitz.com.
[cheers and applause]
[cheers and applause]
Welcome back to
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race: Reunited.</i>
My girls, Chad Michaels,
Sharon Needles,
and Phi Phi O'Hara,
in a moment
one of you will be crowned
America's next drag superstar.
First up, Chad Michaels.
Now, you've impressed everyone
with your grace
and professionalism.
Chad, I want to know
how you're feeling right now.
- This has meant a lot to me,
and just to be here with this
incredible group of friends
and with you, Ru,
I'm galvanized, I'm focused,
and I'm ready to
take home the crown tonight.
[cheers and applause]
- Now, do you have
someone special
here tonight rooting for you?
- You know I do.
I have my partner, Adam Magee.
He's right over here.
- Hi.
[cheers and applause]
- So, Adam.
- Yes?
- Now, you design out--
did you design this outfit?
- From head to toe, sweetheart.
- Really?
[cheers and applause]
Gorgeous.
I'll have one in every color.
[laughter]
Now, Chad, I want to ask you:
What would it mean for you
to become America's
next drag superstar?
- It would be a personal test
that I put on myself
that I passed.
It would be showing me
what I'm made of.
It would be justifying
all the support that I have had
over the last 20 years of--
basically I get to
play dress up for a living
and walk around the stage
and move my lips.
I think lastly, Ru, for me
and for so many entertainers
across the country
it would be my honor
and my privilege
to represent<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i>
and to work for you, mama.
[cheers and applause]
- Chad Michaels,
I want to thank you
for elevating this
beautiful race to the highest.
You are a class act.
- Thank you, Ru.
Thank you, thank you.
[cheers and applause]
- All right, up next,
Sharon Needles.
[cheers and applause]
Now, Sharon, you've become
quite the cult figure.
How does it feel?
- It's humbling
because, you know,
I came here, you know, to show,
you know, the underbelly
and the underground outsider
art side of drag
and try and get $100,000
doing it,
and now it's become
a full-time job
and a responsibility
to so many young people.
I get hundreds of letters
a week.
I never thought I would
touch people like that.
[cheers and applause]
- Now, you have
some special people
here tonight to cheer you on.
- I do.
I have my girlfriend
with a penis, Alaska.
[cheers and applause]
And I also have my
mommy dearest, Joan craw--
or excuse me,
Joan Coady right there.
[cheers and applause]
- Was he a spooky child?
- Well, he's always been a fan
of horror movies
and Halloween in general.
In our house, Halloween costumes
didn't come out of a box.
And the last unspooky costume
I remember was the scarecrow
from<i> The Wizard of Oz.</i>
So from then on it's just been
zombies and bloody things.
- [laughs]
What would it mean for you
to be America's
next drag superstar?
- Well, first it would be
such a great honor.
Being the holder of the crown
would show that you don't
have to fit a certain mold
to make it in any industry
or in any desire that you want.
And for any gay kid out there
or just weird kid
that gets picked on,
just know, you know,
when in doubt, freak them out.
Do whatever the fuck
you wanna do, and--
[cheers and applause]
And if anyone
ever boos you offstage,
that is simply
applause from ghosts.
You remember that.
- [laughs]
[audience boos]
- I love it.
[cheers and applause]
- Up next, Phi Phi O'Hara.
[cheers and applause]
No one has been in it to win it
more than you have,
and that drive has propelled you
into the top three.
Now, what's the best thing
to come out of the experience?
- As many haters as I have,
I would definitely have to say
that the fans,
the fans that I do have,
because, granted I came in here
to win the $100,000,
a crown, title of
America's next drag superstar,
but I wanted to be the backbone
and strength
for a lot of those kids
that had to go through,
like, a child abuse past
and stuff like that
and just have that person
that they could look up to
that I didn't have as a child.
- Right,
now you've been very honest
about your relationship
with your father.
And have things improved
since the show aired?
- No.
- Does he know
you've done the show?
- Yeah.
Um...
I know he watches it, and, um,
and I know he doesn't like it.
But I love me.
And, um--
[cheers and applause]
If I can show any kids out there
to be strong
and, um, live life for yourself
and just be happy,
make sure that at the end of the
day when you go to bed,
as long as you love yourself
and you're proud
of everything that you did,
fuck what everybody else says.
[cheers and applause]
- So, Phi Phi, who's here
rooting for you tonight?
- The person
I look up to the most,
um, my beautiful mother.
[applause]
- And what's your mom's name?
- That's Rhonda.
- Hi, Rhonda.
What do you think of Phi Phi?
- I think he's beautiful.
I just think that the judges
made a call right
when they said he may of wore
a little bit too much makeup.
[laughter]
- Shut up.
- But he toned it down,
and he looks great.
He looks just like me.
[laughter]
[cheers and applause]
- Phi Phi,
what would it mean to you
to be crowned
America's next drag superstar?
- Money in the bank.
[laughter]
And, um, like I said, a voice.
I just want to show people that
you can fight for anything that
you want,
and never let anybody stop you
because if you want it,
you can make it happen.
- Thank you, Phi Phi.
And I just want to say,
watching you
in this competition grow
and be such a fighter has just
really been amazing.
And no matter what anybody says,
you are fantastic,
and you deserve
to be in this race, okay?
Let's give
a big round of applause
for our top three.
[cheers and applause]
Welcome back to<i> RuPaul's</i>

from the bottom of my heart
any one of these queens
will represent you
and your show flawlessly.
- Thank you.
[cheers and applause]
All right, Santino and Billy B,
what do you think?
- We have just one more thing
to say.
both: Good luck
and don't fuck it up.
[cheers and applause]
- Thank you, judges.
I want you to know
from the bottom of my heart
you are the air beneath my foot.

Chad Michaels...

I've consulted with you,
the fans,
but the final decision

- I love you, Ru.
[cheering continues]
- My queen.
Sharon, is there anything
you'd like to say?
- Happy Halloween, everybody.
[cheers and applause]
- Listen,
if you can't love yourself,
how in the hell you gonna love
somebody else?
Can I get an "amen" up in here?
all: Amen!
- All right, let the music play.

-<i> Previously on</i>
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race...</i>
It's time to make
some her-story.
- How you doing?
- Yee-haw.
- Change for the Ritz.
- Everyone needs
peace with Latrice.
- I am of the people
and for the people.
I'm Sharon Needles
for sharing responsibilities.
- Condragulations.
You are the winner
of this challenge.
Latrice Royale,
shantay, you stay.
Dida Ritz, sashay away.
- Thank you.
- Once again,
I've been criticized
for sending some of my queens
home too soon.
Michelle, I want you
to confer with Santino
to decide which one
of the eliminated queens...
deserves to return.
- No, bitch, top four.
No mo' hos.
-<i> And tonight...</i>
<i>the dolls meet their mamas.</i>
- Whoa.
- Man.
-<i> And it ain't pretty.</i>
- You okay?
-<i> With extra-special</i>
<i>guest judges</i>
<i>Jesse Tyler Ferguson</i>
<i>and Jennifer love Hewitt.</i>
[cheers and applause]
<i>The winner of</i>
RuPaul's Drag Race
<i>will receive a lifetime</i>
<i>supply of NYX cosmetics,</i>
<i>a one-of-a-kind trip</i>

<i>headline Logo's Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> Tour</i>

<i>and a cash prize of $100,000.</i>
And may the best woman win.
- God.
- What?
- Oh.
- Don't what me.
Cluck-cluck, top four.
- What does it say?
- "Stay true.
Chad, Needles, Latrice."
- Dida's gone, but she left
a little piece of herself
for us to remember her.
- all: Cheesecake!
- I'm gonna miss Dida.
She was fierce!
- She was fierce.
- [indistinct]
- Love her.
- I had so much fun
getting to know her.
- We--yeah,
me and Dida connected.
<i>It's a bittersweet situation.</i>
<i>Yeah, one more bitch</i>
<i>is out the door,</i>
but Dida was my girl.
- Were you nervous?
- You know, I thought
I was gonna be really nervous,
but after, like,
the first beat kicked in,
bitch, I was craving
for some show action.
- You were good.
You put Dida straight to bed.
You took us to church, she
took us to a Beyoncé concert.
- Which is fine, but not
for Gladys Knight.
- Sometimes girls
give too much energy
for a song that just needs
some delicate, soulful moves.
- That's it.
- You gave it.
- So congratulations, Needles.
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah, your third win.
- Oh, stop!
- Okay, so let's say this right
now so it's really official.
We are...
- all: The top four.
- So some shit's gonna go down.
- No.
-<i> There will be a departed queen</i>
returning to the competition
this morning.
Who do you think it's gonna be?
- Bringing anyone back
isn't fair in my opinion.
- We should make up some
shirts or some shit.
- Shirts, or, like, signs.
- Signs.
- Yes.
- Top four. Add no more.
- Let's do this, honey.
Let's get it all going.
This sucks,
and we're protesting.
Top four. Add no more.
[siren wails]
- Oh, let's go.
<i>- Ooh, girl.</i>
<i>You got she-mail.</i>
<i>Ladies, this competition</i>
<i>is still pregnant</i>
<i>with possibilities.</i>
<i>And soon a star will be born.</i>
<i>But will it be a labor of love</i>
<i>or a bastard of disaster?</i>
<i>Time to push, ladies.</i>
<i>Push!</i>
<i>'Cause I'm about to crown...</i>
<i>[moans]</i>
<i>America's next drag superstar.</i>
<i>I hope it's a queen.</i>
<i>[giggles]</i>
Hello, hello, hello.
- all: [chanting]
Top four. Add no more.
Top four. Add no more.
Top four. Add no more.
- Whoo!
- Nice try, Norma Rae.
But this week we are celebrating
the modern drag family,
starting with the return
of one of your soul sisters.
Ladies, please welcome back...
Oh, the suspense is killing me.
[cheers]
-<i> Kenya Michaels is back.</i>
- She's a force
to be reckoned with.
She can dance, and she's pretty.
And that's exactly
what we don't need right now.
- Welcome home, mama.
- Yeah, I'm ready.
I'm back in the building.
<i>I'm ready to compete.</i>
So let's prepare, ladies.
- Oh, pit crew.
For today's mini challenge,
you need to get crafty
and turn these papa bears
into mama bears.
You'll have 20 minutes
to drag out your teddy bear.
The one queen with the most
unbearably beautiful critter
will win.
Ready, set, growl.
Whoo-hoo.
- Better make
your spook bear, bitch.
Spoo...kity.
- Sorry, Kenya, we've lost
our fucking minds.
- Look what you left me with.
Now I'm not the youngest or
the shortest or the fishiest.
- And you never will be,
Blanche.
And you never were.
[laughs]
- Okay, ladies, time's up.
Let's take a look
at your lady bears.
- RuPaul, meet Malibu Bearbie.
- She's very Jiggly Caliente.
- Yes.
[laughter]
- May I call you Jiggly?
Next up, Sharon Needles.
The bride of Chucky wore black.
- She's part
of the Scare Bear collection.
I let her borrow my contacts.
- So who do we have here?
- We have La Transbear.
- Are those pasties
she has there?
- Yeah, her pasties are sexy.
- She is a fishy bear,
and bears love fish.
- This is Portia the Pooh.
- I see that her face
is bejeweled.
- Like mother, like daughter.
- This is Princess Bitch Bear.
She comes complete
with a set of accessories.
- Booger Bear.
- Those are all
jealous bears over there.
- Ladies, one bear
is creating a panda-monium.
The winner of today's
mini challenge is...
Lil' Kenya Michaels.
- Yay.
-<i> Yes, I win.</i>
La Transbear.
- But, ladies, you can all
be proud of your work,
because all
of your dragged-out bears
will be auctioned off
by the Bear to Make
a Difference Project...
- all: Aww.
- Which supports
the Matthew Shepard Foundation's
effort to erase hate.
Can I get a amen in here?
- all: Amen.
- ["elderly" voice] Ladies,
when I was growing up,
a man went to work...
[normal] And left his wife
at home to raise the children.
But in today's modern families,
we expect a lot more
from our father figures.
Now, to prove my point,
I want you to meet some DILFs.
Or dads I'd like to frock.
[laughter]
- Whoa.
<i>Truck-driving, burly men, like,</i>
for real, for real.
[chuckles]
- Ladies, for today's
main challenge,
you need to transform
these handsome daddies
into sexy drag queen mamas.
All right, dads,
please introduce yourselves.
- I'm Leland,
the father of six.
- Six?
- Yes.
- Damn, Leland.
- Hi, I'm Rick, and I have
a beautiful daughter.
She's six years old.
And a beautiful son.
He's four years old.
- My name's James.
I have a beautiful
two-year-old daughter.
- My name's Chris.
I'm a proud father
of two beautiful girls.
- My name is Mike.
I have six children
and five grandchildren.
- Wow, so you're a grandfather
I'd like to frock.
- I am.
- All right, Lil' Kenya.
Since you won the mini
challenge,
you get to pick a daddy
for each of the other girls.
- You go with Chad Michaels.
- I'm looking at Kenya,
and I'm kind of doing,
like, the eye thing,
so that way she knows,
like, to send the guy
this way or this way.
- You're gonna go...
- When she comes
to pick out my guy,
I just give her,
like, a little nod,
so that way she just comes
and gives me my guy.
- With Phi Phi.
Um...
You're gonna be spooky.
- Okay.
- Hi.
Sharon Needles.
- The guy that I have been given
has the brickest face
in the bunch.
He's too manly to be pretty.
- How are you?
- Good.
- Leland is with Latrice.
So, Lil' Kenya,
who's your daddy?
- This is my daddy.
- [giggles]
- My guy is the most
beautiful woman.
Because he's gonna look
like Jessica Wild something.
- Now you can use your own drag,
plus extra materials and hair,
courtesy of Risque Wigs.
Now I'm expecting to see
a strong family resemblance.
And tomorrow, on the main stage,
to keep things in a family way,
you and your daddy mama
will be carrying
a bun in the oven.
- [laughs]
- That's right.
The category is...
baby bump realness.
-<i> It's one thing</i>
<i>to put these dads in drag.</i>
<i>But now it got to be</i>
<i>maternity clothes?</i>
<i>You gonna be pregnant?</i>
Ugh.
- Okay, little mamas,
your charisma, uniqueness,
nerve, and talent
got you into this situation.
Now you need to use it
to turn it out.
Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best mother win.
- All right, come on.
- How do you call--
what do you call 'em?
- These are sequins.
- Sequins.
- I didn't even know
they made stuff like this.
- Is that your cell phone in
your pants
or are you just happy to see me?
- Nope.
- Okay.
Didn't told me I was
in the movie<i> Anaconda.</i>
What's going on here?
- Oh, my God.
This one's a freak.
Mike-o the Psycho is so weird.
- Ooh, baby.
- [chuckles]
- He makes me want to run
and take a shower immediately.
- You single?
- Not today.
- Sharon's DILF
looks freakin' insane.
He's like<i> the</i>
<i>Silence of the Lambs</i><span style="bodyStyle"> killer.</i>
- So we got to get you pregnant.
- Why do we have to be pregnant?
Today we have to turn DILFs
into MILFs--
<i>pregnant, glamorous MILFs.</i>
- Man.
Ugh.
- You have to get rid
of your manhood.
- But that will hurt.
- No, it doesn't hurt.
- If you push 'em
up inside you--
- Nah, it's--
that's where they go.
- Ooh!
- It's either that or you can
sit on 'em, and that's not--
- Sit on--oh, shit, no!
- Exactly, so...
- You can't--you tape it to your
leg or something like that?
[laughing]
- You gonna be serving
moose knuckles.
- So they want to see,
like, the transformation,
like, the difference.
And you'd look like a dude.
- Pretty manly man.
- I get paired up with Chris,
and I'm super excited,
because he's really
getting into this.
- I'm down to go all the way.
- Awesome.
- I want to win this shit.
- It's kind of fun
teaching a straight guy
how to be me.
- How you doing?
- Pretty good, you?
- Good.
- Don't talk to my dad.
- I can talk to your dad
if I want.
- All right?
Maybe your dad likes me better.
- He wants to be on the winning
team, so I doubt it.
- Yeah.
'Cause we're gonna win.
- You like that?
He even talks like Phi Phi.
- I was like,
"You're just like me."
That's what I like, 'cause
that way I can school these hos.
- Phi Phi loves to come for me,
and she can come for me
all she wants.
Come for me, baby.
<i>However,</i>
<i>I have to stay focused.</i>
What I'm producing
has to be perfect.
- No, that's way too bright.
I don't like the fact
that it's so long.
- 'Cause I'm thinking,
like, right about here.
Show some hip.
- He could chill out
just a little bit,
'cause I do know
what I'm doing,
and I don't need
too much direction.
- I want, like, a four-inch...
Bam!
- Walk.
Come on, walk.
Okay.
Okay, don't bounce.
Don't do that.
No, don't do that.
Okay, come on.
Walk, walk.
How you feel?
- Like, it--
it just--
Is that how they usually feel?
Like, hurting here?
- Yeah.
All the time.
- All the time?
- Yeah, all the time.
- My toes are
like this right now.
[laughs]
Yeah, I know,
because you have a men feet.
[laughing]
- Ah, fuck,
these shoes fucking hurt.
- Walk in the fucking heels
and then shut up!
- I might as well
level with you.
- Yeah.
- All these girls here
are like classic beauty queens.
I like to look kind of, like,
half dead most of the time.
- Who am I to judge anybody?
- Do you have both your shoes?
- The way I look at it,
go big or stay home.
- Right.
- Right?
- Agreed.
<i>- Sharon Needles' DILF</i>
<i>is really, really</i>
<i>rough in the face.</i>
- Well, what do you
do for a living?
What makes you so strong?
- I was a sheriff's deputy.
- Oh! I see.
Law enforcement?
- So don't step out of line
or I'm gonna throw
the handcuffs on you.
- Oh, got it, got it.
Challenges either
go two ways with me:
I either feel
ridiculously confident...
- No, no.
Don't be so out.
- Yeah, you don't want
to walk like that.
-<i> Or I know I'm up the shit</i>
<i>crick without a paddle.</i>
Feel your ass
going back and forth.
<i>- Wow.</i>
<i>Sharon, mama,</i>
you may be in trouble.
- Foot in front of foot,
crossing over.
- Sharon, he walks
just like you already, girl.
[laughing]
- Hello, hello, hello!
- Hey, Ru.
- Oh, Ru!
- Well, hello, Phi Phi.
- Hi, Ru.
- And Chris.
Apparently you're
making your outfits?
- We want to be,
like, sexy moms.
We're gonna have, like, fun,
flirty little pregnant dresses.
- You've been criticized
for proportions.
- I'll be fine.
It'll work.
I get worried when you do that,
"Oh, it's gonna be fine."
- I know you do.
- "It'll work. It'll work.
It'll be fine."
Remember, there have been times
when you've done that
and it didn't work.
Now, do you think
you have enough time
to finish sewing these outfits?
- Yeah.
It's not gonna take long.
There's that thing again.
"It'll be fine."
- Stop it!
No, we're gonna be good.
- Get to sewing.
- All righty.
Thank you, Ru.
- All right.
- Hi, Leland.
Hi, Latrice.
- Hello, Ru.
- Will you be wearing
matching gowns?
- Um, well...
- We're looking
for a family resemblance.
- Absolutely.
- Yeah.
- But it's gonna
work out, I think.
- So, Leland,
what are you most nervous about?
- Walking in them shoes.
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.
- You play sports at all?
- I used to.
- Yeah, well, because, honestly,
it has to do with
your center of gravity
and knowing your body
and your hand-eye coordination.
- Still ain't got no
coordination for basketball
with dribbling and--no, no.
- Right. Hmm.
All right, Royale sisters,
you have a lot of work to do.
I'm gonna leave you to it.
- Thank you, Ru.
- All right.
- Hey, Rick.
- Hi.
- Hey, Lil' Kenya.
You look like Elvis.
Do people tell you that?
- My mom told me I look
like a young Elvis, yeah.
- Now you're gonna look
like Lisa Marie Presley.
Have you picked
a drag name for Rick?
- She gonna be my Lil' Mama.
- Lil' Mama.
- Because I'm Lil' Kenya.
[laughs]
- How do you feel
about that, Lil' Mama?
- Uh...I don't feel
like a little mama.
- Well, listen,
you got a lot of work to do.
Let them have it.
- Bye.
- Hey, Chad.
- Hey, RuPaul.
- Wow, look at this.
- Isn't that fun?
- Yeah, it was both our idea.
We're both very technical people
when we start out--
"Is it off? It is doing this?
Doing that?"
- He's taking a very
active role in this,
and he's very assertive.
- Now you've been doing this
for a long time.
Can you look at James' face
and tell what he's
gonna look like
just based on bone structure?
- Yeah, he's gonna be pretty.
- Really?
- We'll see.
- I'm gonna let you get
back to it, okay?
- Thank you.
- Mike and Sharon Needles.
- Hello.
- How are you two kids
getting along?
Mike, you're getting into it
early, aren't you?
- Oh.
<i>I'm embarrassed by Mike</i>
because he seems
to have no filter.
- Why'd you decide to do this?
- 'Cause I want to bring out
my inner diva.
The only problem I have
with this outfit
is I think I'm having a baby
elephant.
You want to see his trunk?
- You kids have your work
cut out for you.
I'm gonna let you
get back to it.
Good luck taming Mike.
- Thank you so much, Ru.
- Gather round.
Ladies and gentlemen,
tomorrow night we'll be joined
by our extra-special
guest judges,
one of TV's favorite dads...
<i>Modern Family's</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
Jesse Tyler Ferguson.
- Yeah!
- He's cute as a button.
- And the always lovely
Miss Jennifer Love Hewitt.
[gasps and exclamations]
But before you have a baby...
there needs to be
a little seduction.
So tomorrow, prior to your baby
bump runway presentation,
each couple needs
to get us in the mood
with a sexy striptease.
- What?
- Insane.
- And, in the words
of my sainted mother...
God damn it, you pussy-mouthed
motherfuckers...
Don't fuck it up.
- Welcome to the runway.
- Awesome.
- It's time for me and James
to do our striptease,
and I'm a little apprehensive.
- We just have to figure out
how to make it sexy,
'cause it's supposed to be
like a striptease.
That's not turning me on yet,
dude.
-<i> I figured, with James,</i>
<i>since he doesn't have</i>
<i>a lot of experience,</i>
<i>you keep it simple.</i>
Walk out, looking at each other.
Then let's hit.
So your arm's gonna go up on--
your right arm.
And you know how I like
to be perfect, darling.
Boom, and then throw it.
You've never stripped before,
I'm sure.
- No.
- You've been
to a strip joint, though.
- Yeah.
- Lap dance?
- Oh, yeah.
- Tipping?
- Yeah.
- Poles?
- Yeah.
- All of it. All right.
Hold right, and then boom.
Perfect.
Real sexy, hands on hips.
Right to the X right here.
Pose. Perfect.
Just work your sexiness.
Like this. Look.
Ah.
- Okay.
- Perfect.
Just up. Perfect.
Give me five, brother.
- Got it.
- That's my man.
- You're gonna win.
- I hope so.
- So cross out.
- Wait, wait,
I didn't even cross.
I think I feel like
I'm walking off the stage.
- One, two, three, four.
Five, six...
- Oh, fuck.
That's all right, I got to
get used to the spin.
- It's kind of difficult
to transform, like,
a big, old, macho straight guy
into, like,
a real feminine woman.
Five, six, grab it.
Seven, eight.
- Five, six.
Oh, no, wait.
-<i> No, that's clearly a dude.</i>
- I feel like I'm
doing the Hulkamania.
Rrr!
[chuckles]
- Do you know what fishy means?
Like a girl.
Like, "ay!"
- Yeah!
- Kiss. Boom.
- Boom.
- No, you said boom after me.
That means you're
not timing with me.
- Uh...
back?
I know I should have saved my
brain cells when I was a kid.
- That's no excuse.
Turning. Now what?
- I'm fucking brain-dead, dude.
- I want to kill him,
<i>because I have created</i>
<i>the most simplest,</i>
<i>cheapest routine</i>
that Helen Keller could do
on the first try.
Can you skip?
- Nope.
- I'm panicking.
- I suck. It is what it is.
- Don't say, "it is what it is,"
'cause it's my 100,000
fucking dollars.
I need to make sure
that he's giving 100%.
<i>But I don't think</i>
<i>I'm going to get it.</i>
- You okay?
- It's coming alive now.
There she go.
You know who you look like
right now?
Rick James.
[laughter]
- You're trying to make me look
like Teena Marie, though.
[laughter]
- Hold on.
I dropped my bush.
-<i> Sharon's DILF</i>
<i>is a cross-dressing,</i>
support-group-needing dad.
- Mm.
[inhales]
- No, no, no, no.
We don't fetishize the clothes.
- He's a little bit
too comfortable,
if you know what I mean.
- What if one of your daughters
grew up to be gay?
What would you tell them?
- I wouldn't care.
- You wouldn't care at all?
- No.
Even if I had a son.
- That's good.
- It is what it is.
- But that's good
that you wouldn't
shun your kids or anything.
My dad, he didn't
like it at all.
- That sucks.
- I haven't talked to him
since I was, like, 18.
- One day he'll realize
what he's not being part of.
-<i> It's really cool to talk</i>
<i>to someone that, you know,</i>
they're straight but they see
how my lifestyle is
and it's okay to be who I am.
If you had a son,
would you have him audition
for<i> RuPaul's Drag Race?</i>
- No, 'cause he'll probably do
a better job than I do.
- Do you have a boyfriend?
- I do. Yeah.
- How long?
- Eight years, and I was here
during our anniversary.
- On our eighth-year
anniversary,
we renewed our vows.
- Well, we might renew our vows
if we can ever get married.
- Why call it a marriage
if you're gonna
offend so many people?
- It's making everybody equal.
Say I've been together
with somebody for 40 years.
Say I get sick.
I go into the hospital.
They can't come visit me,
because they're not
related to me in any way.
So that's what
we're fighting for.
- That's what you're
standing up and saying.
- That would kill me to know,
if I was sick,
laying in a bed somewhere,
that Adam couldn't come see me.
No, it's cool.
I just, you know.
It just comes up, you know.
It's like--just to know that,
God, he would be locked out
and that he would be
left with nothing.
- I don't believe
that's fair at all.
I support you guys.
Everybody should have the right
to love who they want
to love, you know?
- You expect me to walk up
on this thing in these?
- Yeah.
Put on them shoes, boo-boo.
- [groans]
I can't even
walk on it barefoot.
Ooh. [laughs]
[exhales]
Okay.
- Tell me you got some rhythm.
- I got some rhythm, but I don't
know if I got any sexiness.
Oh!
<i>- I need sexy swagger.</i>
<i>I need hips and ass,</i>
and he don't have
none of that going.
- Whoa.
- You're okay with your shoes?
- Yeah.
Do I need 'em right now?
- You have to practice.
Come on.
One and two, the chair.
The legs.
Ha, ha, ha.
I do the split.
He need to be sexy.
Come on.
One more time.
Five, six, seven.
[speaks indistinctly]
<i>Rick is a hot guy,</i>
<i>but he's not a dancer.</i>
- That's it?
- Oh, my god.
- Pfft!
- One, two, three, four.
It's the end of the day,
<i>and I'm panicking,</i>
<i>because we have</i>
<i>a short window of time</i>
to get something so simple done.
Since you're strong,
what if I turned around
and you caught me?
- Yeah, let's make it
more difficult.
- Yeah.
- Ladies, can you vacate
our runway, please?
- "Vacate our runway."
- Get the fuck off our runway.
- We're better off than them.
- Don't make up excuses why
you guys are inferior to us.
- Well, their dance techniques
are bitchin'.
- Not really.
- A little bit
too much testosterone
running around here, sunshine.
- Why are you getting
such a bad attitude right now?
- Because I got
my diva bitch attitude,
and we're gonna win it,
and you guys
need to just stay home.
- Oh, I get it,
it's your diva bitch attitude.
- Yeah, just stay home.
- Bitch, I didn't come here
to stay home, "ossifer".
What?
What are you gonna do to me?
Beat my skinny ass up?
Go for it.
I don't give a shit.
I'll fucking put you
in jail too.
- Know what's funny, is nobody
laughs at your shit but you.
Can't take it, huh?
<i>- Mike's in our space.</i>
<i>It's not the locker room.</i>
I don't need all that,
like, macho bullsh--crap.
<i>It's completely out of line</i>
<i>and I'm not having it.</i>
- I hope it isn't your last day
here tomorrow.
- But you know what,
you're not gonna fucking come up
in my motherfucking workroom
and talk to me like this,<i> sir.</i>
- I just did, didn't I?
- Well, you know what, maybe you
need to be fucking removed
with your badass
motherfucking attitude.
Fuck that shit.
Sharon.
- You're gonna let this
bitch talk to me like this?
- Oh, I'm a bitch now?
- Do not call my sister a bitch.
<i>I'm working with a DILK--</i>
a dad I'd like to kill.
- Cluck-cluck, ladies.
- Good morning, everybody.
- Y'all are gonna be women.
<i>- We're back</i>
<i>in the workroom today,</i>
<i>and I have to get myself</i>
<i>in drag, my dad in drag,</i>
and we have to get
ready for the runway.
- I stirred
the shit up yesterday.
I wanted to give 'em
something to think about.
A little drag queen drama.
- Inescapable.
- So let me ask you a question.
Were you ever bullied in school?
- Oh, my God,
are you kidding me?
It was terrible.
You know, they'd wait for me
after school
and, like, beat me up.
- I mean, is this anything
you could report to the police?
- I never wanted to report it,
'cause I was embarrassed.
- Man, I'm sorry.
That's got to be
so frickin' hard, man.
You know, I'm learning
a lot about the world.
-<i> As much as I rag on Mike,</i>
<i>he certainly was sympathetic</i>
<i>to the fact that I went through</i>
<i>a lot of hell growing up.</i>
Still doesn't know
how to fucking dance.
- Dude, it's already squashed.
- Yeah, yeah.
I need to put tape.
Let me finish.
- No, I'm not taping my dick.
- Just tuck it back.
It don't feel that bad.
It's okay.
<i>- I remember a friend</i>
<i>in high school tucking</i>
<i>after he saw</i>
Silence of the Lambs.
Ugh!
- Let me see.
<i>Rick can't tuck himself.</i>
I have to...
- What about the balls?
- You can take your dick
from the back and pull up.
- Like that?
- No. More.
- It's gonna look like a tail.
- [laughs]
- Put it on the side
of the balls?
- It's from back.
- I think the balls are too big.
- [laughs]
I'm sorry.
- I'm really glad I didn't have
to kick your ass yesterday.
- It was all in a good time,
you know.
I just--I may have pushed the
envelope a little too far,
but I was totally joking.
- It's all right.
I needed to blow
some steam off anyway.
- Well, it's good.
You can use me for that.
I have a really good poker face.
I was cracking up inside.
- I'm sure you were.
- Ain't no fun
if there ain't no drama.
That's the way I look at it.
- [giggles maniacally]
Hey, guys.
- Hey, Ru.
- Hey, gorgeous.
- Welcome to the main stage
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
Michelle Visage. Hi, mami.
- How are you, baby?
We match tonight.
- And we're all eating
at red lobster.
- Mm-mm.
- Santino Rice.
- Great to be here, Ru.
- And look who
the stork brought.
It's Jesse Tyler Ferguson.
- Hi, Ru.
- Are you ready
to meet my modern family?
- Bring 'em on. All of 'em.
- [laughs]
Jennifer Love Hewitt,
welcome to our blessed event.
- Thank you for having me. Hi.
- Will you be
our drag whisperer?
- Yes.
[laughter]
- This week,
the queens were challenged
to transform real-life daddies
into sexy drag mamas.
They'll perform
a seductive striptease
before they rock-a-bye
the runway
wearing their best
baby bump eleganza.
Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best woman win.
- Whoo-hoo!
- Oh, yeah!
-<i> We're doing the choreography.</i>
Rick know the choreography,
but Rick's not sexy.
-<i> It's like dancing with</i>
<i>Leslie Nielsen in</i><span style="bodyStyle"> Airplane!</i>
<i>That's what I thought</i>
<i>he looked like.</i>
- [laughs]
-<i> Leland's missing</i>
<i>a couple of cues,</i>
<i>but I'm not worried about it.</i>
<i>We're working it out</i>
<i>the best way we can.</i>
- Oh, yeah.
-<i> It's top five,</i>
<i>so the judges</i>
<i>are gonna look for anything</i>
<i>to put us in the bottom,</i>
<i>so I hope that our routine</i>
<i>was good enough to get us by.</i>
[cheers and applause]
- Let the baby
bump parade begin.
- Sharelle and Latrice Royale.
- The water has broken, honey.
- Oh, Lord.
- You better get
Lamaze over here.
- Nine months later.
-<i> If you're part</i>
<i>of the Royale family,</i>
<i>you're definitely</i>
<i>gonna be a glamour girl.</i>
<i>So Leland's looking</i>
<i>very elegant, very lady.</i>
<i>He's looking gorgeous.</i>
- She didn't know
she was pregnant.
Gi Gi and Phi Phi O'Hara.
Ladies, the auditions
for<i> 16 and Pregnant</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
are down the hall.
[laughter]
-<i> Chris and I are basically</i>
<i>just trying to serve</i>
<i>sexy, pregnant MILF realness.</i>
<i>I kind of feel like he was</i>
<i>a drag queen in a past life,</i>
<i>because he's</i>
<i>doing this too good.</i>
- It's a boy.
It's a girl.
It's both.
[laughter]
- Best friends and pregnant.
[laughter]
- Lil' Mama
and Lil' Kenya Michaels.
- Being pregnant's hard.
- Macabre too apparently.
- Yeah.
- We're in this together, mom.
-<i> I know that Rick</i>
<i>gonna be a man,</i>
<i>and I think, okay,</i>
<i>if Rick gonna be a man,</i>
<i>gonna be a beautiful man.</i>
- Khloe and Kourtney Kardashian.
- It is.
- Next up, Robin Mansions
and Sharon Needles.
Honey, they're having
Rosemary's Baby.
- My other eye
is my good judgment eye.
-<i> Me and Robin are serving up</i>
<i>filthy-ass bad girls.</i>
<i>Who slept with Robin?</i>
<i>Who got her pregnant?</i>
- Is this morning sickness
or is she gagging on her beauty?
- Apparently, Marilyn Manson
does have a uterus.
- Lady Samantha
and Chad Michaels.
Now, that is an immaculate
misconception.
- Paris Hilton,
meet your future.
-<i> We are serving Carnaval</i>
<i>pregnancy realness.</i>
<i>We're so happy to be pregnant,</i>
<i>and we're glowing</i>
<i>with anticipation.</i>
- There's a couple
of baby boomers.
- It's a very long child.
- It is a tall one.
My cervix is softening
just watching.
- Is it?
Mwah.
Welcome, ladies.
First up, Chad Michaels
and Lady Samantha.
- How are you?
- Hi, judges.
- Let's take a look at Lady
Samantha's before pictures.
That's James.
And, baby, look at you now.
Did you tuck?
- A little bit, yes.
- Oh.
- How do you tuck
just a little bit?
- Yeah, just push things around.
- Like, just between
your cheek and gums?
- Yes, sir.
[laughter]
- Yes, ma'am. It's yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.
- I have to say, James,
Lady Samantha if you're nasty,
I think you're wearing
the highest heels
on the catwalk here,
which I think
should not go unrecognized.
Very impressive.
- Thank you. Thank you.
- James, I love that you
were almost, like,
put out with how hot you were.
[laughs]
I thought that was really great.
I'd like to adopt that quality.
- So, James,
would you schtup you?
- Oh, yeah.
[laughter]
- Next up, Sharon Needles
and Robin Mansions.
That's Mike.
And now look at you.
What's your favorite part
of the drag getup?
- He seemed to be very occupied
by my breast plate.
- Oh.
- Liked it.
- Is Mike wearing it now?
- No.
- I swallowed half of it.
[laughter]
- I'm getting, like,
an Al Pacino in drag thing,
and not in a good way.
[laughter]
- Robin Mansions' face
repels beauty.
And I love that.
Nothing makes
a woman feel prettier
than standing
next to this one over here.
- Well, that's why I hang out
with Michelle Visage.
[laughter]
All right, next up,
Phi Phi O'Hara and Gi Gi.
Wow, that's Chris.
Now you are Gi Gi.
You're gorgeous.
- Thank you.
- What was the hardest part
of the striptease?
- Being fully tucked
and walking in high heels.
- So you were fully tucked?
- I had the elephant all the way
back towards the waterhole.
- Oh, really?
- I liked seeing
the resemblance.
- You look like you share DNA.
You look fantastic.
Great job there.
- I have such a girl crush
on both of you.
- What was the most
difficult part
of working with your daddy mama?
- We really worked
well together.
He's like an inspiration
of what everybody should be.
He's an open-minded,
heterosexual male
that just values people
for who they are,
doesn't judge a book
by its cover.
My dad's not like that.
If I could have a dad like him,
my life would probably
be a lot easier,
and, you know,
I wish I had that bond,
so it's nice to have
a friend like this.
- It'll happen one day.
- Do you think your father
will watch this show?
- Probably not.
And that's okay.
[crying] I'm fine with that.
I just--I hope he values...
like, who I am.
If I can get anything from this,
I'm just--I'm happy he was here
to see that I'm a good person.
That feels so good.
Thank you.
- Thanks, kids.
- Thank you.
- Next up, Latrice Royale
and Sharelle Royale.
That's Leland.
Girl, you come a long way.
- Sharelle is a ho.
She can't even get enough
of herself in the mirror.
- Really?
- Trust.
Look at that.
Do you see this?
- Yes.
- That's gorgeousness.
Gorgeousness.
- The family resemblance,
though,
it ain't up in there.
- You don't see none?
- Well, I...[mumbling]
- I'm different.
- Okay.
- See? There it is.
Now what? See.
- I will follow suit and say
that I'm not seeing
the family resemblance.
It's sort of more of like
here's two friends
in a Tyler Perry movie.
[laughter]
- Next up, Lil' Kenya Michaels
and Lil' Mama Michaels.
That's Rick.
- Wow.
- And this
is Lil' Mama Michaels.
- Rick, I feel like you and I
could be related.
I feel like we look a little bit
alike if I straighten my hair.
And I'm digging it.
- I don't love the dresses
that I'm seeing here.
I think they could have used
a little more flash,
so I would have liked to see
a little more sparkle.
- Lil' Mama, was this
an unwanted pregnancy?
- Uh, yeah.
- 'Cause it was the most
somber, macabre,
fricking death walk
I've ever seen.
I was like, oh.
This poor baby.
- [laughs]
- I'm ready to have this baby.
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.
I have, like,
four underwears right now
and, like, two pantyhose.
Even these shoes,
they don't even fit me.
They're glued to my feet
right now.
- Literally glued to your feet?
- They're glued to my feet,
so I can't take it off--
[laughter]
- He can't even kick 'em off.
- Thank you, ladies.
I think we've heard enough.
Now while you untuck in the
Interior Illusions Lounge,
the judges and I
will deliberate.
All right, kids.
Just between us "goils"...
let's start with Chad Michaels
and Lady Samantha.
- I loved the striptease.
I loved the walk.
- The runway presentation
was very basic.
Nothing sexy about it at all.
Because Chad doesn't take risks,
it brings Chad down.
- Well, I was enamored with him.
I thought she did a remarkable
job with Lady Samantha.
- Sharon Needles
with Robin Mansions.
- I love Sharon Needles.
I love her energy,
I love her humor,
I love her look.
However, I really thought
Robin Mansions
was a dog of a lady on stage.
- I just feel like she
left her sister out to hang.
- Phi Phi O'Hara
and her sister Gi Gi.
- Phi Phi is
absolutely adorable.
- I-I heart Phi Phi O'Hara.
Love the shoes, love the bag,
love everything.
Love it.
- There was really
an uncanny resemblance.
- Yeah.
- Latrice Royale and Sharelle.
- Oh, the Royale sisters.
- [giggles]
- We're sisters,
but we look nothing alike.
I just felt like they had
a different baby daddy.
- I wasn't a huge fan
of the striptease.
For me, a little lackluster.
- Lil' Kenya Michaels
and Lil' Mama Michaels.
- I thought little Eva Longoria
was just adorable.
So much charisma,
and I can totally see why
you'd want to bring her back.
- Their pregnancy dresses with
the fur coming out of the top,
the sweater set,
and the marabou trim,
it was all a little bit wrong.
- Kenya Michaels
is a fierce queen.
It's unfortunate that she's
just off her game.
- Silence.
Now bring back my girls.
Welcome back, ladies.
I've made some decisions.
Chad Michaels...
You're safe.
- Thank you, Ru.
- Awesome.
- Phi Phi O'Hara,
you babied your daddy mama
and carried this challenge
to full term.
- Damn straight.
- Condragulations.
You are the winner
of this challenge.
[applause]
- Whoo! Yeah, girls!
Whoo! Yeah!
- You and your daddy mama
have each won a trip for two
to Las Vegas,
courtesy of ALandCHUCK.travel.
- Ha-ha-ha!
Vegas, Vegas, Vegas,
Vegas, Vegas, Vegas.
- Thank you. Mwah.
- And all of our daddy mamas
will receive a $1,000
gift certificate
from Moods of Norway.
Kenya Michaels,
your daddy mama presentation
gave us a case
of the baby blues.
I'm sorry, my dear, but you
are up for elimination.
- Ooh.
-<i> Oh, not again.</i>
I don't want to do Carmen.
I don't want to go home today.
- Sharon Needles...
- You got this.
- You gave your daddy mama
a face only a mother could love.
Latrice Royale,
your daddy mama looked like
a sister from another mister.
Sharon Needles...
you're safe.
- Yes! Yes!
Yes!
- Latrice Royale,
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
- That's all right, mama.
-<i> I didn't expect</i>
<i>to be in the bottom two,</i>
<i>but I'm gonna turn it out.</i>
It's do or die.
- Two queens stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last
chance to impress me...
And save yourself
from elimination.
The time has come for you
to lip-synch for your life.
Good luck, and don't fuck it up.
[applause]
[cheers]
- Ladies,
I have made my decision.
Latrice Royale...
Shantay, you stay.
- Thank you.
- Lil' Kenya Michaels,
it's hard to say good-bye
to a queen like you.
Till we meet again.
Now, sashay away.
[laughter]
- I feel sad because
all the girls have the dream
to win this competition,
and maybe it's not my time.
Don't stop dreaming
'cause all the dreams come true.
- Wow.
The fantastic four.
The future of drag
rests in your hands.
Now, remember,
if you can't love yourself,
how in the hell
you gonna love somebody else?
Can I get an amen up in here?
- all: Amen.
- All right.
Now let the music play.


<i> Previously on</i>
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race....</i>
music makes the people
come together.
 Hold on, hold on, hold on,
hold on, hold on.
 Milan kept talking over
other people.
 '80s, it's about...
[laughs]
 It's getting real damn old.
 Just put some white powder
on your face and look gothic.
That's all we need you to do.
Sharon, she has
one good character,
so she might as well
use it.
 Did you work well
with Phi Phi?
 She definitely didn't bring
a strong leadership role.
 Sharon Needles...
condragulations.
 Yes!
 You're the winner
of this challenge.
Dida Ritz, shante, you stay.
 Thank you.
 The Princess, sashay away.
<i>And tonight...</i>
Ladies, you are all
under arrest.
<i>The dolls do hard time.</i>
 Welcome to Tuckahoe Prison
for Ladies.
<i> And tempers flare.</i>
 Tired-ass showgirl.
 At least I am a showgirl,
bitch!
<i> With extra-special</i>
<i>guest judges Nicole Sullivan</i>
<i>and Will &amp; Grace co-creator</i>
<i>Max Mutchnick.</i>
[cheering]
<i>The winner of</i>
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i>
<i>will receive a lifetime supply</i>
<i>of Nyx Cosmetics,</i>
<i>a one-of-a-kind trip courtesy</i>
<i>of alandchuck.travel,</i>
<i>headline Logo's Drag Race tour,</i>
<i>featuring Absolut Vodka--</i>
<i>cocktails perfected--</i>
<i>and a cash prize of $100,000.</i>
And may the best woman win.
[tires squealing]
 Whee!
 Open space.
 Category is...
 Cheesecake!
 I'm sorry, but The Princess
is in another castle.
 "This is the beginning,
the only beginning."
 Dida, I think you should do
the honors,
since you beat her.
 You gave me everything
I needed, honey.
 I'm not gonna lie.
A lot of it came from anger
towards the judges.
I feel like the judges don't
really know me.
I just have to show them
what the entertainer in me
is like.
Next challenge,
I have a lot to prove.
 We have a three-way mirror,
and I just recommend
everybody do a turn
before you step out
on the runway,
because the lumps and bumps
and the bra strap.
 The thing is that I
usually don't pad.
 Somebody needs to teach
a course at the learning annex.
[laughter]
All right?
 Sharon Needles,
how does it feel
to have two wins under
your belt?
 I'm proud of myself.
I showed up here,
thinking I would probably be
the first girl home.
I was prepared to, like,
embarrass my entire drag family.
I can't believe how well
I'm doing here.
I'm getting kind of
used to winning.
Any time I've ever attempted
to run in a pageant,
I'm always last.
And for any one of those
"high class,"
you know, gown and crown
pageant queens
that ever gave me
a raised eyebrow,
who's laughing now?
Ha!
 I figured Sharon would win
this challenge
because I picked a character
for her
that she can excel in.
 Girl, shut up
before I smack you.
[siren]
<i> Ooh, girl!</i>
<i>You've got shemail.</i>
Friends, you stand
on the shoulder pads
of a long line
of designing women,
golden girls who have
traveled down the road
and back again.
So whether you're looking
for Mr. Big
or just working
for Mr. Jefferson,
America's next drag superstar
needs the will and grace
to do whatever it takes to be
absolutely fabulous.
Now, kiss my grits.
[giggles]
[laughter]
Hello, hello, hello.
 Hi.
 Ladies, you are all
under arrest.
 What are you talking about,
girl?
 For today's mini challenge,
you'll be posing
for a memorable mug shot.
[laughter]
Now, you'll be working
in pairs,
so pick your favorite partner
in crime.
 I looked down the line
and I see one person
just looking, and I'm like...
[sighs]
You're with me, I guess.
What did I do
that was unchristian
that I have Madame
as my default partner?
 Oh, and one little detail.
Instead of doing
your own makeup,
you'll be responsible for
painting your partner's face.
 Oh, God!
 Oh!
 This couldn't possibly get
any worse.
 Oh, and one more thing.
You'll be handcuffed
to each other.
 [gasps]
 What?
[laughter]
 I have been to prison.
I don't plan on going in
no more handcuffs.
 Oh!
 Oh, I like this now.
 Book 'em, boys.
 Not too tight, officer.
 Now, you perps will have
20 minutes
to prep for your close-ups
before the photographer
from Polite and Public arrive.
On your mark, get set, paint.
 Let's go.
 Ooh!
 Ooh.
 Being handcuffed
and having to paint each other,
it's hard.
 [laughs]
 This is sick.
 I know, I need to get
something out of my bag.
I have a great idea
for a mug shot.
Madame's just like,
"Okay, I have ideas too,"
and I'm like,
"Well, we'll use mine."
Put this blue paint
on your face.
Take it and, like,
splotch it on me.
 Okay.
 Willam and Madame,
they both look like
they swallowed the smurfs.
[laughter]
 Willam and Madame LaQueer,
our first pair
of lady criminals.
Wow.
 We robbed a bank.
 Oh, that's the blue stuff.
 It's a dye pack.
 Of course, the dye pack.
 One, two, three--
violate the penal code.
Book her on the cover of<i> Vogue.</i>
Madame LaQueer is busting out
all over.
Toss that salad, girl.
Honey, you got me
scared straight.
Chad Michaels, Sharon Needles.
 Uh-huh.
 Oh!
Oh, dear!
You might need a breathalyzer,
honey.
 It's not my first time
at the rodeo.
 Deliverance!
Serving time!
Attica!
Excuse my beauty.
I was framed!
May I call you
Missy Misdemeanor?
 Yes.
 Don't drop the soap!
Serving time!
Salvation!
Child, you are serving some
Raggedy Ann realness.
It must be 5:00 somewhere,
because you got the shadow,
girl.
 [coughs]
[laughs]
 Acquittal!
Bad boys!
 What you gonna do?
 That's right, honey.
 Busted!
All right, girl.
If the wig don't fit,
you can't acquit.
All right,
that's a wrap...
sheet.
The verdict is in.
One pair is guilty of being
sickening in the first degree.
The winners of today's
mini challenge are...
Willam and Madame LaQueer.
 [laughs]
 Whoo!
[applause and laughter]
 Condragulations, girls.
Hollywood is a tough town.
One day, you're a big star,
and the next day,
you can't get arrested.
Today, you get to be both.
For this week's main challenge,
you'll be starring in the new
TV sitcom,<i> Hot in Tuckahoe.</i>
 A sitcom challenge
is my day job.
Come on.
I was like, sitcoms?
Oh, check.
 It's about four best
squirrel friends
who keep getting arrested
and sent to jail.
 [laughs]
 This acting challenge is
really exciting for me
because I have
a degree in acting.
This is my moment.
 You'll be competing
in two groups.
Willam, Madame LaQueer,
since you won
the mini challenge,
you'll be team captains.
 Finally, I'm not gonna get
picked last.
 Now, to choose your cast,
you'll be drawing names
from this iron fist shoe box,
which normally holds shoes
designed by yours truly.
Madame LaQueer, you go first.
 Dida Ritz.
 Cheesecake, yeah.
 Jiggly.
 Sharon Needles.
 Latrice.
 Kenya Michaels.
 Phi Phi.
 Milan.
 Milan goes to Madame LaQueer,
which of course means
that Chad Michaels
goes to Willam's team.
Willam, Madame LaQueer,
you are in charge
of assigning the parts.
I'll leave you
to learn your lines.
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.
 All right, you'll be Karen,
I'll be Charlotte, uh,
you'll be Julia, and...
Kenya is performing Marge,
the guard
because it's just so funny
to see such a butch so small.
 Oh, my God,
Kenya's so fishy,
I don't even think she know how
to be butch.
 Okay, we gotta do
a quick read.
 Welcome to Tuckahoe Prison,
pretty ladies.
Says here you were arrested for
soliciting a "meenor."
 Minor.
 Minor, a minor.
 [clears throat]
 When you're in
a group challenge,
everyone's work reflects on you.
Go over this word with me
a couple times.
Tuckahoe.
 Tuckahoe, tuckahoe.
 Slower, tuck-a-hoe.
 Tuckahoe, okay.
 Soliciting.
 Soliciting a "meenor".
 A minor.
 Minor, minor, okay.
 Are you gonna let her
take over this?
Are you gonna let her direct?
 Girl, are you gonna keep
telling me
what I am going to do
with my group?
If she wants it her own way,
then she can win
a mini challenge
and then direct the group.
 I have to wear the tights
with this?
 Our main challenge today
is acting in a sitcom
called<i> Hot in Tuckahoe.</i>
He said, "Screw it."
I thought I just did!
 [laughs]
 For me, it's a day job.
I'm cool.
 Welcome to Tuckahoe
Prison for Ladies.
As soon as I saw that there was
a prison guard,
I knew that's
the role for me.
Well, hello, gorgeous.
I'll let you hide in my hedges
any day.
 I beg your pardon,
but I'm not into horticulture.
What the fuck Is
horticulture?
 It's the study of plants.
 Yeah.
 [laughs]
I don't know what that means.
That's an S.A.T. Word.
<i> I'm</i><span style="bodyStyle"> not into</i><i> horticulture.</i>
That's the words
you're punching.
"I'm," 'cause that's you.
 But I'm not into
horticulture.
<i> I'm</i><span style="bodyStyle"> not into</i><i> horticulture.</i>
What are the most important
words in that sentence?
 I beg your pardon?
 No, no, no, you did it great.
 Leh-leh-leh-lah.
 I've been on sitcoms,
and I know about comedy.
Take your note and move on.
I beg your pardon?
 Just copy that.
Copy exactly how she said it.
 Exactly how they said it.
 I beg your pardon?
 But I'm not
into horticulture.
 But I'm<i> not</i>
into horticulture.
 Maybe I'll give Rose, like,
a Audrey from
<i>Little Shop of Horrors</i><span style="bodyStyle"> voice.</i>
This challenge is comedic
and character-driven.
I'm just starting to think
every challenge
is my kind of challenge.
 I thought you said it was
a Justin Beaver--fuck.
 Oh, my God.
Hell no.
 The other group,
it's weird.
Sharon is talking like
she has something
stuck in her throat.
And it's like,
country bumpkin cartoon.
 It's a little tighter
than I expected.
 An oversized beaver
rubbing up against her kid?
I wonder why she got upset?
 Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Are we talking about beavers?
Uh...oh!
 Are you doing an accent?
 Yes, I've got
a British accent.
 It's a little distracting.
Like, I think it might be a
little distracting to the text,
but that's your choice.
 I'm an actor, and I know
how to portray a character,
and that's actually my strength.
I asked the young man
next to me for his napkin
to wipe my friend's
sticky beaver.
 Oh, my God.
That's gonna be stupid.
[laughs]
 Hello, hello, hello!
 Hi, how are you?
 I smell Emmy.
[laughter]
 Whoo, that's correct, mama.
 Hey, kids.
 Hi.
 Hello.
 Team Willam, you have a lot
of TV experience, don't you?
 Yeah, if you name a cop show
in the past ten years,
I've probably been on it.
 And what role
are you playing?
 Karen.
 Oh, is that the slutty one?
 She's man crazy.
[laughter]
 And why'd you choose that
for yourself?
 I'm very Samantha,
and I was on<i> Sex and the City</i>
with Samantha,
so that kind of works.
 Really?
 That's what you gotta do.
That's what you gotta do, honey.
 Latrice, you are playing...
 Large Marge.
 The prison guard.
Now, are you drawing this
from personal experience?
 The tables are turned, baby.
[laughter]
 And Jiggly,
what role are you playing?
 I get to play Charlotte.
 Is that the prissy one?
 The prissy one.
 Now, that--I would never
cast you as the prissy one.
 She said it.
I asked,
"Who do you identify with?"
 I mean, like,
I have my moments,
so, you know, there's things
that I'm just like, eww.
 Okay.
I want to hear how Jiggly
gets prissy.
 I beg your pardon?
But I'm not into horticulture.
 Jiggly, I think you could use
a little bit more work
of identifying
who your character is.
She's not really angry.
She's more prissy.
You got to commit to it;
you got to nail it.
 Okay?
 Okay.
 All right, kids,
get back to work.
I can't wait to see it.
It's very funny already.
 Thanks, Ru.
 All right, good.
Team Madame LaQueer.
 Hi, Ru.
 Madame, are you
a good director?
 I wrote and direct
a play myself twice.
 Oh, boy.
Milan, you're an actor.
How is Madame LaQueer
as a director?
 Um, I think she's a little
laid back.
She could be
a little bit more directorial
with her approach
but, uh, we seem to be doing
a great job.
 Okay, all right, all right.
Sharon Needles,
what role are you playing?
 Rose the idiot.
 Oh, my goodness.
And Madame LaQueer.
 Charlotte.
 Madame LaQueer prissy?
That's gonna be quite
a stretch for you, isn't it?
Wow.
Kenya, what role
are you playing?
 Marge.
 You're the butch
prison guard?
 [laughs]
Yeah.
 That's an interesting choice.
Who made that choice?
 I did.
 You made that choice.
 Yes.
I assigned the roles.
 Okay.
All right, all right.
I'm gonna let you kids
get back to it.
Remember that comedy
is precision.
Find the cohesive rhythm
together.
I'm sure you're gonna
work it out.
 Right.
 All right.
Gather 'round, ladykins.
Later, on the set of
your sitcom,
we'll be joined by our
extra special guest judge,
the Emmy-award-winning
co-creator of<i> Will &amp; Grace,</i>
Max Mutchnick.
 Oh!
 Cool.
[applause]
 Awesome.
 Max Mutchnick,
he's a star-maker.
 Break a leg and...
don't fuck It up.
All right, see you later.
 Bye, Ru.
 Bye, Ru.
 I couldn't be more thrilled
that Max Mutchnick is here,
because I've auditioned
for him before,
and I haven't gotten the job,
so I'd like a second chance.
 Jail scene, take one.
 Action.
 Ladies, no one needs to
go to jail for liking nuts.
Why, I have a huge sack.
 Oh, me first, gimme.
 Ooh, I like 'em honey-coated.
 Oh, I like mine raw.
 Wait a second,
are we still talking
about peanuts?
 Cut.
Jiggly, wait a second.
 Wait a second.
Are we still talking
about peanuts?
 Wait a second, period.
Are we still talking
about peanuts?
There's a period there.
 Wait a second.
Are we still talking
about peanuts?
Eww!
 You know, it--yeah.
Let's just keep going.
Action.
 Rose, what in the world are
you doing in that crazy get-up?
When the security guards
were chasing me,
the only thing I could find
to hide in
was this Mr. Happy uniform.
 Well, that's you in
a nutshell, Rose.
 [laughs]
 And cut.
 Chad, you're a pro.
You've obviously been doing it
for 3,000 years.
 [laughs]
 It's really working for me,
okay?
 Thank you.
 Ooh, me first, gimme.
 William.
 Willam.
 Willam, thank you.
 It's spelled right
on my headshot.
It's in there, so it's just
on the way out.
 So, "William," it's just,
make sure you get all the words
in there and--
 Why don't you correct Ru
when he says "William"?
 He's got a $100,000 check.
 [laughs]
 Oh, that's right, okay.
You make a good point.
 Yes.
 Ooh, I like 'em honey-coated.
 Oh, I like mine raw.
 Get those nuts
away from my face.
 Latrice, have a good time.
 Okay.
 "Get those nuts away
from my face,"
and then give--
look at the camera.
There you go.
 [laughs]
 I mean, you give us--
I mean, honey,
you could do that
for a half an hour,
and they would laugh.
 Well, I'm gonna let you have
it now.
Okay.
 There you go.
[laughter]
Action.
 Get those nuts
away from my face.
 [laughs]
 I was really tapping into
some serious acting skills there
because Marge
doesn't like nuts...
but Latrice does.
[laughs]
 That's a series.
Latrice in<i> Get Those Nuts Away</i>
<i>From My Face,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> this fall.</i>
 [laughs]
 Our main challenge today
is to act in a sitcom
called<i> Hot in Tuckahoe.</i>
 Action.
 Of all the stupid things.
Rose, why did you show up
at the Justin Bieber concert
in this ridiculous costume?
 Justin bie--oh.
I thought you said we were going
to a just--
Fuck.
 You can't do that on TV.
 No, I know.
I'm really good with dialogue.
It's just a real tongue-twister.
 All right, so you want to
just pick it up from--
 Okay, we'll pick it up again,
and we'll have no problems
this time.
 Rose, why did you show up
at a Justin Bieber concert
in this ridiculous costume?
 Oh, I thought you said
we were going to a dress
in beaver cos--gone--
God, that's a fucking hard line.
 No F words.
And can we just make sure
that when you do that line--
 Well, it's a hard line.
I'm saying "dressed in beaver."
 Sharon keeps talking back.
 It's kind of
a hard thing to hear.
 I was like, girl, you need to
calm yourself down real quick.
 Please don't make me go
through that line again.
 Action.
 When was the last time
you washed this thing?
I mean, I nearly gagged
at the stench.
 Mmm, I kind of like
the smell.
Remind me
of high school gym class.
 Cut.
You were doing a one-woman
show out there.
You just seemed like
a crazy person
that's talking to yourself.
 Okay, okay.
 I nearly gagged on that--
on that stench.
 Ooh, I kind of
like the smell.
 Cut.
Kenya, you like
the smell of the beaver,
so don't hold your nose.
You love the beaver.
 I wonder why
she got so upset?
 It was just
a big old country boy.
I mean, that young man
looked pretty mature enough
to handle a beaver on his own.
 Milan, it's "mama's boy,"
not "country boy."
 I wonder why
she got so upset?
 He was just
a big old country boy.
 Cut.
 Sorry.
I mean, that young man looked
pretty mature enough
to handle a beaver
on his own.
 Um, Milan, Milan,
you're kind of
playing to stuff out here.
Be in the scene
with these people.
Look at the person
that you're talking to.
 It is extremely intimidating
to have the creator
of<i> Will &amp; Grace</i><span style="bodyStyle"> critique you.</i>
I thought this evening
was kind of thrilling.
Me and this oversized beaver.
 Milan's not exciting enough.
I didn't want to see
more of her.
I didn't really care.
 Action.
 And then his mother told me
to get my tail out of his face,
and then she really
let me have it.
 Gee, a sloppy, oversized
beaver rubbing against her kid.
I wonder why she got so upset?
 Cut, print, Emmy.
You know how to do a sitcom.
It's what you dream of,
when you're writing
this kind of stuff,
that you come across an actress
who just takes the stuff,
takes it to a better place,
and it's really wonderful
to watch.
 Thank you.
I feel, like, tears almost
coming
'cause I'm doing exactly
what I prayed for,
just to redeem myself.
 Action.
 That was so mortifying.
I "actudentially" spilled a--
ah-la-la-la.
I "actudentially" spilled
a virgin Mary on Rose,
so I asked the, uh, oh!
 Cut.
It's a bloody mary,
not a virgin mary.
 Okay.
 And I asked this young man
next to me for a--
Oh.
I'm gonna go again, sorry.
 LaQueer,
it's really important
that you listen to the director,
okay?
When you make a mistake,
and you're in front of
a live audience,
you got to keep going.
You keep stopping as if
you're allowed to stop.
There is no stopping.
 So I asked the young man next
to me for a napkin
so I can wipe my friend's
hairy beav--
 Ooh.
Ouch.
 Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
We are talking about beavers
or--ew!
 Can you do the "ew"
as Lucille Ball, though?
Ewwwwww!
Do it like that.
 Ewwwwww!
 Ewwwwwwww!
 Ewwwww!
 Ewwwwwww!
 Ewwwww!
 Ewwwwwwww!
 Ewwwwww!
 That is a wrap.
Nice work, ladies.
Tomorrow, you'll sitcoms will
premiered on the main stage,
where we will be joined by
one of my favorite funny ladies.
<i>Mad TV</i><span style="bodyStyle"> alum Nicole Sullivan.</i>
 Oh, I love her.
[applause]
 Oh, my God, I'm so happy
Nicole Sullivan's
gonna be a judge.
I can't wait.
All right, ladies.
We will see you tomorrow.
All right, here we go.
all: Bye.
[alarm beeps]
 "Mornking."
 All right.
 All right, time to work.
 Hello, boo-boo.
 So were you guys
sweating it up
in that jail cell yesterday?
Any flashbacks in there?
 I tell you this,
it was nice to be
on the other side of it
for a change,
you know what I mean?
Being in prison gave me
that opportunity
to, like, think about
what my dreams were.
And you know what?
Your choices are to accept it
and move on,
or to beat yourself
up over it.
Everybody makes mistakes,
but, bitch, you better look
sickening when you get up.
Sickening,
and make them eat it.
 Latrice,
can you take us to church?
[laughter]
 We all need a blessing at
this point.
Lord knows I do.
[laughter]
 All right, this is gonna be
good enough.
It's not a pageant.
 It's a pageant for my life.
Every day I'm up for it,
I think "pageant."
 What I said about Phi Phi
on the runway last week
makes me feel bad.
 Did you work well with
Phi Phi?
 She definitely didn't bring
a strong leadership role.
Basically what she said is,
"You're spooky,
dress like a monster."
 Come talk to me for a minute.
 What's up?
 Well, I don't know if
any of the other girls
have said anything about it,
but I'd rather have you hear
it from me now
before it turns into
much bigger than it was,
but in the last runway, um,
I was pretty sure I was
in the bottom two.
 Uh-huh.
 So I brought you up,
and I just wanted to
let you know.
 What do you mean,
brought me up?
Brought me up, how?
 Well, basically,
what I said was,
I felt that you kind of
pushed me into, you know,
just doing my spooky look
and that it was irresponsible,
and I thought
it was kind of sloppy, just to--
 Because I told you to do
something that you're good at?
 Well, I wanted RuPaul to know
that if she wanted to say
that I just kept turning out
the same look,
it was because you just wanted
us to be what we always are.
 You're an adult.
You could have came up to me
and said, "You know what?
I don't want to do this."
 I was being realistic.
 Realistic is bullshit,
because I picked out a character
for you
to sit there and do,
and you did it great.
You obviously won
the goddamn challenge.
 Because--because--
 Because of me.
Because I told you
to go in your closet
and dig out
that goddamn gothic look.
So congratulations,
you're welcome,
because I was the one
that sat there
and picked that out for you.
 Okay, well,
if you think that I won
because of you,
you--you are wrong.
 Then what--
what do you want to do?
 It's my talent
that gets me to win.
 Sharon, you know what?
You are not even
on the same level as me,
so get the fuck out of my face.
 That's right, because you--
 Get the fuck
out of my face.
Go back and do your only
one look that you got!
 Oh, I have one look?
Tired-ass showgirl.
Fuck You.
 Tired-ass showgirl?
At least I am a showgirl, bitch!
Go back to Party City
where you belong!
 I'm the fucking
future of drag.
You look fucking 20 years ago.
 Oh, girl, please.
 I tried to talk to you
like a sister
and I tried to talk to you
like a grownup.
 We aren't sisters, though,
so I don't ever want you
talking to me.
 Whoa, time to go.
 To sit there
and tarnish my reputation
just because she felt insecure
is bullshit.
Bitch, don't come for me.
 Future of drag.
Fucking tired-ass lame shit.
Future, the future.
[laughter]
[laughter]
[RuPaul's<i> Cover Girl]</i>
<i>And what?</i>
Welcome to the main stage of
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
Hey, it's that girl,
Michelle Visage.
 You spin me right round,
baby.
 [laughs]
Hey, Billy B., what's happening?
 You look sickening.
 Thank you, darling.
Max Mutchnick, how are you,
darling?
 Thrilled, and you get points
for just getting the name right.
 [laughs]
And Nicole Sullivan.
I'm so glad you're here.
Now, what would the Vancome
Lady say about my makeup?
 Looks like Little Orphan
Annie sat in the sun too long
and then got a boob job.
 [laughs]
Now, this week,
the queens were challenged
to play classic
sitcom character types,
and tonight,
they're all dolled up
for their television premiere.
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.
 Up first, Phi Phi O'Hara.
She's so vaginal in white.
 If I'm gonna go
to red carpet,
I want a gorgeous gown
that everybody's gonna be, like,
"Ooh, that's Phi Phi."
 I see her halo.
 And that dress has wings.
Latrice Royale.
I see the Beverly Hills, Billy.
 [laughs]
 I'm blinging;
I'm feeling beautiful.
This is the sheer elegant side
of Latrice.
 I think Latrice has a
Cable Ace Award up her sleeve.
 Or she's just happy
to see you.
 Uh-huh.
Dida Ritz.
Wow, she's on fire.
 I'm all about showing body
and leg.
I am working it.
 She's walking like
she has somewhere to go.
She's got a meeting
in the ladies room.
 Madame LaQueer as Folk.
 [laughs]
 I'm going for something
I would actually wear
to a event premiere.
 Lainie Kazan's sexy sister.
 Kirstie Alley
better watch out.
Willam, serving
a little Taylor Swift.
 I chose some
Vivienne Westwood
because the only thing that
matters on the red carpet is,
who are you wearing?
 I love it accidentally
fell off the shoulder.
Uh-oh, uh-oh.
 "Did my boob fall out?"
 Standards and practices
will hear about this.
Lil' Kenya Michaels.
 Work, Lil' Kenya Braxton.
 Yes.
 I feel amazing.
I'm a model.
This is my moment.
 A pineapple smoothie.
 Delicious.
Chad Michaels.
 Ooh!
 Very Florence
and the Machine.
 The dog days are over.
 I'm wearing a tribute
to the Tudors,
the Renaissance,
and I just felt really gorgeous.
 Take it all in, darling.
Up next, Jiggly Caliente.
 This is Brooklyn prom,
bitches.
 The girls that are edgy,
young Hollywood,
they don't wear
evening gowns all the time.
This gal looked pretty.
 It's always jiggly
in Philadelphia.
 [laughs]
 London, Paris, Milan.
All righty, man.
She's playing her gold card.
 It feels like I've been
poured in gold,
and if there was
a female version of the Oscar,
it would be me.
 She's just a bond girl.
 Octopussy.
 Sharon Needles.
 I kind of wanted to ham it up
and dress like an old lady.
 And she's so generous
with her fans,
signing autographs.
 I think Carol Burnett
found her diva.
[laughter]
 I'm so glad we had
this time together.
Welcome back, bosom buddies.
Let's tune in to
an all- new episode
of<i> Hot in Tuckahoe,</i>
the one with the beaver,
starring team Madame LaQueer.
 Of all the stupid things.
Rose, why did you show up
at the Justin Bieber concert
in this
ridiculous costume?
 Justin bie--oh!
I thought you said we were going
to a "dress in beaver" concert.
[canned laughter]
 When was the last time you
washed this thing?
I mean, I nearly gagged
at the stench.
 Mmm, I kind of
like the smell.
It remind me of
high school gym class.
Welcome to Tuckahoe Prison.
Pretty lady, so I hear you
were arrested
for soliciting a minor.
 That was so mortifying.
I accidentally spilled
my Bloody Mary on Rose,
so I asked for a young man
for his napkin
for me to wipe
my friend's sticky beaver.
 Did somebody say "beaver"?
[canned cheering]
 Finally, a big, strong man
who could get us all off.
[canned oohs]
 Now, let's all
put our heads together
and get this thing licked.
[canned cheering]
 Well, it's not gonna
lick itself.
 And my beaver is dirty.
[canned laughter]
 Are we talking about beavers
or...
[horror movie music]
Ewwwwwwwww!
[canned applause]
 [laughs]
 I think we did
a pretty good job.
We delivered.
 Team Willam, it's time for
another episode of
<i>Hot in Tuckahoe.</i>
You know, the one with the nuts.
 Of all the dumb ideas, Rose,
what made you think that
we could break into a nut farm
in the middle of the night?
 Well, Julia,
I was having such a bad day,
and the only thing
I could think of
to make me feel better
was a big mouthful
of Mr. Happy's tasty nuts.
 Welcome to
Tuckahoe Prison for Ladies.
Says here you were caught hiding
in the hedges.
Mmm, well, hello, gorgeous.
I'd like to let you hide
in my hedges any day.
 I beg your pardon,
but I am not into horticulture.
[canned laughter]
 Hey, guard, you seem like
a gal that loves nuts.
 Back off, chickapee.
I'm allergic to nuts.
Tried 'em once,
almost gagged to death.
 Did someone say "nuts"?
[canned cheering]
 Finally, a big, strong man
who can get us all off.
 No one needs to go to jail
for liking nuts.
Why, I have a huge sack...
[canned oohs]
Right here.
 Oh, me first, gimme.
 Hey, get those nuts away
from my face.
[canned laughter]
[canned cheers and applause]
 Wait a second.
Are we still talking about
peanuts or...
Ew!
[canned laughter]
[canned cheers and applause]
[theme music]
[laughter]
 Ladies, the ratings are in,
and one team was, in a word,
dy-no-mite.
 [laughs]
 The winning team is...
[suspenseful music]
Team Willam.
 Ah!
[applause]
 Condragulations.
But one queen in particular
was serving must-see TV.
The winner of this week's
main challenge is...
[suspenseful music]
Latrice Royale.
 Oh!
[applause]
 Condragulations.
You will receive a cruise,
courtesy of alandchuck.travel.
 Thank you so much.
I'm finally in the game.
I can get a little bit
of recognition
for what I've been doing.
That makes me feel incredible.
 Team Willam,
you are all safe.
You may leave the stage.
 Let's go.
 Bye.
 Team Madame LaQueer,
you've got some 'splainin'
to do.
First up, little Kenya Michaels.
Now, Kenya, you were playing
Marge, the butch guard.
Was that your interpretation
of butch?
 I was trying to be a Butch.
I tried to look like a man,
but--
 [laughs]
 There was nothing butch
about you.
 Runway was great.
You looked beautiful.
 So pretty, easy-going,
and I "lurv" the dress.
 Thank you, Kenya.
Next up, Milan.
Now, you're a trained actor,
aren't you?
 Yes, ma'am.
 Tonight, you are like
a stunning black Emmy award.
As for your performance,
I think you got lost,
and I think you were acting
all by yourself.
 You needed to
take it further.
It's always better to be told
to take it down
than it is to pump it up.
 Thank you, Milan.
Madame LaQueer.
Now, tell me about watching
yourself in the sitcom.
 I think I lost my accent.
 What accent
were you going for?
Can you give me an example?
 Of course.
I was going for this accent
because I am an uptight
and prissy woman.
 Hmm.
 Ah.
 You were working on an accent
that I don't think
worked for you.
I think that you were stretching
maybe a little bit too far.
 Thank you.
Next up, Dida Ritz.
 I think you could be sexier
and prettier,
and I think it's the hair
that is the issue.
 If you're going bare legged,
lotion up, girl.
Lotion up.
 Let's get to
the acting yesterday.
You have "it."
There's a quality.
It just comes out of you.
That's something
that cannot be taught.
 All right, thank you, Dida.
 Thank you.
 Sharon Needles.
 Hello, RuPaul.
 Here's my concern.
The whole thing,
the whole package
is just a little too jarring.
 This isn't the first time
I've caused concern
for being too far
out of the box.
 This is a little bit of what
happened yesterday.
You had something to say
about everything
that I had to say.
I need to know that you're gonna
take the notes,
not that you're just going
to say to me,
"This is just who I am,
and take it or leave it."
That throws up a flag
for a guy like me.
 Ladies, thank you.
I think we've heard enough.
While you untuck in
the Interior Illusions lounge,
the judges and I
will deliberate.
You may leave the stage.
Now, just between us "goils,"
what do you think?
Lil' Kenya Michaels.
 I think she's so, so pretty,
but it's my least favorite thing
to watch as an actor,
when they're just
really consumed with
how they look
instead of how they're acting.
 Why were you looking at me
when you said that?
 [laughs]
 Anyway.
 I think she was miscast in
the entire challenge.
 Madame LaQueer was the leader
of that group.
 She made some piss-poor
casting choices.
 Let's move on down to Milan.
 Kelly Rowland
better watch out,
but so should the crazy lady
at Coldwater Park.
This is a person
that talks to the sky
and tells imaginary
friends to watch out,
'cause she's coming.
 I was sort of shocked to hear
that she was trained.
I would have expected someone
who'd been trained a lot
would have been
a lot more at ease.
 All right, moving on down
to the team leader,
Madame LaQueer.
Well, she decided to give
herself a European accent.
 I legitimately thought she
was Russian.
 [laughs]
 This actress was not paying
attention.
She seems like a sweet lady,
but not for show business.
 All right, moving on
to Dida Ritz.
 I really was impressed
with the raw skill.
Dida has that innate ability
to sound sitcom.
 This is America's
next drag superstar.
This is $100,000.
I should not be having
to tell a queen
her hair needs to be bigger
and her legs
need to have lotion.
 All right, let's move on
to Miss Sharon Needles.
 My limited, sort of,
exposure to her,
I thought she was
kind of quirky and cool.
 I don't like the name.
I don't like the look.
I don't want to see a sitcom
starring the little girl from
<i>The Ring.</i>
 [laughs]
All right, silence.
I've made my decision.
Bring back my girls.
Welcome back, ladies.
I've made some
serious decisions.
Dida Ritz, you're safe.
 [mouthing words]
 You may join the other girls.
Madame LaQueer, the judges
were mad about you,
but not in a good way.
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
 I don't know why
I am in the bottom two.
There are people that actually
deserve to be here
in this position before me.
 Sharon Needles...
[suspenseful music]
You're safe.
 Thank you.
 Is there anything
you'd like to say?
 I've spent my entire
adulthood creating a situation
where I didn't have to
answer to people
and, you know, I'll
really work on taking directions
in the future.
[sniffles]
 Sharon, you may join
the other girls.
Kenya Michaels...
You are safe.
Milan, I'm sorry, but you are
up for elimination.
 Being in the bottom two,
it's a terrifying rush.
 Two queens stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me
and save yourself
from elimination.
The time has come...
for you to lip-sync
for your life.
Good luck...
and don't fuck it up.
<i>[Trouble</i><span style="bodyStyle"> playing]</i>
 In lip-syncing for your life,
you have to try to
take the other person down.
 I am really trying to
deliver the goods
that a drag superstar
should deliver.
 The pointer sisters
are the girls
who just point during
their lip-sync,
and Madame is
just a pointing queen.
She's a pointer sister.
 I'm just exploding
in energy at that moment,
because I don't want to go home.
 Madame LaQueer
wasn't doing much,
and I'm like, girl, Milan
just danced circles around you
and Swiffered the floor
with his taint.
 I don't understand why people
take their wigs off.
It's a drag show, not wig wars.
[cheers and applause]
 Ladies, I have made
my decision.
[suspenseful music]
Milan...
Shante, you stay.
Milan, you may
join the other girls.
 Thank you.
[sniffling]
 Madame LaQueer, my queen,
hold your head high
and know that you represent
Puerto Rico
at its fiercest.
 Thank you so much
for this opportunity.
I wouldn't trade it
for anything in the world.
 Now, sashay away.
 This is history
in the making.
I'm proud to be part of it.
I made it.
I made my dream come true.
This is only the beginning.
 My prime time nine,
condragulations.
You are all kings of queens.
Now remember,
if you can't love yourself,
how in the hell you gonna
love somebody else?
Can I get an amen up in here?
 all: Amen.
 All right,
now let the music play.


-<i> Previously</i>
<i>on</i><span style="bodyStyle"> RuPaul's Drag Race...</i>
- Tired-ass showgirl.
- At least I am a showgirl,
bitch.
Go back to Party City
where you belong.
- I thought this evening
was kind of thrilling.
-<i> Milan's not exciting enough.</i>
I didn't really care.
- Get those nuts away
from my face!
- Cut, print, Emmy.
- Latrice Royale,
condragulations.
- Ah.
- The color green
reminds me of fungus.
-<i> Milan, shantay, you stay.</i>
Madame LaQueer, sashay away.
<i>And tonight...</i>
Cock-a-doodle-Ru!
[chicken clucks]
-<i> The queens lay an egg.</i>
<i>And you'll be seeing double.</i>
- [laughs]
- That is not what I want to see
in my drag queen.
-<i> With extra-special</i>
<i>guest judges</i>
<i>Ross Mathews</i>
<i>and Loretta Devine.</i>
<i>The winner</i>
<i>of</i><span style="bodyStyle"> RuPaul's Drag Race</i>
<i>will receive a lifetime supply</i>
<i>of NYX Cosmetics,</i>
<i>a one-of-a-kind trip courtesy</i>
<i>of ALandCHUCK.travel,</i>
<i>headline Logo's</i><span style="bodyStyle"> Drag Race</i><i> tour</i>
<i>featuring Absolut Vodka--</i>
<i>cocktails perfected--</i>
<i>and a cash prize of $100,000.</i>
And may the best woman win.
- I get Madame's hangers.
- Oh, jeez, I get the heads.
- Madame LaQueer is gone.
The room's starting to feel
a little bit empty.
<i>"Chad, Sharon, Milan, Dita</i>
<i>equal true friends."</i>
- Oh, my God.
Wait, we're not true friends.
<i>I don't care.</i>
<i>She was a mess.</i>
Sorry about it.
- What'd it feel like to be
in the bottom two?
- I felt my freakin' age.
Thank God I survived.
I don't want to be judged
because of it.
- Bye, Madame.
all: Bye.
- It's a new day.
- You swept it all up yesterday.
- Yes, you did.
- You swept it all up.
-<i> So now that I have this win</i>
<i>under my belt,</i>
<i>I feel like I'm finally</i>
<i>in the game.</i>
America's next drag superstar
will be a big bitch.
- Well, now Kenya is the only
Puerto Rican here.
- I really thought it was gonna
be me and you at the bottom.
- Yeah, maybe I go
to the bottom too,
but my runway goes good.
<i>I don't scare.</i>
Mama, it's not what you say.
It's what you do.
Rawr!
[alarm sounds]
- Yeah.
-<i> You've got shemail.</i>
Are you a high roller
or a Hollywood square?
Because I got a secret.
If you press your luck,
you could be queen for a day.
But if you continue to wipe out
the competition,
honey, you could be going home
with all the tic-tac-dough.
Survey says, the joker's wild.
[laughter]
[cheers and applause]
Hello, hello, hello.
[cheers and applause]
For today's mini challenge,
you'll be pitted
against each other
in a series of grueling
physical stunts
for the brand-new game show
we call<i> Beat the Cock.</i>
- Cock-a-doodle-doo.
- Now, we'll play three rounds
with three contestants each.
The winner of each round
will go beak-to-beak
in a "cocktacular" finale.
And the one<i> Beat the Cock</i>
champion
will win a phone call home.
-<i> Oh.</i>
- Tomorrow is my eighth
anniversary with my partner,
Adam, and that would mean
the world to me
to be able to call him
and tell him I love him.
- Now, this first round
is Cock-A-Doodle-Ru.
First up, Phi Phi O'Hara.
All right, now,
the object of this game
is to pin these chickens
on my face.
Whoever gets the rooster beak
closest to my mouth wins.
Ready. Set. Cock-a-doodle-Ru.
- Oh, shit, okay.
-<i> That's more of an earring.</i>
- Pfft!
- Next up, Sharon Needles.
Cock-a-doodle-Ru.
- [laughs]
-<i> Yes!</i>
[laughter]
Contact.
- I'm sorry.
-<i> Next up, Jiggly Caliente.</i>
- Oh.
- Damn, I got it in my hair.
-<i> That means Phi Phi O'Hara</i>
<i>is our winner.</i>
All right, round two, kids.
The object of the game
is to get a single feather
across the finish line.
You can only use your breath.
If the feather hits the ground,
you need to go back
and start all over again.
On your mark. Get set. Blow.
-<i> Go, Dida. Blow!</i>
-<i> Oh, oh, one down.</i>
Starting over again.
- What the fuck?
<i>It's really hard.</i>
-<i> Yes, Dida!</i>
[all cheering]
- [laughs]
-<i> Dida Ritz is our winner.</i>
Round three, Choke the Rooster.
[chicken clucks]
<i>Now, ladies, the object</i>
<i>of the game</i>
is to get as many rings
around that cock.
<i>On your mark. Get set.</i>
<i>Choke the rooster.</i>
<i>Aim for the head.</i>
-<i> Oh!</i>
- Wow, Milan.
- Milan is our winner.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Now, for the final
championship round,
<i>Phi Phi O'Hara, Dida Ritz,</i>
<i>Milan,</i>
you've got to lay an egg.
<i>Now, the object of the game</i>
<i>is to carry these raw eggs</i>
<i>through these wig heads and lay</i>
<i>them safely in your basket.</i>
And you need to carry these eggs
between me down there.
<i>On your mark. Get set.</i>
<i>Lay an egg.</i>
<i>Now, the first queen</i>
<i>to lay three eggs wins.</i>
<i>Tossed salad</i>
<i>and scrambled eggs.</i>
<i>Ooh.</i>
<i>- Damn!</i>
-<i> Egg drop soup, anyone?</i>
[all cheering]
-<i> I keep dropping my damn eggs.</i>
I'm not happy about this.
[laughter]
- Oh!
[all cheering]
-<i> Phi Phi has laid two eggs.</i>
- Oh!
-<i> Get it, Phi Phi.</i>
-<i> Phi Phi is one egg away.</i>
<i>Phi Phi has laid her third egg.</i>
<i>Our winner is Phi Phi.</i>
[chicken clucks]
You'll get your chance
to make a phone call home
<i>a little bit later.</i>
- Yeah.
- Ladies, for this week's
main challenge,
the password is...
<i>Snatch Game.</i>
[cheers and applause]
- Well...
[all cheering]
- Now, this is your chance
to show off
your best celebrity
impersonation
and channel someone else's
charisma,
uniqueness, nerve, and talent
for a change.
-<i> One word, living legend...</i>
[imitating Cher]
Get into it, babe.
- I expect to be blinded
by stars.
Gentlemen,
start your impressions,
and may the best woman win.
- So what's everybody doing?
- I'm doing Wendy Williams.
- Diana Ross.
- How you doing?
- Yes.
- I'm doing Gaga.
- What about you, Kenya?
- Beyoncé.
- No, I'm--no.
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>what she's thinking.</i>
<i>I love Beyoncé,</i>
<i>but she's not funny.</i>
I'm scared for her.
- Well, may the best woman win.
- I really want you to have
my phone call.
- Are you sure you want
to do that?
Because I feel funny about it,
Phi Phi.
- Honestly, I really wanted
to win it for you.
- Honey, thank you so much.
- Yeah.
-<i> I'm really excited</i>
<i>that Phi Phi's gonna give me</i>
<i>her phone call.</i>
It was really unexpected,
and it was really sweet.
I owe you a big one, girl.
- No, you don't.
- Yeah, I do.
- You're my sister.
- See, you're not
a complete bitch.
[laughter]
- Who are you doing?
- Well, I'm doing, uh,
Michelle Visage.
[laughs]
Vintage Cache!
[laughs]
<i>I thought it would be memorable</i>
<i>poking fun at one</i>
<i>of the judges.</i>
<i>I think a lot of the girls</i>
<i>wouldn't go there.</i>
When in doubt, freak 'em out.
<i>Too much?</i>
Miss Michaels,
is it too much for her?
- Oh!
- [laughs]
-<i> Sharon is doing</i>
<i>Michelle Visage,</i>
which, I mean, that's not
a smart idea at all.
- Hilarious.
-<i> Now finally the judges</i>
<i>are gonna see</i>
<i>that she clearly has no talent.</i>
<i>Sharon should just pack up</i>
<i>and go home.</i>
Bye.
- Don't push it too far
where you're gonna insult them.
<i>Girl, she's gonna see this.</i>
- Let her.
- Who are you doing?
- I'm gonna do Diana Ross.
-<i> You are?</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
- Yeah.
<i>I mean, I'm used to doing,</i>
<i>like, Donna Summer</i>
and Kelly Rowland and--
you know, and those people
aren't like, "Ah!"
You know, so...
- Yeah, and we're left
with Miss Ross.
- Right.
[laughs]
<i>This challenge</i>
<i>is really exciting for me</i>
because my drag is sort of based
around characters
<i>and impersonations.</i>
My plan is to really have fun
with Diana today.
- Are you nervous this week that
you have to step up your game?
Like, the judges have their eye
on you?
- Maybe, but I choose Beyoncé
because it's more easy for me
doing that character
because I know it.
- You don't think, like, doing,
like, a Latin character
would work in your benefit?
- I can do Shakira,
but I don't like the character.
- I have the wig
if you want to do it.
- Yeah.
- I just hope that they get
funny from it.
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah, yeah.
-<i> Kenya'd be my sister</i>
<i>in how close we are.</i>
<i>I am worried.</i>
I wanted her to do something
with an accent
so that way,
it wouldn't be a handicap.
Beyoncé's not really funny,
you know.
She takes her career
really seriously.
<i>So I don't know how Kenya's</i>
<i>gonna make it happen.</i>
- Okay, we are what?
- Pretty sisters.
- Thank you.
- Well, Beyoncé and Gaga
should sit next to each other
on the...
- Yeah, I need to share it.
- Maybe I'll let you use
my telephone.
- Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
- I'm so excited.
- To think that, you know,
Cher's gonna see you doing this.
- I picked Cher because
it's what I'm most known for.
- You'll clock someone
doing Cher wrong.
They always do it too big.
- Show me one tape where Cher
went, "Oh!"
She never did that.
That's, like, a stupid thing
that people make up about Cher.
Cher's, like, much more subtle.
Cher's above it all,
you know what I mean?
-<i> I love Chad to death,</i>
<i>but the bitch</i>
likes to talk about Cher
way too much.
- Cher's got a great sense
of humor.
Cher doesn't give a shit.
Cher is a one-word diva.
- She's gonna drive me crazy.
- I know she's got a great
sense of humor.
- Well, don't you think
this is where
you're gonna run into a problem,
sweetie?
- With what?
- You're too afraid
to make fun of Cher.
- You know, the stakes for me
are very high.
<i>People are expecting me to</i>
<i>bring a certain level of skill</i>
<i>to the table, and I don't want</i>
<i>to screw it up.</i>
- Hello, hello, hello.
- Hi, Ru.
- Hello.
- Now, I've come to investigate
a case of identity theft.
- Oh, shit.
- Let's get to it.
Phi Phi O'Hara.
- Hi, Ru.
- I want to know who you're
doing in<i> Snatch Game.</i>
- Um, Gaga.
- Wow, that's a risky choice,
because you know in the past--
- It's been done.
- It's been done,
and the girl who did it
wasn't able to convey--
'cause what is her personality?
- Well, she's always about,
you know,
her fans and monsters
and paws up.
- I know, you're making it
sound very simple,
but I think it may be
a little more difficult
than what you're thinking.
- Well, I do Gaga a lot,
<i>and I've been hired</i>
<i>all over United States</i>
to impersonate her.
- All right.
- I've been recognized a lot
for my Lady Gaga.
<i>So I think Ru is gonna love it</i>
<i>and eat it up.</i>
- All right, get back to work.
- I surely will.
- All right.
Well, hello, Dida Ritz.
- How you doing?
- Oh, well, there you have it.
Do you know enough
about Wendy Williams?
- I do know some things
about her.
- She watches this show,
so you better be on point.
- I hope I am.
- Right, because she's got a few
trademark signature moves
that she does,
but then, inevitably, you have
to be quick on your toes.
- Yes.
- Have you ever heard her
radio show before the TV show?
- The one and only time I've
heard it is when she actually,
I guess, got into an argument
with Whitney.
- Well, let's--
give me a little sample.
I'll play Whitney.
- Okay.
- You play Wendy Williams.
- Okay.
- Uh, yeah, I heard you been
talking about me.
What's that all about?
- Well, first of all,
how are you doing?
- No, I'm doing fine, sister.
God is good.
God is good. God is good.
- God obviously isn't that good.
You've been getting
in a lot of trouble.
- Bobby Brown. Bobby Brown!
- Yeah, Bobby Brown's not gonna
help you right now, honey.
This is you.
How are you doing?
How you doing?
- I heard some Wendy in there.
- Yeah, so...
- That's very good.
- Thank you.
- Commit to the character.
I want to see it bam onstage,
okay?
- I'm gonna make sure I go
as far as possible.
- Good.
All right, get back to work.
- Thank you, Ru.
- Thanks.
Latrice Royale.
Who are you playing?
- Aretha Franklin, baby.
- Oh, of course.
Wow.
How are you gonna make her
come to life as a personality?
- Well, you know she's a diva.
I just kind of play off of
what she's done and--
- Yeah, you have to convey
Aretha Franklin
in, really, a few seconds.
- Right.
- And I'm not clear
on how you're gonna do that yet.
- Aretha is not really known
for catchphrases
and being funny and a comedian,
<i>but she's had</i>
<i>some funny moments.</i>
I'm pretty confident
that I can do this one.
<i>I got this.</i>
-<i> All right.</i>
Well, let's hope
that the risk pays off.
Good luck.
Get back to it.
- Thank you.
- All right.
Little Kenya Michaels.
-<i> Hola.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
- Who's your character?
- Beyoncé, the queen bee.
- I've heard of her.
- I'm trying to do
a sick Beyoncé
that have involuntary movements
that is crazy.
- I see.
<i>It's a risk</i>
<i>because of the accent,</i>
and, you know, if you were gonna
do a Latin star,
you would have a little bit
of an advantage.
- Beyoncé is a girl
that is very sexy girl.
- Yeah.
[both laugh]
I feel good in this.
- You're gonna do Beyoncé,
and you're taking a risk.
I hope it pays off for you.
- I'm gonna work it out.
- All right, get back to work.
-<i> Thank you.</i>
-<i> Thanks.</i>
Hey, Willam.
- Hi.
- Who do we have here?
- Jessica Simpson.
- How do you play
Jessica Simpson?
- Jessica doesn't understand
jokes much.
She says stupid stuff,
but she just does it
because she doesn't know better.
- I see.
Are you a fan of hers?
- Who?
- [laughs]
All right, Willam, I'm gonna let
you get back to Jessica Simpson.
I cannot wait.
- Thanks, she's sleeping.
- Oh, she's asleep.
Okay, well, let's let her sleep.
Get back to work.
- Bye. Thank you.
- Milan.
- Hello, Ru, how are you?
- Hi, honey.
Ooh, big hair.
Is it Chaka Khan?
- It's gonna be Diana Ross.
-<i> Oh, my goodness.</i>
You know, last week, you found
yourself in the bottom two
as an actor portraying
a character.
How will you convey
your character this week?
How will you sell Diana?
- Well, I think, um, I was
taking it too small, you know,
and I need to just--
it's better to tell someone
to pull you back,
and hopefully I won't go so far
that it's like a true
caricature.
- And you got to make her funny,
'cause<i> Snatch Game</i><span style="bodyStyle"> is about</i>
spontaneity and humor.
- Okay.
- All right, Milan, get to it.
- Thank you.
- All right.
<i>Chad Michaels.</i>
- Hey, RuPaul.
- Now, who on Earth could you
possibly be playing?
- My main lady, Cher.
- Cher.
- Yes, sir.
- Wow.
- Honestly, Ru,
everything in my life
has been because of Cher--
I mean, all the places
I've gotten to go,
the people I've gotten to meet,
the clothes on my back,
and I'm really looking forward
to doing her the justice
that she has done for my life.
I basically just owe her
everything.
So it's really important to me
not to offend her.
- [imitating Cher]
All right, I'll see you later.
-<i> All right, babe.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
- Oh, my God.
- Thanks, Ru.
- Sharon Needles.
- Hello, Ru.
-<i> Who are you portraying?</i>
- I'm not sure
if you know her at all,
but I'm doing, um,
Michelle Visage today.
- Oh, well, you know
you're supposed
to be portraying a woman.
- Oh, yes, I know.
This is gonna be
a little difficult for me,
but, uh...
- We say that with love,
of course.
- Yes, of course.
- What mannerisms of hers
are you gonna--
- I'm just gonna bring
a lot of harsh vocals
with a Jersey sense,
a lot of cackling.
[laughs]
This is where I completely
disagree with Santino.
- She's a fierce queen.
And it's quite a risk,
'cause she's gonna either
love it or read you for it.
- Right, right, right.
I'm feeling
a little bit nervous,
but I think I'll do her justice.
- All right, Sharon Needles,
get back to it.
- Thank you.
- All right, ladies, listen up.
At today's taping, you'll be
playing the<i> Snatch Game</i>
with our extra-special
guest judges,
late-night hot potato
Ross Mathews...
- Yay!
- Yes!
- And legendary actress
of stage and screen
and original dreamgirl
Miss Loretta Devine.
[cheering and gasping]
- Wow.
Loretta is the shit.
<i>She not only acts well.</i>
<i>She sings well.</i>
She's the real deal.
- So don't fuck it up.
Welcome to the new<i> Snatch Game.</i>
[cheers and applause]
Hello, I'm your host, RuPaul.
Now let's meet our contestants.
This intern has climbed his way
up the Hollywood ladder.
Please welcome funnyman
Ross Mathews.
<i>I'm so happy you're here.</i>
- Oh, please, I'm thrilled.
- Up next, please welcome
the multitalented--
Loretta Devine is here.
- Hi, Ru.
- Hey, Loretta.
You are a national treasure,
my dear.
- Oh, that's so sweet.
- And now let's give
a Hollywood hello
<i>to our star-studded panel.</i>
Now from the best show
on television,
welcome my squirrel friend--
Michelle Visage is here.
Hey.
- I might not be
the biggest star here,
but I got the biggest knockers,
okay?
[laughs]
- Up next, a great idol of mine,
the one and only Diana Ross.
- Yes, Ru, mwah, mwah.
I love you.
But call me "Miss Ross."
- Milan's makeup looks crazy.
I've never seen Diana Ross
look like she's cracked out.
- Next to her is singer,
actress, shoe designer,
entrepreneur Jessica Simpson.
- You won.
- Oh, she's got a piece
of her product hair there.
- It's synthetic.
You can use it to Swiffer
and everything.
-<i> Oh, okay.</i>
Very good pitch there.
Very good pitch.
- You're welcome.
-<i> You're welcome.</i>
- [laughs]
- Let's give some R-E-S-P-E-C-T
to the queen of soul,
Miss Aretha Franklin.
- So glad to be here, Ru.
- What is that you're eating
over there?
- Something that really
satisfies me.
- Oh, okay.
Did you bring enough for
everyone to share, Re-Re?
- Oh, no, baby, I don't share.
-<i> Oh, she don't share.</i>
<i>All right, all right.</i>
Straight from the<i> Jersey Shore,</i>
Snooki is here.
- Hi, Ru.
Ross, are you a juicehead?
- I could try it.
- Oh, my God, I want to smoosh.
- Okay!
- Next to her, the one and only,
the mother of all monsters,
Lady Gaga is here.
- Work it, girl!
Give a twirl!
Give a twirl, give a twirl,
give a twirl!
- Next to her,
the queen of all media,
<i>Wendy Williams is here.</i>
- How you doing?
- How you doing?
- How you doing?
It's nice to see you again.
- We've got 16-time
Grammy winner, hey, Beyoncé!
- Whoo!
- She's had a top ten hit
in every decade since the '60s.
<i>She's done it all.</i>
The original dark lady,
Cher is here.
- I've been there, done that.
I spread La Mer on my toast
in the morning.
All right, you know,
I'm Cher, bitch!
[laughter]
Ooh.
-<i> Yes, you are.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
- I don't care.
Ross, Loretta, I ask a series
of questions.
Our celebrities will fill in
the blanks.
<i>You come up with an answer</i>
<i>that you think</i>
<i>will match our celebrities.</i>
First question
is for Loretta Devine.
Ugly Edna is so ugly,
<i>when she goes</i>
<i>to the beauty parlor,</i>
they beat her face with blank.
- A picture of herself.
- Let's see if we can get
a match.
Michelle Visage.
- All right, Ru, I said
a baseball bat.
Remember, it was '87, we used to
take the J train into Manhattan,
and you used to carry
a baseball bat
before we would work
Susanne Bartsch's party.
We'd make a buffalo nickel
for it,
and it was all we used
for protection.
- No match, Michelle,
but a very good effort.
Thank you very much.
All right, Wendy Williams.
- How you doing?
- Ugly Edna, beat her
in the face with?
- I love Cher, and I'm gonna say
with Cher's plastic surgeon,
'cause look at Cher.
- Allegedly.
Allegedly.
- She looks good, I mean--
- Cher, I love the hair change.
- Thank you, I can't go five
minutes without switching a wig.
I love 'em. I love 'em.
- Sasha Fierce.
- I want to take a sleepy
right now.
- Oh, oh, oh, oh!
- How's she doing?
[laughter]
- I'm a survivor!
I'm a survivor!
- She's a survivor.
-<i> Kenya is taking it</i>
<i>to the extreme.</i>
- Oh, girl.
- So I need to step up my game.
It's just I don't want to be
flatlining.
-<i> Ross Mathews, you are next.</i>
The real housewives are so fake,
when they make whoopee,
their blanks don't move.
- Their Goldbergs don't move.
-<i> Very funny.</i>
All right, let's go to Snooki
from the<i> Jersey Shore.</i>
- Just like my friend JWOWW,
her tits don't move.
-<i> Her tits don't move.</i>
Beyoncé?
- Wake up.
-<i> Oh, is Beyoncé asleep?</i>
Beyoncé, were you sleeping?
- It's the medication.
-<i> That's no excuse.</i>
You should have seen
what me and Ru were on
at the Limelight.
<i>It's all behind us now.</i>
We were on uppers, downers,
and candy corn.
- [laughs]
All right, Cher, I see
you're wearing your Academy--
well, actually, you did not win
the Academy Award that year.
- I didn't, but I'm wearing
the shit out of this headpiece.
I paid a lot for it, so...
- Yes, you did. Yes, you did.
- Those girls are real sleazy.
Their scabies, crabs, and fleas
don't move.
- I'm afraid that's not
a Goldberg, Ross.
- No.
- Loretta Devine,
Fatty Patty is so fat,
when she gets on the scales,
it says blank.
- Ouch, ouch.
- Ouch!
Good answer!
What'd you say, Michelle?
We have a match?
- I said, "Hello,
Madame LaQueer."
- [laughs]
I told her not to wear green.
I hate it!
- Diana Ross, the boss.
- When she got on that scale...
- Yes.
- It said mahogany.
- Ooh.
- The men love me.
The women love me.
They all love me.
-<i> This was a real heavy</i>
<i>Diana Ross.</i>
This is like Diana Ross
about 4:30 in the morning
<i>after a couple packs</i>
<i>of cigarettes.</i>
-<i> Unfortunately that is not</i>
<i>a match.</i>
All right, Jessica Simpson.
Fatty Patty's so fat, when she
gets on the scale, it says...
- Oh!
- [laughs]
-<i> Oh.</i>
- These young people, see,
they don't have no respect.
-<i> No respect.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
- No respect!
- This next one is for Ross.
Dumb Dee Dee is so dumb,
she thinks the C word
is short for blank.
- She thinks the C word is
short for Kardashian with a C.
That's how dumb she is.
-<i> That's how dumb she is.</i>
- Stop!
- Let's go to Lady Gaga.
Lady Gaga, she thinks the C word
is short for?
- The crown.
The new diva crown.
Just so you know, the diva here,
not her, not her.
-<i> Uh-huh.</i>
- But now I have the diva crown
'cause I bought it from her.
- I just want to say
to Lady Gaga
that I am the only boss here.
- I don't even need to fight
my own battles
when I have my own monsters
to take care of it for me.
Rawr.
- All right, let's move on
to Miss Aretha Franklin.
- Snooki want smoosh, smoosh!
Snooki want smoosh,
smoosh!
Snooki want smoosh, smoosh!
- Oh, how's she doing? Oh!
- Uh-oh.
- Oh, my goodness.
- The level of
unprofessionalism, far too much.
- [imitates flatulence]
- What did you just do?
Did you just--
- You nasty bitch.
- One more time.
- This is disgraceful.
- All right, Beyoncé,
calm your ass down.
- This is worse than when I had
Omarosa on my show.
Get off me!
- Stars, listen up.
Shy Sheila is so shy.
- How shy is she?
- She's afraid to blank
in public.
- Oh.
- Yes, write it--write it down.
<i>Loretta Devine?</i>
- She's afraid to swallow.
- Swallow in public.
- Yes.
- 'Cause she's shy.
- Shy.
- I have a very shy gag reflex
myself.
[laughter]
Aretha Franklin,
you still down there?
- Mm-hmm.
- Uh-huh, your blood sugar's
going down?
- I don't got any more food.
-<i> You don't have any more food.</i>
- No more snacks.
I can't be bothered.
I am completely over the fuckery
that was going on
<i>in</i><span style="bodyStyle"> Snatch Game.</i>
-<i> Cher.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
- Yes, Ru?
- We're looking for swallow.
- Shy Sheila is so shy
that she's afraid to...
I don't give a rat's ass
because this game
is boring the shit out of me.
I don't know why they book me
on these chicken shit gigs.
[laughter]
I'm a fucking Oscar winner.
- Yes, you are.
Yes, you are.
Unfortunately, we've run
out of time.
<i>Now, on behalf of all</i>
<i>our stars,</i>
don't forget to spay and neuter
your neighbor's pets.
Thanks for joining us
on the<i> Snatch Game.</i>
See you next time.
Bye.
- There is such a thing
as going too far,
and it's unfortunate.
- I'ma gonna win!
I'm gonna win.
- You're not getting shit.
- Miss Cheesecake.
-<i> This morning, I'm still</i>
<i>feeling very emotional,</i>
very heavyhearted, angry,
disappointed.
I've never been so embarrassed.
The<i> Snatch Game</i><span style="bodyStyle"> was horrible.</i>
I felt like it was
a three-ring circus,
romper room bullshit going on.
- So what happened yesterday
at<i> Snatch Game,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> girls?</i>
- Yeah, what the hell
did happen?
It got a little crazy.
- I thought that<i> Snatch Game</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
was the most romper room fuckery
that I've ever experienced
in my life.
I could not believe
the shenanigans
that was going on
in the front row.
Completely unprofessional.
Completely childish.
And that is not what I came here
to do.
- I don't know where
my character went.
It started off right,
and I don't know what happened.
Did I make a mistake?
Yes.
- Well, it wasn't just you.
Even though Jiggly apologized,
I don't even think she was
the worst of the bunch.
- We know that nobody did
anything out of malice,
but everybody
wants the spotlight.
Some of the younger people,
I think,
should have been a little more
sportsmanlike about it.
- I just want to bitch slap her
because she doesn't know
what she's talking about.
I mean, at her age,
she shouldn't be such a bitch.
- Well, I think overall we
realize that today is a new day.
Bring your best; deliver what's
needed for this competition.
- Bring our breasts?
- Yeah, bring your breasts.
- Okay.
- [laughs]
- All right, you guys,
I'm gonna go call Adam.
[dialing, line rings]
Hi.
-<i> Hi.</i>
<i>Oh, baby.</i>
- Happy anniversary, baby.
I love you.
-<i> Happy anniversary.</i>
<i>I'm so proud of you.</i>
- Thank you.
It's just, I feel like I've been
gone forever.
Oh, my God, I miss you so much.
-<i> I miss you too, baby.</i>
- I'm gonna wear the giraffe
bodysuit that you made today.
-<i> Fun.</i>
-<i> Being able to talk to Adam,</i>
just knowing that he's still
there thinking about me
and rooting for me,
it was good for my soul.
- I like my Gaga, so that's
all that matters.
I guess because I saw
how some people
were going over-the-top...
- Yeah, yeah, I know.
- That I was nervous.
Like, okay, well,
am I not giving enough?
- Yeah, yeah, I know.
- I'm really concerned
about my position here
because I've been consistent
throughout
this entire competition so far.
- This is a problem, girl.
I don't want to go home.
- I don't want you to go home.
- But I'm gonna put that little
wig in my hair today
and go amazing.
- That's all we can do.
- [laughs]
[applause]
Welcome to the main stage
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
Hey, guys.
-<i> Hey, Ru.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
- Hey!
- Will the real Michelle Visage
please stand up?
- Here I am.
- No, you're not the real one.
- I swear!
- [laughs]
Shake the dice and steal
the rice, Santino is here.
- Why so blue, Ru?
- Ross Mathews,
how are you tonight?
- I'm fantastic.
I love you in a feather.
- Oh, this old thing.
Loretta Devine.
You look like a million bucks.
- Thank you, Ru.
You look fabulous.
-<i> Thank you.</i>
This week, we challenged
our queens
to give us their best
celebrity impersonations.
Tonight, they've come to the
main stage dressed to impress.
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.
First up, Jiggly Caliente.
Someone's getting lucky
at the prom.
-<i> I am classing it up</i>
<i>in my blue gown.</i>
<i>I feel and look amazing.</i>
-<i> Breakfast at Jiggly's.</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>
-<i> From</i><span style="bodyStyle"> Jersey Shore</i><i> </i>
<i>to Jersey housewife.</i>
<i>Chad Michaels.</i>
-<i> Rawr.</i>
-<i> How many giraffes had to die?</i>
<i>- Right?</i>
-<i> I'm giving you</i>
<i>some giraffe realness,</i>
<i>and I'm free to just stomp</i>
<i>the runway,</i>
<i>no strings attached.</i>
-<i> I love the peekaboos.</i>
-<i> The peekaboos are fabulous.</i>
-<i> Hello, they're saying hi.</i>
-<i> Milan.</i>
<i>Yes, I can, Janelle Monae.</i>
-<i> Or Bruno Mars on Red Bull.</i>
-<i> When I'm on the runway, I feel</i>
<i>like I'm on the tightrope.</i>
<i>And so I really wanted</i>
<i>to embody that essence,</i>
<i>and I wanted to have fun</i>
<i>with that.</i>
-<i> I hope Louis Farrakhan</i>
<i>don't see this.</i>
[laughter]
<i>Oh, Willam.</i>
-<i> Leather and lace.</i>
-<i> Damn, girl.</i>
-<i> My safe word is "yes, please."</i>
[laughter]
-<i> My outfit is very</i>
<i>hard-core '90s,</i>
<i>Grace Jones,</i>
<i>fetish blow-up doll.</i>
-<i> That's a Tarantino dream</i>
<i>right there.</i>
-<i> What are you gonna do,</i>
<i>arrest me for all this ass?</i>
<i>Phi Phi O'Hara.</i>
-<i> Is that a shoulder pad,</i>
<i>or is she just happy to see me?</i>
-<i> Darling, those are</i>
<i>$25,000 pyramids.</i>
-<i> This is my style.</i>
<i>This is my drag.</i>
<i>This is what I'm known for</i>
<i>and what I like to do.</i>
-<i> Assume the position,</i>
<i>Phi Phi O'Hara.</i>
<i>Dida Ritz, black Barbie doll.</i>
-<i> Somebody get a dollar.</i>
<i>She got stuck</i>
<i>in the claw machine.</i>
-<i> Uh-huh.</i>
-<i> I'm feeling like I am at</i>
<i>a Patricia Field show.</i>
<i>I'm giving you</i>
<i>my teddy bear skirt.</i>
-<i> No animals were harmed</i>
<i>in the making of Dida's skirt.</i>
-<i> No. Love a plushy.</i>
-<i> [laughs]</i>
-<i> Kenya Michaels.</i>
<i>Oh, the champion is here.</i>
-<i> Boricua!</i>
<i>- Puerto Rico!</i>
<i>- Oh!</i>
-<i> Boxing is one of the most</i>
<i>important sports</i>
<i>in Puerto Rico, and this</i>
<i>costume represents who I am.</i>
-<i> Float like a butterfly,</i>
<i>sting like a queen.</i>
<i>Sharon Needles.</i>
<i>After a little lunchtime</i>
<i>procedure.</i>
-<i> I'm obsessed with people who</i>
<i>have extreme plastic surgery,</i>
<i>and through the art of makeup,</i>
<i>I can temporarily be</i>
<i>that Janice Dickinson</i>
<i>or that Amanda Lepore.</i>
-<i> Yes, just a little bit more.</i>
- Oh!
-<i> Oh, oh, oh.</i>
<i>Now it's prefect.</i>
-<i> Just a little prick</i>
<i>in the mouth.</i>
[laughter]
<i>Oh, Latrice Royale.</i>
-<i> Oh, elegant.</i>
-<i> In royal blue,</i>
<i>and Royale is she ever.</i>
-<i> Yes, bitches.</i>
<i>This is what she's serving,</i>
<i>honey.</i>
<i>This royal blue dress</i>
<i>makes me feel</i>
<i>the most beautiful</i>
<i>that I've ever felt, ever.</i>
-<i> I own everything.</i>
-<i> Fabulous.</i>
-<i> And those are my girls.</i>
<i>Welcome, ladies.</i>
This week, you all snatched
our attention,
some for the better
and some for the worse.
When I call your name,
please step forward.
<i>Jiggly Caliente.</i>
<i>Dida Ritz.</i>
Latrice Royale.
You're safe.
You may leave the stage.
- [mouthing words]
- Now it's time
for the judges' critiques.
First up, Chad Michaels.
- Hi, Ru.
- The consistency
in your version of Cher
throughout the entire game
was just spot-on.
I was LOL'ing the whole time.
- I really responded
to this animal print.
Looks really futuristic,
looks really new.
- I especially love
the yellow hair.
I'm thinking about
getting me some.
[laughter]
- It's yours if you want it.
- Thank you, Chad.
Next up, Willam.
- Your Jessica Simpson--
so funny, so perfectly empty,
and you did it in a way
that I think
would make Jessica Simpson
laugh.
- If she could turn her TV on.
-<i> [laughs]</i>
- Willam, let me tell you
why I'm having a problem.
I feel like I don't
know you yet.
I love the way you get onstage.
I love the way
you hold your character.
Now I want to see
what else there is
besides this fierce-body bitch.
- I tend to think that emotions
are for ugly people.
- No!
No, we do have them,
but so can you.
- All right, next up,
Milan as Diana Ross.
- I had trouble with the makeup.
<i>She looked a little cross-eyed</i>
<i>at times.</i>
- You just didn't have
the Diana demeanor.
She floats,
you know what I mean?
She's like Febreze.
It's just better.
- You were like Chris Rock.
Like, how much it cost
for one rib?
-<i> This ensemble tonight,</i>
<i>I like that you had</i>
so much reverence
for Janelle Monae,
but I see you as a man.
<i>The suit, the pants, even,</i>
<i>the saddle shoes--</i>
it all reads as boy.
- Well, I mean,
this is what she wears,
and I really want to stay true
to Janelle's look.
- Bottom line, it's still
a drag queen competition,
and you're giving us drag king.
-<i> Up next, Phi Phi O'Hara.</i>
- The thing about Gaga--
and I'm a huge fan--
<i>is, you picked someone</i>
<i>who's all visual,</i>
and it kind of fizzled.
- I'm not a big fashion icon
or anything,
<i>but the shorts seem like it</i>
<i>should have been cut up higher.</i>
<i>Yeah, like that more.</i>
Those look like old
swimming trunks I used to wear.
[laughter]
- Sharon Needles, tell me about
your runway look tonight.
- You know, I have an obsession
with plastic surgery.
I love to look at people
that have it.
I mean, that's why Chad's, like,
<i>one of my new best friends,</i>
<i>you know?</i>
- Speaking of plastic surgery,
you chose to do Michelle Visage.
- What?
- Now, I'm very excited
to get to Michelle
to hear what she has to say.
- I'm not as old as you wanted
to make me, bitch.
- I have no idea.
- But with that said...
I thought it was brilliant.
Keep doing it.
- I just want to say, you know,
thank you all
and I love you all,
and I'm gonna tell you why.
[laughter]
- Kenya Michaels.
- Hi, Ru.
- I was very confused
with your Beyoncé.
<i>It was really frantic.</i>
The gyration movements
and the body snaps,
<i>that and the medication,</i>
it just didn't have anything
to do with Beyoncé.
- You're kind of a knockout
tonight
<i>in a little sequin</i>
<i>boxer outfit,</i>
but I worry you KO'd yourself
with your Beyoncé yesterday.
- Okay.
-<i> Thank you, Kenya.</i>
And thank you, ladies.
<i>While you enjoy</i>
<i>an Absolut cocktail</i>
in the Interior Illusions
Lounge,
<i>the judges and I</i>
<i>will deliberate.</i>
<i>You may leave the stage.</i>
All right, judges,
just between us "goils,"
<i>what do you think?</i>
Let's start with Chad Michaels.
- The planning, knowing
that she was gonna change wigs
and kind of give you
a new version of Cher
all equally funny.
- But I almost feel like
that was safe for Chad.
- It wasn't something safe
for Chad to do
because Chad really had
something to lose here.
You know, a lot of pressure
on Chad, and did he deliver?
Absolutely.
- Absolutely.
- I like what Sharon Needles
did more.
Now, yes, I know she played me,
but...
[laughter]
It's got nothing to do
with that.
She didn't think traditional.
<i>She definitely was not</i>
<i>a suck-up.</i>
She made me older and harsher...
and cheaper.
- Now that I've actually met
Michelle,
I think she could have had
more hair,
greater makeup,
I mean, bigger tits, even.
[laughter]
- Hey, let's talk about Willam.
-<i> Willam's quite an actress.</i>
Really committed to the
character of Jessica Simpson.
It was really funny.
- I always know
she's gonna throw back,
<i>so that's exciting to watch.</i>
But there's so much under there
that I don't even think Willam's
ready to let out.
I'm not gonna be able
to root for her
until she shows me that
a little bit.
- Right, that vulnerability.
Milan, I had a problem
with the suit.
<i>If the suit were a woman's</i>
<i>suit, it would be different.</i>
- I felt like I was watching
Sammy Davis Jr.
- Uh-oh.
-<i> Okay.</i>
- That is not what I want to see
in my drag queen.
- Oh, my goodness.
- Where did Kenya Michaels
go wrong?
- Well, first of all,
she made Beyoncé crazy.
- What was that Beyoncé?
- I know.
- It felt very uncomfortable.
- Maybe she just doesn't have
enough references
in her repertoire
to pull out something
that's believable and funny
and--
-<i> That's what drag is about.</i>
You have to have a knowledge
of pop culture.
All right, let's talk about
Phi Phi O'Hara.
She took some heat tonight
because of her runway look,
and also her Lady Gaga was
nothing to write home about.
- It just wasn't good.
- I like her, but she missed
the mark on all counts tonight.
- All right, silence.
Bring back my girls.
<i>Welcome back, ladies.</i>
I've made some decisions.
Chad Michaels...
- Yes, ma'am.
- This week,
you hit the jackpot, baby.
Condragulations, you are
the winner of this challenge.
[applause]
<i>You've won a custom gown</i>
<i>from Marco Marco.</i>
- Thank you all so much
for recognizing me.
It means the world to me.
- Thank you.
Willam, Sharon Needles,
you're safe.
- [sobs]
I've never had, like,
girlfriends.
I've never really been friends
with other drag queens.
I've always been an actor on TV.
I was on<i> Boston Public</i><span style="bodyStyle"> with you.</i>
And I'm getting to know these
girls, and they're awesome.
And it sucks to know
that one of them
is gonna have to go home
so I can win.
It's hard.
So yeah, that's it.
And I'm not acting.
Swear to God.
- All right, ladies,
the three of you
may join the other girls.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
- Kenya Michaels,
impersonating Beyoncé
is not your destiny, child.
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
- I feel bad
because I can't believe
that I go to the bottom two.
- Phi Phi O'Hara, your Lady Gaga
was on the edge of gory.
You're safe.
- [sobs]
-<i> It's very important</i>
<i>for you to understand</i>
<i>we're looking for the top.</i>
<i>There's $100,000 at stake here.</i>
<i>The world is watching.</i>
Bring your A game.
I'm telling you, Phi Phi,
you better come harder.
- I will.
- All right, you may join
the other girls.
Milan, my dear, I'm sorry,
but you are up for elimination.
- I was pissed.
<i>It's the second time.</i>
-<i> Two queens stand before me.</i>
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me
and save yourself
from elimination.
The time has come for you
to lip-sync for your life.
<i>Good luck,</i>
and don't fuck it up.
<i>[Vogue</i><span style="bodyStyle"> playing]</i>
-<i> Straight out the gate,</i>
<i>Milan's head is on the floor.</i>
<i>His legs are in the air.</i>
And I'm like, uh-oh,
this could be bad.
-<i> Kenya is so fierce,</i>
<i>and all I can think of</i>
<i>is, pay homage</i>
<i>to the people who lived</i>
<i>in the vogue world.</i>
-<i> I feel good.</i>
<i>It's about an attitude.</i>
If you have an attitude,
your booty move.
[laughter]
-<i> It is so intense</i>
<i>watching this</i>
<i>because they're both</i>
<i>very high-energy performers.</i>
It's tough to call.
I don't know who's going
to take this.
[cheers and applause]
- Ladies, I have made
my decision.
Milan...
shantay, you stay.
You may join the other girls.
Kenya Michaels, for a little
queen, you pack a big punch.
And now the world knows
you're a knockout.
Now...sashay away.
- Thank you.
- I love you.
-<i> I'm not sad, really.</i>
For me, the<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i>
is an amazing experience.
<i>All the Puerto Rican people,</i>
<i>be proud of my work.</i>
I'm a champion.
-<i> My crazy eights,</i>
<i>condragulations.</i>
<i>Remember, if you can't</i>
<i>love yourself,</i>
how in the hell are you gonna
love somebody else?
Can I get an amen in here?
all: Amen.
- All right,
now let the music play.


- Previously on
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race...</i>
I want you to meet some dilfs.
- Whoa!
- Or...
"Dads I'd like to frock."
- [chuckling]
You know who you look like
right now?
Rick James.
[laughter]
- How you doing?
- Pretty good, you?
- Good.
Don't talk to my dad.
That's what I like, 'cause that
way I can school these hoes.
- Phi Phi loves to come for me.
Come for me, baby.
[cabaret music]
- Condragulations.
You are the winner
of this challenge.
- Whoo! Yeah, girl!
- Latrice Royale...
shante, you stay.
- Thank you.
Lil' Kenya Michaels.
Sashay away.
[inaudible]
And tonight,
the queens get catty.
- And it's any bitch's game.
- You're on stage, lying,
is what you're doing.
- I'm not lying.
- Bullshit.
- With extra special
guest judges
Rose McGowan and Wynonna Judd.
The winner of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i>
will receive
a lifetime supply
of NYX cosmetics,
a one-of-a-kind trip,
courtesy of alandchuck.travel,
headline Logo's<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> tour,</i>
featuring Absolut vodka--
cocktails perfected--
and a cash prize of $100,000.
And may the best woman win!
- We are back in the workroom
this morning.
Kenya's gone again,
and we're sad, but we're kinda
glad that she didn't knock
any of the fantastic four
out of the running.
- [imitating Kenya]
"Girl, I say bye again."
[laughter]
- Read the whole thing in
that voice.
- "When I left this competition,
I feel loved.
"I love you and the winner is...
I don't know."
- Yes.
[laughter]
- I'm pretty sure she just
forgot to write my name.
- Well, we talk about
consistency,
and I consistently wear some
nonsense on that runway.
- It makes total sense to them.
- I think they're just holding
us to our own personal standard,
and they want to see
that you are...
- [sighs]
- Completely pushing yourself,
but that you are yourself.
- I want to go out as
Sharon Needles just one time
and see what happens.
- Yeah, and get read.
They're gonna be like, "You"--
- Ohh--
- Hey, it's all about risks.
- I come out as a freak too.
I used to do Club Kids.
But this is about being
America's next drag superstar.
And a superstar should have some
finished hems on their garments.
Oh, um, I won a trip to Vegas,
just in case y'all missed that
on the stage.
- Bitch, you gonna be
on vacation a lot, bitch.
- Where's my vacation?
All I wanted was a cruise.
- Shut up, stupid,
you're not getting one.
- It's your second time
in the bottom.
- Yeah, second time
in the bottom.
But you know what?
If you're not on the top at this
point, you're on the bottom.
But some of us
have not lip-synched--
- Girl, I can't help it
if I'm consistent.
- Oh, "I'm consistently
perfect."
- I brought my A game
to this competition.
If perfection is the worst thing
that people can call me,
then call it.
- Well, they don't want you
breaking a hip up there, girl.
[siren blares]
<i>- Ooh, girl!</i>
<i>You got shemail.</i>
<i>Hello, my pets.</i>
- Hi, baby.
<i>-</i><span style="bodyStyle"> If life's a ball,</i>
I say go fetch it, girl.
<i>Because it's a drag-eat-drag</i>
<i>world out there.</i>
<i>And sometimes,</i>
<i>a queen's best friend</i>
<i>can be a real bitch!</i>
<i>[barking, panting]</i>
[all laughing]
Hello, hello, hello!
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- For today's mini challenge,
we're gonna have a good
old-fashioned bitchfest!
- Ooh.
- And we're gonna do it
with puppets!
- Everyone loves puppets.
- Everyone loves puppets!
First, you pick a puppet
that represents
one of your competitors.
Second, you drag it up.
Third, you and the puppet
have a bitchfest.
First up, Sharon Needles.
Reach inside that black hole
and pick your puppet.
- [chuckling]
- Careful, there might be
teeth in there.
- [gasp]
Ms. Chad Michaels.
- The resemblance is uncanny.
Next up, Latrice Royale.
- Oh, of course!
I got Sharon Needles.
- Next up, Chad Michaels.
- Phi Phi O'Hara.
- You better get some spray tan.
- He needs glasses.
I don't think my puppet
really looks like me.
He's, like, albino,
and then he has black hair.
I don't have black hair,
and I have a mohawk.
That was not my puppet.
- So Chad has Phi Phi O'Hara.
- Wah, wah.
- "I'm old."
[laughter]
- Last but not least...
Phi Phi O'Hara.
- A little black baby.
[laughter]
- You have 20 minutes
to drag up your puppet.
On your mark, get set, go!
- Ah!
Gimme some black,
and some black,
and then gimme some more black
'cause that's Sharon
Needles, down!
[giggling]
- I'm gonna kick your ass, Chad.
- Why? What did I do?
- Bitch, I'm not that orange.
- What the hell?
Sharon's doll look like
a burn victim.
I guess it's plastic surgery
gone wrong.
- All right.
Time's up.
Let the bitchfest begin!
- Hi, Ms. Michaels.
"Oh, hi, Sharon."
You're just a vision
of perfection.
"But Michelle Visage
wants me to show
"some rough and tough looks
looks on the runway.
What does that bitch
want out of me?"
I think you look perfect,
especially your silicone work.
"Sweetie, getting silicone
removed from your face
"is about as hard as getting
a cigarette around here.
Can I get a fucking cigarette?"
[laughter]
- Hey, Sharon, good to see you.
"Fuck off."
No, really, girl,
what's going on?
"I don't strive for perfection.
I can just basically--
"you know, you see this dress?
I made this dress,
"and it's basically shit.
"And they just love it.
They love it. They eat it up.
"But you know what?
"I didn't get
my fucking cruise.
Where's my fucking cruise?"
Well, girl, just calm down
because you're kinda spooky.
"Well, thank you, Latrice.
Fuck off."
Okay, thanks.
- I certainly never tell anyone
to fuck off.
- Hi, Phi Phi,
how are you doing today?
"Um, I just wanna say
that I love everybody.
[giggling]"
You know, I'm always afraid
I'm gonna snag my costume
on your tooth, girl.
"[gasp] Oh, my God,
"I can't believe you went there,
Chad Michaels.
I'll get you later."
And what about your wig,
Phi Phi?
It's really pretty,
but haven't you worn that
like three times already?
- My snaggle tooth
is not that big,
and that puppet
looked nothing like me.
- Well, maybe you
could get the help
to help you out
next time, Phi Phi.
"I am not a racist.
I do not know why you guys
keep harping on that."
Yes, you're right, Phi Phi.
You're absolutely right.
I'm sure America's
just gonna love you.
[laughter]
- Oh, it's on, bitch.
Nah-ah.
- Chad got some shade
that lies deep within, honey.
- Hey, Latrice,
how are you doing?
Oh, is that your new single?
"Yeah, I'm the
Barry White of drag."
Oh, and that's, like,
a real beautiful necklace.
Where'd you get that from?
"Well, my friend
Lashauwn Beyon--"
[bracelet breaks, falls]
[all cackling]
- Oh, Lord Jesus.
- Oh, girl, this is awkward.
We should probably go.
- Yay!
[laughs]
- Ladies, you let it all
hang out.
The winner of today's
mini challenge is...
Chad Michaels.
- Phi Phi, we won, I love you.
- Condragulations.
You're the baddest bitch
in town.
- Thanks, Ru.
- All right, ladies,
in the great tradition
of<i> Paris Is Burning,</i>
for this week's main challenge,
we're throwing
our first-ever Bitch Ball.
- Oh.
- What?
- And you'll be doing it...
doggie style.
[dog barking]
First category,
daytime dog park realness.
[dog yaps]
- Oh.
- Second category is...
pooch in a purse party girl.
[dog yips, whines]
Third category is...
canine couture.
[dog barks]
A high-fashion look
inspired by a real-life dog.
[all gasp]
- Puppy!
- Babies!
How cute.
- Oh!
- Meet your fashion inspiration
and runway partners--
Filan, a Chinese crested.
Cali, a standard poodle.
Babyface, a Pomeranian.
And Hunter, a bloodhound.
Chad, since you won the mini
challenge,
you get to match each queen
with her dog.
- Hi, Hunter.
We're gonna do
opposites attract.
- I knew you were gonna
do that to me.
Bitch!
Ugh!
- Little baby!
- Oh, a little baby.
- So Babyface is with Latrice.
- You're beautiful,
but you're kinda edgy and crazy.
- Come here, Cali.
- Cali goes with
Sharon Needles.
- And I'm gonna take you,
you little beauty.
- Chad is partnered with Filan.
Ladies, you can use
your own drag,
plus furry fixin's
we have provided, and...
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i>
iron fist shoes.
[dog barks]
I think Phi Phi might be
in heat.
- Wow, Phi Phi.
- Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best bitch win!
- [barking]
- Whoa!
[laughing]
- [sigh] I'm already tired.
- See, this is a mess.
This is how you steal my heart
right here.
- We're all just bonding
with our dogs,
and I'm noticing that Phi Phi's
dog is a real handful.
- [sigh]
You're impossible.
Stay here for like five seconds.
Ah! Ooh!
- You know, Hunter seemed
to take a liking to Phi Phi.
- Ugh, you're drooling
on my artwork.
- Phi Phi's dog
is helping her draw.
- I definitely got
the worst dog.
I mean, who really wants
to fashion their clothes
after a bloodhound?
- Are you mad at me?
- No, Chad,
why would I be mad at you?
This is a competition.
- Well, you're the only one
that really looks at it that way
right now.
- Sharon, I don't need
your two cents.
- I didn't do it
to fuck you over.
- I didn't say you did, did I?
- I know, but you
just seem, like, mad.
- Chad--she's full of crap.
She knows that I'm one of
the strongest competitors here,
and so she's trying to get me
out of the game.
[dog growling]
- Don't be mad, girl.
- Girl, shut up.
- She just told me to shut up.
[dog barks]
- Get inspired.
Tell me what I should use.
You like this?
Do you like this fabric?
- Mwah!
[dog whining]
For today's challenge,
we need to create
three distinct looks
for the Bitch Ball--
dog park realness,
puppy in a purse,
and canine couture
inspired by a dog.
[dog yips]
Who's yappin'?
- Is that Willam
dropping names over there?
[dog yips]
- Shut your yapper.
You guys, I think Phi Phi
might be pissed off at me...
for giving her that bloodhound.
- Well, she's not happy
about it.
- If the shoe was on
the other foot,
she would have tried to get us
with her dog decisions.
- I didn't do it
to fuck anybody over,
but it's also I fucking won the
challenge, so it's up to me.
- True that.
- This is a competition.
I can't be preoccupied
with how Phi Phi's feeling.
- I know you're excited
I'm back.
- Sss!
[dogs whimpers, yips]
- I know he had a plan.
He can deny it as much
as he wants, but I mean,
in the end, I'm still
gonna win this challenge.
- [laughs]
- Oh, how did you get off?
Come here.
Oh.
Come on, let's go back.
- Oh, girl.
- Did she step on your
white fabric, girl?
- Yeah, she got paw prints
on everything.
- It's gonna be an adventure.
Get into it.
- Sharon, how do you feel
about this challenge,
like, are you glad you got
the standard poodle?
- To be honest, I did kind of
want Miss Michaels' dog,
just because there's so many
beautiful shades of...
- So pretty.
- Beige and gray and mauve.
I mean--
- That's why I got it.
- That dog's wearing
all my colors.
- This is gonna be so different
to see you in white, bitch.
- In white.
Well, I mean, you usually
don't see a dark lady
in the dog park during the day.
- White's not really my color.
Like I always say,
"Send me to hell.
I don't look good in white."
It definitely
is making me nervous.
And I'm not gonna be able to,
like, rely on my shocking makeup
because it's gonna have to work
with three separate looks.
This will be somewhat
of a challenge.
- Hello, hello, hello.
all: Hello.
- You look like you could use
a little pup talk.
- Ha.
- Ha ha.
- Hey, Latrice.
- Hey, Ru.
- Hey, Babyface.
Now, you've gotten heat in the
past from the judges--Santino--
- I have.
- About your styling
and your fashion sense.
- Yeah.
- Are you worried
about that at all?
- No, not really, because the
things that I have sewn myself,
people have raved about.
- Good, 'cause you are in
the final four!
- Oooohhh!
- But I gotta say...
there's no room for excuses
or mistakes at this point.
100,000 coins, darling.
- Yeah. And I need every bit
of all of that.
Because my life has been
such a roller coaster
and I've been so unstable
for so long, this is going to,
like, put me where
I'm supposed to be.
Being in prison,
I lost everything.
And it was hard.
But that 100 grand, baby...
that can buy some stuff.
- Remember, we wanna see
a storyline on the runway.
I'm gonna let you get
back to it.
Bye, Babyface.
[laughs]
That bitch is ignoring me.
- [laughs] Thank you, Ru.
- Well, hello, there.
- Hi.
- Are you making love to Filan?
- I've got puppy love.
- [laughing]
The judges in the past--
Michelle--
have said, you know,
that you're...
sometimes too polished.
What does that mean to you?
- I don't know what that means,
Ru, honestly.
I didn't come here
not to be perfect.
- I think she wants
more depth from you,
and this is the perfect
challenge for that.
What are you gonna do for your
daytime dog park realness?
- It's going to be
almost a little bit
<i>Little House On the Prairie.</i>
- Well, that's not particularly
a modern look.
- You'll--it's gonna work out
really well.
- We're asking you to be
fashion forward.
You've got a lot of work to do.
I'm gonna let you and Filan
get to it.
See you in a minute.
- Okay.
- Sharon Needles and Cali.
- Yeah, hi.
- Hi. So tell us about
your canine couture
inspired by Cali.
- I guess I'm kind of going
for a tight body suit
and then use the fur
as maybe like a big bolero.
- That's interesting.
- I think I am going to be
gold and tan tomorrow.
I'm running out of pale
foundation, so...
[both laughing]
- Are you transforming into
someone we don't know?
- Well, you know, um...
we'll have to see.
- That's interesting to hear.
We're down to the best
of the best.
You and Cali have
a lot of work cut out for you.
So I'll let you get
back to it, okay?
- No problem, thanks.
- Well, Phi Phi and Hunter.
How are you kids getting along?
- Well, I mean,
it was difficult at first,
but he's calmed down and he's
allowed me to work, so...
- [laughing]
Right.
So have you controlled
his saliva?
- Oh. Oh, no.
- Is that your inspiration?
- Absolutely.
A sticky, wet mess.
- Tell me about your
dog park realness.
- I really wanna take you,
like, to Paris...
- Ooh!
- And like poodle skirt
type of look, so...
[hunter whines]
- But the poodle skirts
are from the '50s,
and you've got a bloodhound.
- I'm gonna intertwine
both of those, like, styles
to make one look.
- Well, you know,
we really want the costumes
to speak for themselves.
We don't really want
a lot of explanation.
- Okay.
- Now, have you seen
<i>Paris Is Burning?</i>
- I've seen parts of it.
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.
- Oh, you've got you homework
to do, don't you, young lady?
You know what the ball scene
is all about, right?
- Oh, yeah.
I'm familiar with it.
- Have you ever walked a ball?
- No, but I've been asked
many times to do it.
- In what category?
- Face--
- But you didn't do it.
- I haven't done it yet, no.
- Ah.
- All right.
You get back to work.
- I have a lot to do.
- Bond with hunter.
- We have.
He's taking a nap.
[both laughing]
So...thank you, Ru.
- All right, ladies,
gather round.
Tomorrow on the main stage,
we'll be joined by our
extra-special guest judges.
She's no bitch, but she plays
one on TV and in the movies.
Rose McGowan will be here.
- [gasps]
- I love Rose!
- Yes!
- Really.
- And the platinum-selling
country superstar
who's always best in show...
Wynonna Judd will be here.
- Wow!
- I love the Judds.
I love Wynonna's music.
She's a kickass
rock and roll chick.
- In addition to modeling your
three doggy-style outfits,
there's just one more
little thing.
[dog yaps]
[dramatic chords]
You'll need to perform a
Broadway-style opening number.
- Bitch, I ain't got time
to do this.
We're trying to pull these
three looks together.
- Think<i> Cats,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> but,</i>
you know, with dogs.
Chad, since you won the mini
challenge, you're in charge.
- Shit! Is Ru serious?
Is he trying to kill me?
- Ladies,
the dog days aren't over.
In fact...
they're just beginning.
So don't fuck it up.
All right, bye.
[dog whimpers]
- All right, bitches.
It is time to rehearse the dance
routine for the Bitch Ball.
Let's do some blocking.
Kind of my idea's for Phi Phi
to start, like, maybe...
center?
- And maybe we should
kind of be in hidden pose
until we're supposed to animate.
- Or maybe you're just
sitting there like...
- Yeah, scratching fleas
or you know how theater,
how things are completely still?
- I kind of like the idea of
everyone being animated.
Maybe we could do--
- Well, you're in charge, so
just pick, and let's get to it.
- I would like you to do a pose.
- All righty, go.
- Or sideways.
As we get up on our first line,
move up with Phi Phi.
- So maybe we just crawl up
to one point for our line,
and then we...
- Okay, this is how
it really should go,
like a real show.
Because this makes no sense.
So when we're singing our lines,
all of us should get
into our four spots,
and we should land here,
just like we're in a musical.
Or else it's gonna
look like crap.
I'm kinda not having it,
because I really just want
to get all my stuff done,
and I really just
wanna make sure that this
rehearsal goes fast.
all: Whoo!
[dramatic chords]
- You're traveling this way,
and then you can just,
like, slide in--
- I was the one
that was chosen to lead,
so girlfriend really needs
to calm down
and let me
get a word in edgewise.
You can stay where you are,
but we'll come in front
and then you can, like,
bust through to the front.
- No, that's too long, Mary.
- We're talking about the first
part before we move.
- Why are we talking
about that
when we were just discussing
the second part?
- So that we can get
our transitions
all clear for everybody.
- But we're not transitioning
right there.
That's what we just practiced.
- It is so tense right now.
I can't take too much
more of this,
so let's clear it on up.
Here we go--five, six,
seven, eight, bitches.
- And to...
- Ah.
- Does everybody
feel good about this?
- Ow!
[dog whining]
- Don't eat it!
- So much to do.
- Yeah. The house down.
- This challenge is
a little bit intimidating
just by the sheer volume of
the work that we have to do.
I mean, that's three looks.
That's a lot of styling
and sewing and hair.
[dog whining]
- It's gonna be quite
interesting
on that runway tomorrow.
I'm just thinking about how much
I'm gonna whoop Chad's ass
in this challenge.
- You're hungry, honey.
- You're damn right, I'm hungry.
I don't understand what makes me
so much more hungry
than you guys, though.
- We feel you behind us
pushing us down the stairs.
I saw that movie, girl.
- Yeah, I'm a hungry bitch.
I mean, this is a competition.
There's so much at stake.
There's so many opportunities
form this.
They are just concerned because
they know that I'm here to win.
I love everybody.
- Famous last words.
- I do!
- That's what
the puppet head said.
- [laughing] Shut up.
[Latrice laughing]
- What do you think, Needles?
- Diva!
It's fantastic.
- What do you think?
- Gorgeous, darling.
Turn around.
Let me see it.
Work!
Work.
I still have to sew
a complete dress tonight.
- Ha.
- My original concept was to
create a bolero on a leotard.
Then I realized
I've never sewn a bolero.
Feel like I need some
methamphetamines
to get this project done.
- Just say no, Needles.
- One down.
What do you think
of this boot, Phi?
- [laughs]
Um, it's very much a poodle.
We've been working on our
outfits for a while,
and the only thing
that Sharon has accomplished
is he glued some fur on a boot.
- Phi Phi, can I steal you
for a minute?
Mama, come here for a minute.
- Me?
- Yeah.
- I'm exhausted!
[whispers]
I've never done a hem.
Do I just fold it?
- Yes.
- I know I have three looks
to put together
and on top of that,
sewing a new outfit.
It's just the straw
on the camel's back.
God damn it, my fabric got
caught in my machine.
- Sharon's in trouble.
I think that top four
is her stop.
This is where you get off,
Sharon Needles.
- [grunts] Uh!
[alarm buzzing]
[razor whirring]
- And back to work.
- Poomp!
- It's a dog-eat-dog world.
- Today, we're getting ready
for RuPaul's Bitch Ball.
We know that one of us
has got to go today,
so everybody's
a little bit up in arms,
and trying to pull it out
real quick.
- It's gonna be top three
after this.
- I know.
The stakes are really high
right now, you guys.
- [sighs]
I'm gonna lose my damn mind.
- Well, we don't want
to spin off the board.
I'm feeling not so confident.
I'm not sure, this time,
if it's gonna be enough
to keep me
out of the bottom two.
- Miss Michaels,
remember how psychic I was
when we first got here?
- Oh, my God!
- It was so creepy.
- You guys, this bitch
literally predicted
the whole sitcom
and mug shot challenge
before it happened.
- Told ya I was a witch.
- [laughs]
- Sharon.
- Uh-huh?
- Since you're miss clairvoyant,
who's the top three?
- I predict it will be Latrice,
and Miss Michaels...
and...
Phi Phi O'Hara.
- And you're saying this
based on...
- Off you know, my energies...
- Oh, whatever!
- That I am collecting deep
into my, uh, subconscious.
- Are you sure that's not
because you don't feel
so confident?
- I'm probably the most worried,
but do I want to be in
that top three?
Absolutely.
- [laughing]
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Ru.
- Welcome to the main stage
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
Michelle Visage, well,
you look well-groomed tonight.
- Bitch, please.
- [laughs]
Santino Rice, you dirty dog.
- [barks]
- [laughs]
- Rose McGowan,
you look beautiful.
- Thank you, darling.
I love your roses.
- Black roses.
- The best kind.
- And one of my doggone
favorite singers,
Wynonna Judd is here.
How you doin', mama?
- I like it rrrough.
- [laughs]
[imitates scooby-doo]
- [laughs]
- This week, our queens
unleashed their talents
and created three
doggy-inspired looks.
Are you ready to get this
Bitch Ball rolling?
- Ready.
- Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.
- Ooh...
- Ugh.
- Ew.
- Girl.
[laugher]
- Let the Bitch Ball begin.
Category is...
daytime dog park realness.
Latrice Royale.
Hey, girl.
Give a dog a bone.
- [laughs]
- I made a little, fun skirt,
a little slinky top,
and some cute pumps.
Bitch, honey, this is what I'd
wear out to the dog park.
- She's a real tail wagger.
- [laughs]
- Next up, Phi Phi O'Hara.
- Oh, she's brought
her own pooper scooper.
- Oh, my gosh.
- I'm loving my daytime
dog park realness look.
I'm Nicki Minaj meets Barbie.
- Well, poo-poo-pee-doo.
Phi Phi's the shit.
- [laughs]
- Up next, Sharon Needles.
Just another dog day afternoon.
- Is this another
Simpson sister?
- I'm serving true dog park
realness.
It's kind of inspired by
late '60s
Italian fashion photographs.
- She looks fetching.
That's right,
clean up after your dog.
Chad Michaels.
Uh-oh, she lost her doggie.
- I'm really loving my daytime
dog park realness.
It's light, it's flowy,
and I feel beautiful in it.
- I told you to keep your dog
on its leash.
Oh, you'll find it.
Category is: Pooch in a purse.
Party girl realness.
Latrice Royale.
Hey!
- Well...
- She is on the VIP list.
- Uh-huh.
- My party girl look is very
chic,
very "Let's go cha cha,
boo boo,
I'll meet you at the club."
- She's all up in the club.
The kennel club.
- [laughs]
- Phi Phi O'Hara.
- Oh!
Can I borrow that wig?
- That's her hair, Wynonna.
- Oh, I am so sorry.
- Oh, my goodness.
Look at those heels.
Her dogs must be barking.
- My "it" girl looks like
Rihanna
if Rihanna had a dog.
It's edgy.
- She carries her poochie
in her Gucci.
- Sharon Needles.
Oh...
- Rock and roll party girl.
- If Courtney and Lindsay
had a baby?
- Yes.
- What's she got
around her ankle?
Uh-oh.
- Oh, it's a scram bracelet.
- Yes, it is.
- I'm serving heroin chic,
hung-over, party girl realness.
Like the celebrities I see
in my tabloids.
- Uh-oh, uh-oh.
- [laughs]
- Eat a sandwich.
- [laughs]
Chad Michaels.
- Posh party girl.
- Ready for the paparazzi.
- I am serving structured
Kardashian realness.
I'm feeling very confident,
I'm feeling a little
bitchy in it.
- She has a big diamond
from her rich man.
- Yes.
- And she's got a big behind
right now, too.
- Mm-hmm.
- Very Kardashian.
Category is...
canine couture eleganza.
Latrice Royale,
and her dog Babyface.
- It's very<i> Mahogany.</i>
- Yes.
Look at that furry muff.
- [laughs]
- I'm giving them sleek,
sophisticated, simple, clean
silhouette,
and I'm feeling good,
and looking gorgeous.
- She's dressed to the canines.
Phi Phi O'Hara,
and her dog Hunter.
Ladyboy and the tramp.
- Oh, look at Hunter's bow tie.
- I'm a hound dog.
- I'm just trying to serve
the judges glamorous fish,
and they couldn't take
their eyes off me.
- Oh, yeah.
- You know what he smells.
- What does he smell?
- Pussy willows?
- Oh, of course.
- [laughs]
- Sharon Needles,
and her dog Cali.
- Cali caliente.
- That bitch is in heat.
Her poodle's on fire!
- It looks like
I'm walking three Calis.
I kept all the fur on the lower
half of me,
and her height
matched up perfectly
to my canine couture boots.
- Do the boots match the dog,
or does the dog match the boots?
- [laughs]
Chad Michaels,
and her dog London Paris Filan.
- [laughs]
- Every dog has
its De La Renta.
- My canine couture
is just a slight nod
to Cruella Deville
on vacation in Aspen.
- It's a little<i> 101 Dalmatians.</i>
- Cruella.
- Yes, very Cruella.
- Kinkyella.
See you on the slopes.
- Welcome, ladies.
Let's go straight to
the judges' critiques.
First up, Latrice Royale.
- I'm loving the whole
<i>Mahogany</i><span style="bodyStyle"> thing.</i>
- Thank you.
- I just think you've got a lot
of sass and a lot of class.
- And a lot of ass.
- Pow!
- [laughs]
- Eat it.
- Some men like a little meat
with their potatoes.
- [laughs]
- Out of all three looks,
I think the daytime was your
least successful.
Glitter navy skirt going
to the dog park--a little much.
- Your canine couture, simple.
I would've liked
a little bit more.
- Thank you, Latrice.
Next up, Phi Phi O'Hara.
- Because I worked with my
prissy-butt mom for ten years,
I'm always looking
for the head-to-toe.
I think makeup-wise, flawless.
Your sparkles are aplenty.
Your boots, oh, my gosh.
- The dogs production,
you stole the show.
You were fully into, like,
the cute little ditzy dog role.
Your Japanime, over-the-top
daytime realness
was not realness.
- I have no interest in real.
- [laughing]
- I find real people boring.
I'd be far happier to see you
at my dog park any day
than to see somebody in
sweatpants and tennis shoes.
- She would hate us
at the dog park, Wy.
- I don't go to the dog park.
I have people
that do that for me.
[laughter]
- Next up, Chad Michaels.
- The only thing I would say
is in the opening,
the lip sync was a bit off.
- Ooh, okay.
- Your canine couture really
shocked me when you came out.
It doesn't have to be so...
old lady.
- There's something about
that look that just...
is less diva-ish.
- Thank you, Chad.
Next up, Sharon Needles.
- Love this look tonight.
You look like you
came out of an editorial
out of Italian<i> Vogue.</i>
- [gasps] Ooh!
- I'm sure you
made those boots.
- 5-1/2 hours
and a hot glue gun.
- If somehow Liza Minnelli
in<i> Cabaret</i>
and Jean Harlow had a baby,
and threw it
in white puffy boots
with the perfect poodle,
it would be you.
That poodle could not have
worked the boots harder
with you.
- And it was good to see you
as a blonde-blonde,
not like an evil zombie blonde.
It was nice to see that
different side of you.
You continue to inspire.
- Ah!
- Thank you, Sharon.
Ladies, one final question.
Which of these bitches
does not deserve
to be in the top three?
Let's start with Sharon Needles.
[dramatic music]
- I'm going to say
Phi Phi O'Hara.
She has a very cutthroat
attitude.
To be America's
next drag superstar,
we need a sweetheart.
As drag queens, I think
we need to show as much heart
and family morals
amongst sisters--
- Bullshit.
What you said right now
is a complete lie.
I value family morals.
You're on stage lying,
is what you're doing.
- I'm not lying.
- But you are.
- Phi Phi O'Hara,
same question.
- I would definitely
have to say Sharon.
For him to stand on this stage
and tell...
that I don't value family
is bullshit.
If I'm, you know, cutthroat,
then so be it.
I'm a fierce competitor,
and I deserve to be here.
- Thank you, Phi Phi.
- Chad Michaels, same question.
- I would say Phi Phi.
She has...a lot maturing to do.
At times, she has acted her age,
and she's made no qualms about
wanting to win this contest,
hands down, whatever it is
that she needs to do.
- Latrice Royale.
- [exhales]
- I feel Sharon Needles.
She has gotten through this
competition being imperfect.
On the runway,
we strive for perfection.
If I was to come out here
with unfinished seams
and a ripped up this
and a ripped up that,
my ass would be handed to me.
- All right, ladies,
I think we've heard enough.
While you enjoy
an Absolut cocktail
in the Interior
Illusions Lounge,
the judges and I
will deliberate.
[engine starts]
All right,
just between us girls,
let's start with Latrice Royale.
- Party girl was her best.
That was cute-ish.
But it wasn't enough
compared to the other divas.
She was just too flat
for me tonight.
- When she picked Sharon Needles
and was critiquing her
for her unfinished hemlines,
and then I looked down
and Latrice has, like,
something that is clearly
an unfinished hemline,
it was little like
kettle, pot, black.
- Right.
Phi Phi O'Hara.
- I was counting Phi Phi out
for a few weeks in a row,
and she's really
done the Phoenix
and risen from the ashes.
- Yeah.
- I was very impressed
in all facets
of her performance tonight.
- What did you think of what
Sharon had to say about her...
ambition in the competition.
- Even if someone
is extremely ambitious,
I don't hold that as a fault.
- The blessing is she's,
you know, fierce.
The burden is she's fierce.
- I totally understand
that burden.
- [laughs]
Me too, Rose.
- Little miss attitude
down there.
- [laughs]
Chad Michaels.
- She's so elegant, and she
really has the "it" factor.
- She's got the beauty and this
classy look to her
that the clothes
did not live up to.
- Tonight was the first night
that I was like "meh" with Chad.
- Sharon Needles.
- She really turned it out.
She really gave us ball
day realness, like, down.
Boots!
Party girl chic
was the winner for me.
- She looked like an Olsen twin.
- [laughs]
The canine couture,
the boots that she hot-glued
together,
I want to eat that shit up.
- She owned it.
It's very, very hard
for me right now
to go between Phi Phi
and her for the night.
- Silence.
I've made my decision.
Now bring back my girls.
Welcome back, ladies.
Based on your performance
in the Bitch Ball,
I've made some decisions.
[dog whining]
Sharon Needles,
you are a lone wolf
who barks to the beat
of a different drummer.
And tonight, you are top dog.
Condragulations.
You are the winner
of this challenge.
[applause]
[dog barks]
You've won crystal flower
body jewelry
made by Marianna Harutunian.
- Thank you so much.
[dog barks]
Winning this challenge
means so much to me,
'cause I just never thought
I would be in the top three,
and it's awesome.
- Chad Michaels...
- Yes, Ru.
- Throughout this competition,
you have been
a leader of the pack.
But tonight, you didn't leave us
begging for more.
[dog whimpers]
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
- It's tough to hear
those infamous words,
but I'm ready to fight for my
place in this competition.
- [exhales]
- Phi Phi O'Hara, you started
out as the runt of this litter,
but tonight, you've proven that
you can teach a young dog
new tricks.
Phi Phi O'Hara...
you are safe.
[dog howls]
- Thank you.
- Latrice Royale...
I'm sorry, my dear, but you
are up for elimination.
[dog whimpering]
- Child, honey.
Let's shine on, boo boo.
Let's shine.
Let's shine on.
- Two queens stand before me.
Prior to tonight,
you were asked to prepare
a lip sync performance
of<i> No One Else On Earth</i>
by Wynonna.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me
and save yourself
from elimination.
The time has come
for you to lip sync
for your life.
Good luck
and don't fuck it up.
<i>[No One Else On Earth</i><span style="bodyStyle"> playing]</i>
- I've never done
a country song ever,
and my plan is to just attack it
Latrice Royale style.
- I don't want to go home,
not after coming this far,
so I'm gonna turn it out.
- Latrice always gives that
great soul energy.
Unfortunately, I just don't
think that synced up
with this song.
- [laughing]
- Oh...my...God.
[applause]
- Work, bitches!
- Ladies...
I've made my decision.
Chad Michaels...
shante, you stay.
You may join the other girls.
- Thank you, Ru.
Thank you, judges.
- Latrice Royale...my queen.
I bow to you.
And I have one thing to say:
Bitches better beware.
- You have changed my life
forever.
You have changed the world
of drag forever.
I love you and respect you
so much.
And thank you for seeing
something special in me.
Thank you.
- Thank you.
Now...
sashay away.
- [sobbing]
She is large, in charge,
chunky, yet funky,
the bold and beautiful,
I am Latrice Royale.
[dog barks, whines]
- Dream and dream big.
It doesn't matter
where you come from,
what color you are,
what shape you are.
Be the best you can be.
- My top three,
the best of the best.
And there's only one way
to go from here,
and that's up.
So remember,
if you can't love yourself,
how in the hell you gonna
love somebody else?
Can I an amen up in here.
all: Amen!
- All right,
now let the music play.


- Previously on<i> </i>
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race...</i>
the theme for this year's Pride
is hope floats.
[cheers and applause]
- Jiggly is a hot mess.
- Where the fuck are my
tits?
- Ahoy.
Orange Jigglius.
- Does her snake have one eye
or two?
- I'm giving you maritime
realness with the starship
Willam.
- Milan.
- Her body language is totally
"dude in a dress."
- Willam, condragulations.
You are the winner of this
challenge.
- Jiggly Caliente...
shantay, you stay.
Milan, sashay away.
And tonight...
get out your library cards,
girls.
The library is open.
- You're such a fat slut,
after sex you smoke hams.
[laughter]
- And the dolls go glossy.
- You have to spot me.
- With extra special guest
judges Regina King
and Pam Tillis.
The winner of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i>
will receive a lifetime supply
of NYX Cosmetics,
a one-of-a-kind trip courtesy of
alandchuck.travel,
headline Logo's Drag Race tour
featuring Absolut Vodka...
cocktails perfected...
and a cash prize of $100,000.
And may the best woman win.
[tires screeching]
- Cluck, cluck, ladies.
- Where's our hangers?
- Wha-wha!
- Milan's gone, and now it's
down to the lucky seven.
- "Colored girl, why yo base
look like chalk?"
- I loved Milan, you guys.
Milan was a class act.
How did it feel to lip sync
against your mama?
Were you scared?
- No, 'cause I know Milan is
good, but then I know I'm good
too.
- Well...
- Do you think you're gonna
win the show?
- At least--
- That was an awkwardly long
pause.
- Yeah.
- I was at the bottom two
twice, so the girls are just
kinda, like, assuming that
I ain't shit.
- You went from a baked potato
to a sweet potato.
- Sweet potatoes have
antioxidants.
- But they're better.
- It's a good fat,
as they say.
- Dumbass bitches, I'm gonna
fight till the end.
I just wanna see her do what I
did with our without shoes.
- You wanna see me do a split?
- Go ahead, jump into a split.
- I can't jump into a split.
- Thank you, then shut the
fuck up, bitch.
- Bye, Milan.
We'll see you in New York City.
She as really defensive,
though, a lot.
- It's hard to come here and,
like,
people tell you
that you're not good
at what you've been doing.
- Oh, trust me, I get it.
I think the trick with dealing
with the judging panel
is just get them to tell you
that they have no notes
and that you're perfect.
[laughs]
Yeah, I won.
I was stunned.
I'm like,
"This is the best review
I've ever gotten in my life.
- You had your moment,
and you done had your shine.
Now, can we let it go, girl?
Because, boo-boo,
it's a new week
and a new challenge.
And you're in one week,
and you can slip the next.
No tea, no shade.
- I was fucking stunned
that they said that.
- Well, they upped
the smoke machine last night,
so they couldn't see your beard
coming through.
[laughter]
[alarm sounds]
- Ooh, girl!
You got shemail.
Extra, extra!
Tweet all about it!
Like a rolling stone, today's
queen on the down low needs to
be a real hustler on time and
always in style.
So start spreading the news,
'cause you're gonna wake up in
a cyber city that never sleeps.
Hello, hello, hello.
[together]
Good morning.
- My legendary children.
In the great tradition of
<i>Paris is Burning...</i>
[deep voice] Get out your
library cards, girls.
- Ooh!
- Yes!
- Because reading is what?
all: Fundamental!
- Oh, God.
- Now for today's mini
challenge, you'll take turns
throwing shade.
Hashtag "thelibraryisopen."
21st-century reading, darlings.
All right, ladies, first up
Dida Ritz.
- I'm gonna try.
I don't know how to really read
that well, so...
does someone smell that?
- What? What is it?
- Oh, that's just
Sharon Needles.
- Oh!
- Jiggly Caliente, you should
feel honored.
The first contestant in
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> history</i>
with child.
- Oh!
- [laughs]
- Latrice Royale,
you're free now.
You don't have to rock the yard
sandals anymore.
[laughter]
- Jiggly Caliente.
Darling, what do you see?
- Bitches.
- Oh-oh.
- Dida, let me start with you,
boo.
- There's lotion in my purse.
You need to use them on your
elbows and your knees.
You look like you've been
driving through flour, baby.
- Oh!
Phi Phi O'Hara,
India called.
She wants her look back,
boo.
- [chuckles]
- Mama Chad, it's called
Forever 21, not Forever 41.
- [laughs]
- Willam, honey, your face
is made out of marble.
Shit don't move.
- Oh-oh.
Dida, you know,
I always think it's cute
to rock your mother's
two-piece sweater set
on the runway.
Oh-oh.
- Oh, jujubee, you know,
helium's for balloons,
not your stomach.
Oh, and, you know, Willam,
I know you're talented at,
you know, buying shoes,
but are you talented at,
you know, drag?
You know, uh, Sharon, I love how
you rock the party city.
- That's where I got your
Lady Gaga wig.
[laughter]
Phi Phi sucked.
- Dida Ritz, I don't know if
that is hot couture or hot
"coutorn," 'cause there's holes
in that shirt.
There are holes in the garment.
Ooh, Jiggly.
Jiggly, uh, 31--yeah,
there should be 32.
- Ooh.
Phi Phi, you are gorgeous.
You catch the camera's eye
from the right.
But from the left, you snag it.
- Ohh!
Crawlin' out the tar pits with
your relative the saber-tooth.
Visit it while you're in
Los Angeles.
- [laughs]
- Chad Michaels, you so old,
you still on
myspace.Com/chadmichaels.
- I was gonna take that down.
- Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the RuPaul ball.
Tonight in the category
of butch queen, Dida Ritz.
- Oh!
- Jiggly, I love you.
Come to mother dust.
Come here, come to me.
Come to me, I won't hurt you.
Here's my dentist's card.
Use it.
Willam Belli.
Willam Belli loves to live his
life and think that he's
Carrie Bradshaw.
But in the sequel, she'll be
playing Scary Bradshaw.
- Oh-oh.
- Latrice.
Latrice's feet are so big,
she will be starring
in the remake
of the beloved family favorite
<i>Flipper.</i>
[laughter]
- Jiggly Caliente, B.M.W.
Body Made Wrong.
[laughter]
Phi Phi O'Hara, although reading
is fundamental, darling, you
might learn how to spell first,
you illiterate fuck.
[laughter]
Willam, Miss Industry,
congratulations on your new role
as the big bad wolf by the hair
on your chinny, chin, chin.
- Yeah!
- Yes!
- Sharon Needles, two words...
sideshow freak.
[laughter]
- Dida Ritz, a lot of you girls
like to clock me for painting
my skin on the gray side, but
I was inspired by your knees.
- Oh!
- They're the same color
as Willam's chin.
- Oh-oh-oh!
- Phi Phi O'Hara, what brand
of makeup do you wear?
Sherman Williams?
- Uh-oh, uh-oh.
- That was a weak one.
Latrice Royale, you know,
a lot of us have done
great work in bars.
You've done your best
behind them.
[laughter]
Jiggly Caliente, you're such
a fat slut,
after sex you smoke hams.
[laughter]
- [deep voice] The library is
permanently shut down.
Ooh, no tea, no shade.
And the winner is...
Latrice Royale.
[cheering]
- Yes.
- Condragulations, darling.
- Thank you, Mama.
- My girls.
For this week's main challenge,
I need you to conquer the world
of publishing.
You'll be launching your very
own dragazine.
Oh, pit crew!
As editor-in-chief, you'll each
be assigned a different title.
And then it's up to you to
create a cover, choose the
articles, and really make it
your own.
Now, Latrice, since you won
the mini challenge, you get to
assign the dragazines.
- Oh.
- She's picking<i> </i>
<i>Battle of the Bulge,</i>
health and fitness.
Jiggly Caliente.
Wow.
-<i> Tastes Like Chicken.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
For food lovers.
Dida Ritz.
Uh-oh,<i> Sugar Walls.</i>
Now, this is home decor.
Willam, editor-in-chief.
<i>Kitty Cats.</i>
Meow! For cat lovers.
Meow!
<i>Kitty Cats!</i>
[laughter]
- I love pussy.
- Yes, who doesn't?
<i>Sashay Away.</i>
Travel.
Phi Phi O'Hara.
- Are you trying to say
something?
- Please do.
[laughter]
- And last but not least,
for fashion,<i> Eleganza</i><span style="bodyStyle"> goes to...</i>
Chad Michaels,
which leaves<i> What's the T?</i>
Celebrity gossip
for Latrice Royale.
All right, ladies, you are on
a tight deadline,
so get to work.
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.
- I think what makes this
challenge so hard is we've not
had to do anything like this.
It kinds separates the
intellectual people from
the not-so-intellectual people.
- Jiggly does go right for that
snack bin, honey.
It helps her think, I think.
Crunch, crunch.
"Oh, yeah, I got an idea."
Crunch, crunch.
Health and fitness.
Ha!
- Jiggly.
- [belches]
- Any complaints?
- What the fuck do I know
about working out?
- I know, right!
- Shit.
- See, I'm helping you out,
girl.
- Did they say we have to make
these comedy?
- Never hurts.
- You gotta grab your
attention--do like
the headlines that are on your
back to front cover.
- The thing is, like, me and
comedy obviously doesn't mix.
I think I'm just gonna be real
about it.
- I do not suggest you do this
for real.
I'm sorry.
I think you should make it
funny.
Everybody likes to laugh.
That's my advice to you.
- My only advice with that is
that if you feel like you can
get more with the serious route,
I'd rather you have a consistent
magazine that you can follow
by.
- Phi Phi...shady.
- 'Cause if you fuck up funny,
then it's gonna fuck up bad.
- Exactly.
For me, it's hard to find
the funny in weight loss.
Hell, no, no.
I'm gonna be serious, and I'm
gonna do this the right way
emotionally.
- He's doing a serious one
for his.
- What?
Are you kidding?
- No.
- His humor is, like,
his strongest thing.
- I know that he's gonna mess
up if he does, like, serious.
So I was like, "No,
you should do serious."
I'm tired of Jiggly.
She doesn't belong here.
Send her ass home.
Did you wanna help pack his
bags?
[laughs maniacally]
Ahh, you stupid bitch.
- Today we get to be
editors-in-chief
of our own dragazine.
- I have<i> Tastes Like Chicken.</i>
- We have to design a cover,
pose for it,
and come up with
eye-catching headlines.
"How to stop over-salting
your food,"
'cause I always hear people
talk about that.
Like, people always salt
their food too much, you know.
I really want to, like, almost
class this up a little bit.
It can easily come off as
offensive.
You know, a black woman on
the cover of a magazine saying--
with a title like that.
- [laughs]
Girl, go on.
- It's like, I don't even like
to really eat chicken in public.
- Girl, really?
- I don't eat watermelon in
public, because people are
ignorant and people make
comments.
- I know, girl, but--
- It's disrespectful and rude.
- 5 Gs, please.
Good God, get a grip, girl.
'Cause it's not that serious.
Really, you're a dude in a wig.
[laughs]
- Latrice, she set you up.
- She set me up.
Latrice was trying
to gook a bitch.
- [laughs]
- Can I please win a challenge?
Hopefully, I could exchange my
mini challenges for a win.
- You should step up your game,
girl.
Win a big one.
- So far in this competition,
I haven't won a main challenge.
Doing graphic and web design,
this is what I do
in my day job,
so if I lose this challenge,
it's gonna make me upset.
Honestly,
I don't want<i> Sugar Walls.</i>
- This is the one I wanted.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Well, I'm glad for you,
but I did not want that.
You're a sarcastic little bitch,
so you'll come up
with something.
- Where there's a Willam,
there's a way.
The only problem I'm having
in the workroom today is,
I just want to tell
the others girls,
"You can stop.
I'm gonna win."
- Hello, hello, hello.
[together]
Hi, Ru.
Hi.
- How are my future media
moguls doing?
- Fabulous.
- Well, well,
busy at work here.
<i>Tastes Like Chicken.</i>
How are you gonna convey Dida
in "Chicken of the Month?
- Well, "Chicken of the Month,"
I mean,
there's so many different ways
you can cook chicken.
- Seriously?
I would've took that whole
chicken thing into
a whole
different direction.
- You can broil it,
you can fry it.
- But how will we know this
is Dida?
- It's me.
Who else would think of
"Chicken of the month"?
I haven't heard Oprah come up
with it yet.
I mean,
you're fascinated by that.
You want to pick up the magazine
and look at it.
- Well...
- "Chicken of the Month" for me.
- Uh-huh, okay.
- I believe in my idea, and if
it makes me have to lip sync
for my life, then so be it.
- Phi Phi O'Hara.
<i>Sashay Away.</i>
So tell me about the cover.
- Well, I'm channeling
the horny gay, like 69 hot spots
for hookups.
- You know, the challenge is
to combine travel and Phi Phi
O'Hara's esthetic.
How are you gonna do that?
- Well, Phi Phi's sexy.
I'm just gonna, you know,
showcase my sexiness.
- This reminds me of when you
told me you were going to make
Lady Gaga really pop.
Do you remember that
conversation?
- She popped;
it might not have been in a
good way,
but she popped.
- All right, get to work.
- All righty, thanks, Ru.
- Sharon Needles.
- Hi.
-<i> Kitty Cat</i><span style="bodyStyle"> magazine.</i>
Who is this magazine for?
- Well, you know,
I see the cat magazines
at the pet store,
and they're always geared to,
like, grandmas and, like,
sad ladies that never
fell in love and stuff.
So this is more for, like,
Edie Beale,
that, you know, have cats,
because they're cheaper
than boyfriends.
- So, now, what does<i> </i>
<i>Kitty Cats</i><span style="bodyStyle"> magazine say</i>
about Sharon Needles?
- [meows]
- Now, listen.
I want you to make
your dragazine appeal to me.
Even though I don't have a cat.
I want you to make me want
to get a cat.
- Okay.
- And just knock 'em dead,
kiddo.
- I will.
Thanks a lot.
- Willam.
- Hi.
- Editrix-in-chief of
<i>Sugar Walls</i><span style="bodyStyle"> magazine.</i>
- I prefer editor-in-queef.
- [laughs]
So now who would you say is your
target audience for<i> Sugar Walls?</i>
- Um...
women.
Men.
- All of the above.
- Uh-huh.
- It's a little broad to just
do men and women.
And, you know, there is
a certain esthetic that you have
that's very clear-cut.
That's what we wanna see in this
magazine.
- Yes, ma'am.
- All right.
Jiggly Caliente.
- Hey, Mama.
- May I call you Jiggly?
- Oh, Mama,
you can call me Jiggly anytime.
- Oh.<i> Battle of the Bulge.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
- Yeah.
- Were you insulted by being
assigned that magazine?
- Yes, I've done some bad
things to lose weight.
- Well, what kind of things
have you done?
- I decided to binge and eat
a lot and throw it all up.
And I would say that it's not
the smartest thing to do.
And I just think that when it
comes to weight loss, it's not
a joking matter.
- You've been able to process
what people think of you through
your humor.
I mean, you're Jiggly Caliente.
That's your name.
Embrace the Jiggly.
- I am, I'm--
- Do you hear what I'm saying
to you?
- Yeah.
- You're funny.
Do that.
It's not rocket science.
- I'm going to stick to my guns,
because this,
I'm not questioning this.
This is the right way for me.
- Okay, all right.
Well, you got your work cut out
for you, Jiggly.
- Yes, I do.
- Think about it.
Chad Michaels.
- RuPaul.
- Editor-in-chief
of<i> Eleganza</i><span style="bodyStyle"> dragazine.</i>
- Finally.
- [laughs]
- I've been waiting.
<i>Eleganza</i><span style="bodyStyle"> magazine is going</i>
to be geared toward drags
and the women who love drags.
Sort of the major is gonna be,
"Dusted or Busted?
The Fashion and Runway Trashin'
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race: Season 4.</i>
- Oh, so this is an inside look
at some of the fashion
we've seen so far
in this season.
- And the inside scoop.
- I want to know that.
- It's gonna be fantastic.
- I can't wait to see
what the<i> Eleganza</i><span style="bodyStyle"> woman</i>
is wearing next season.
[roaring]
- I'd like to show you.
Drag cougar, honey.
- [laughs]
Them old girls still have it.
- Yes. All right, kiddo.
See you later.
- Thanks, Ru.
Thank you.
Well, Latrice Royale.
Girl,<i> What's the T?</i>
- What's the T, Ru?
- How are you gonna make your
dragazine something that is
relevant in the 21st century?
- You're gonna wanna buy it
once you see me on the cover
because everyone knows that
Latrice is the true "T".
- Well, the publications at
the grocery have stars on
the cover, and they have star
names in their articles.
- Oh.
So I'm gonna go back to my
research department.
- Yes.
- I'll get it there.
- You get to it.
- Thank you.
- All right, dolls,
gather round.
Tomorrow night is the launch
of your dragazines.
We'll be joined by our extra
special guest judges.
platinum-selling country artist
Pam Tillis will be here.
- Yee-haw!
- Pam Tillis, old-school
country diva, honey.
- And an actress I've loved
since she was a child on<i> 227.</i>
The star TV's<i> Southland,</i>
Regina King will be here.
[cheering]
- I love Regina King.
She's on a show called<i> </i>
<i>Southland.</i>
Oh, wait, I was on a show called
<i>Southland.</i>
- Oh, and one last thing.
Don't fuck it up.
All right, bye.
- Bye, Ru.
- Hi, gorgeous.
- Hi.
Ooh, hi. How are you?
- Good,
I'm Jonathan Clay Harris.
So what are we doing today?
- Our challenge this week is,
we have to develop our own
dragazine.
So now we're gonna pose for our
fabulous cover.
My magazine
is<i> Tastes Like Chicken.</i>
I want it to be a sexy magazine
but with chicken.
- Yeah, give me some sexy.
Sex appeal with that one.
Oh, my God, chicken?
Chicken?
- Chicken.
- Yeah, work that chicken.
Show me a little hunger
in those eyes.
- What drag queen do you know
that has taken a head shot
with chicken?
Chicken!
- And what are you serving
for dinner tonight?
- Look at you.
You look gorgeous.
- Yeah, you too.
- Oh, thank you.
- Have you done porn?
- Not recently.
- Well, you should really
consider it.
Thought it would be a genius
idea mounting the cat climber,
channeling my inner kitty cat.
- Just be careful.
- I can trust myself.
- All right, Sharon, I don't
think this is working.
Let's go back.
- God, you don't know anything
about fashion.
Okay, we're gonna just do
chairs.
- There you go.
- Work that hand...
<i>Eleganza.</i>
- I wanted to seem like
a powerful bitchy mogul woman.
- Let's get a little more of
that pussy in there.
There you are.
Beautiful, right there.
- I was totally giving
the camera nothing but legs,
and I was giving them pure
cunt face.
- Beautiful.
- I feel sexy in anything,
even a body bag.
- Hello.
How are you?
- Oh, wow.
- So what's your magazine cover
that you're doing today?
- I'm doing, uh...
what was it?
Bulge of--<i> </i>
<i>Battle of the Bulge.</i>
-<i> Battle of the Bulge,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> okay.</i>
Are those RuPaul's
Iron Fist shoes?
- Yeah, these are RuPaul
Iron Fist shoes.
- Those are amazing.
- Aren't they sickening?
- They're sickening.
- This is the most exercise I'm
gonna get for the rest
of my life.
- Oh, no.
Here we go.
Little<i> Kill Bill</i><span style="bodyStyle"> action.</i>
Here we go.
- God, if Phi Phi was just in
front of me, I could've knocked
her ass out for all that shit
she be running her mouth with.
Please don't trip me.
- We won't.
- One, two, three.
- Okay, once more, here we go.
[laughs]
- Doesn't matter, as long as
it looks like
it's in the air.
- Let's do it again.
Loosen a little bit.
Just mind your face
when you're jumping.
- Okay, I'm cool.
One, two...
- I just didn't think that
it kind of worked with Jiggly.
She just seemed so completely
uncomfortable with the camera.
- And you have to spot me.
- Point your eyes at me just
for a couple frames.
Gorgeous.
Look at those eyes.
- So my final wardrobe for
the photograph is really kind
of a '40s glam red carpet dress.
I could see someone like
Veronica Lake wearing it to
a movie premiere.
- And what do the goggles say
about your outfit?
- The goggles say,
"she's an adventurer and she's
fashion-forward."
- She looks like it.
- Right now it is important for
me to get out there and give
the judges some variety to be
a little bit less polished,
to be avant-garde.
I think I'm good.
I think we got it.
- I wanna look like--like--
like a hot Miami piece of ass.
Like you wanna visit me.
- Work, here we go.
You look like it to me.
- Good.
- Let's do it.
Miami, honey.
I wanna go for a more sexier
side of Phi Phi, something that
I haven't showed yet, and, you
know, I wanna be, like, a whore
on this magazine and have whore
headlines.
- Let's see some sex
in those eyes.
Here we go.
- I'm throwing you, like,
a Farrah Fawcett sexy look,
and, you know, I had the drink
in my hand.
I'm holding the umbrella.
Hold on, I don't want
my muscles showing.
I gotta look like a woman.
- You wanna look at 'em?
- Yeah, I feel sexy already.
So let's look at 'em.
I'm prettier than the other
girls, aren't I?
You can say it.
- I'm not going to.
- You should.
Delete that one.
That looks like a man.
I look like Sharon in that one.
- Okay.
[laughter]
Ouch.
- Yes, Mama, right there.
Good.
Beautiful.
Boys, I want you touching her.
- So<i> What's the T?</i><span style="bodyStyle"> is a gossip</i>
column magazine.
Of course I'm featured on the
cover with my boys.
The boys.
Always helps when you have boys.
Come and join me on the couch.
Let's have a ménage à trois.
The boys, of course, is just for
my sheer amusement and pleasure.
Come do something.
Come rub on me.
Let me rub on you.
- Latrice, look at me.
Eyes at me, everyone.
Eyes at me.
Sex in the face.
Look at me.
- I love my boys,
and that's the "T".
- Sex sells, people.
Sex sells.
My overall concept is
stripped-down design.
Mama needs some tape.
Your head is so unprofessional.
- [chuckling]
- I tried to dress the pit crew
as lamps and put lamp shades on
their head, but their heads
aren't even.
And they wouldn't let me put
nails in them.
And remember to flex, boys.
I don't want you looking puny.
[laughter]
No faces, you don't exist.
- Willam was beautiful and
definitely knew her body.
- [laughing]
- I thought she was a little
bitchy.
You guys look amazing.
- Please don't address them.
- Right.
- You can't fuck me.
[laughs]
I'm gonna fall.
- Good.
Let's take a look at these.
- I'm naked, I'm tan,
and I have boys around me.
I'm happy with the photo shoot.
All right, now clean this
shit up.
[upbeat music]
[indistinct chatter]
- Good morning,
mother cluckers.
- We're back.
- We're back!
- We're back in the workroom
today,
and we're getting ready
to present our magazines on
the runway in our glossy glamour
looks.
- How did your challenge go
for you guys?
- Mine went well.
- I liked mine.
- Well, you have a health and
fitness magazine.
Why would you go serious
on that?
Obviously you were assigned
that magazine to, you know,
ham it up.
[laughter]
- There's more to me than just
being funny and goofy.
1240 on the SATs.
I need to show that I have
intelligence.
Girl.
- Latrice, does your family
still live--where are you from
again?
- Atlanta.
- Have you ever been, like,
bullied or whatever by family?
- From my brother, yeah.
He didn't want no punk for
a brother.
- My dad did that in front of,
like,
his fucking drinking
buddies.
I grew up in a house where
I was beat and made fun of for
being gay.
It was hell.
Family's supposed to love you
no matter what.
And if that's love,
I don't want it.
- You couldn't hold hands,
kiss, look at each other in
Texas without getting called
a faggot or anything.
- What kills me is that they
wanna say that we're the ones
destroying the institution
of marriage.
Please.
- You know, I've met gay people,
though,
that don't agree with
gay marriage.
- I--okay, here we go.
Since y'all brought it up.
- Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh.
- I just don't want it to be
called marriage.
For me, marriage describes
a straight relationship.
And I think we should be called
something else.
Call it something more fabulous.
- As a gay man, it's just hard
for me to believe that you don't
want equal rights for yourself.
- I did not say that.
- But if it's all the same
thing as marriage,
why not call it that?
- Because it's not the same
thing to me.
- Yes, it is.
- I will be pissed if Latrice
is gonna be the first one that
gets married too, bitch.
- Hell to the no.
- I fully support gay divorce.
- [laughing]
- [laughing]
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, gorgeous.
- Hey, Ru.
- Welcome to the main stage of
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
Michelle Visage, you old tool.
- What you talking 'bout, tool?
- On newsstands everywhere,
it's Santino Rice.
- Lookin' beautiful
as a fresh bruise.
Black and blue.
- Grammy award-winner
Pam Tillis.
I am so excited you're here.
- You are like a song.
I'm telling you.
[trills tongue]
- [laughs]
And Regina King.
Hey, girl, you look like
a cover girl.
- Oh, thank you.
So do you.
You have to show me how you
create the hair blowing without
the fan look.
- [laughs]
This week, our queens went to
the presses to launch a new
dragazine, and now they're ready
to pump up your circulation.
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.
First up, Sharon Needles in
black and white, editorial.
- She's black and white and
fierce all over.
- This is a glamorous look for
Sharon Needles.
- It is.
- I'm feeling like
the Tim Burton
vintage sci-fi glamazon.
I feel stunning.
- Her booty looks awesome
in that dress.
- Yes, thanks, DuPont.
Very<i> Valley of the Dolls.</i>
- I was thinking
Jackie Collins.
- Kind of like a possessed
Jackie Collins.
- Yes, yes.
Up next, Dida Ritz.
- Not just a cracker.
- No.
- What'd you call me?
- I love the little "S" walk.
- Yes, it's a strategic walk
so a sniper can't get her.
[laughter]
- I'm serving you
editor-in-chief realness.
Old Hollywood glamour.
I feel sexy.
- Tastes like chicken.
Looks like fish.
- Uh-uh.
- Chad Michaels.
Rock and roll.
- Lita Ford.
- Pat Benatar.
- Tonight I'm wearing something
more dangerous.
My paint is much darker
than usual.
I'm loving my short hair.
I'm feeling fantastic.
-<i> Guns &amp; Ammo</i><span style="bodyStyle"> magazine.</i>
Cover of<i> Rolling Stone.</i>
- Where is her Stratocaster?
- Yes.
- It's hidden.
- Latrice Royale.
<i>Ebony</i><span style="bodyStyle"> magazine.</i>
- Foldout.
- Yes, honey, this is
a two-page spread.
- I walk out giving my Gothy
glam, very Nubian princess,
lots of jewels and cleavage,
and I feel gorgeous.
- She makes glamour look
real simple.
- I love the jewels down the
back.
- Yes, gorgeous.
- Like a character from<i> </i>
<i>The Wiz.</i>
- Uh-huh.
- Up next, Willam.
Red carpet ready.
- Kylie Minogue.
- Kylie min-yes.
- Just the whole body, jeez.
- Uh-huh.
- I feel confident
on the runway.
I'm just giving them cute girl,
fish salad realness with a side
of Teddy.
- Hollywood starlet.
- Back action and everything.
- I want a lifetime
subscription.
- Jiggly Caliente.
- Venus de Brooklyn.
- Build me up, buttercup.
- Uh-huh.
- I want the judges to take it
all in, catch it.
Look at all the Swarovskis.
I want them to try to count how
many Swarovski there are on
this gown.
I look like a fucking
lemon drop.
A blinging lemon drop.
- That's a pretty dress.
- It is gorgeous.
I love me a train.
- Mm.
I'm gonna leave that alone.
- Phi Phi O'Hara.
- Ooh.
- Wow.
Serving body and turquoise.
- I love the proportion.
- Yeah.
- Love all that leg.
Beautiful.
- Go on and take
the center stage.
- Walking down the runway,
I'm feeling super sexy and
flirty, and I'm just having
a good time out there.
It's a fishy outfit,
I look really pretty in it.
I look glamorous.
- This is the best Phi Phi
has ever looked.
Very<i> Cosmo</i><span style="bodyStyle"> girl.</i>
No Photoshop necessary.
Hello, dolls.
Let's find out whose dragazines
are fresh and fabulous, and
whose are just conde nasty.
Up first, Chad Michaels.
<i>Eleganza.</i>
- Yes.
- I wanted to take the theme
of<i> Eleganza,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> which was style,</i>
and gear it toward drag cougars
and the women who love them.
- I didn't know what type of
magazine it was.
It's just all over the place.
- It looks like something that
you would pick up for free at
the grocery store.
You look beautiful tonight.
Love the one-shoulder.
You look great in black.
- You guys challenged me to
dirty it up a little bit,
and I feel fantastic.
- I love that Chad thinks
this is dirty.
I guess it is for Chad.
- All right, up next,
Dida Ritz.
<i>Tastes Like Chicken.</i>
- Yeah, that's what they say.
- I wanted to add a little bit
of, you know, glamour to it,
and my inspiration was really
the type of women you see on
the Food Network.
- I saw "stop."
It kind of is at odds with your
fun look and your fun colors,
and then this negative message.
- I like black hair on you.
It looks very pretty.
Just next time think more
volume.
I keep telling you more volume.
It's all about the silhouette.
- All right, next up,
Sharon Needles.
<i>Kitty Cats.</i>
Meow.
- I wanted to create a hip cat
magazine for, like, young
hipsters that love cats.
- Oh, you nasty bitch.
You--oh, my God, I love
the headlines.
I just wanna read it.
I wanna know how many is too
many.
- Well, I'm talking about cats.
You're a pervert.
- Oh, I know, I know,
I know.
But the eyes scare me.
- They're my trademark.
- But everything else is just
so pretty and elegant.
It, like, creeps me out.
- I am still waiting to see
full-on glam, no eyes,
no Goth Sharon Needles.
Just once.
I don't think you'll lose you.
- Next up, Latrice Royale.
<i>What's the T?</i>
- If my magazine was on the
newsstand, if you're not picking
it up for me, you're definitely
gonna pick it up for the hot
boys that are lusting after me,
so...
- I sort of expected your
magazine to be like, "Shh!"
- It looks like the name of the
magazine is "Hollywood."
It looks more like a club flyer.
- You don't need the pit crew
boys on there at all.
It really looks like you got
some hookers somewhere.
- This gown that you came out
in, it's like, ugh,
that's so heavy.
It looks like a couch from
Rent-A-Center.
- I think there's a little too
much jewelry; I don't know.
- Oh, Lord, Jesus.
-<i> Showgirls.</i>
[laughter]
- Oh, oh.
- Oh.
My bracelet breaks.
Oh, fuck.
In front of everybody.
- But already that looks
better.
It does.
- Next up, Willam.
<i>Sugar Walls.</i>
- I love home design, and I
made one of the pillows
on the cover.
I'm a power bottom like that.
- I love what you look like
tonight, but in the beard area,
we see the shadow again tonight.
- Touch this.
Touch all of this.
- I'm trying to help because
you're the only one that has it.
So it really hits hard when it's
out there.
- Your dragazine cover is
possibly the worst one.
I hate the font.
- Me too.
- Okay.
- This looks like a porn thing
about to happen.
I'm getting anything but
decorating from this.
- Yeah, I wouldn't have hired
myself to be that designer.
I love the ideas that I had.
I wish I had more time to
execute them and a better staff.
- See, my career I've had to do
every single part of
show business.
You know, edit, produce,
you name it.
And that's what we're really
looking for.
Next up, Jiggly Caliente.
May I call you Jiggly?
- No.
- [laughs]
<i>Battle of the Bulge.</i>
- I found the funny, and I
found the silly humor in it.
<i>Battle of the Bulge,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
ya, ya, ya!
- I think with<i> Battle of the</i>
<i>Bulge</i><span style="bodyStyle"> you could have really</i>
taken it anywhere.
- Yeah, because when we spoke
in the workroom, I was going on
and on about you should approach
it with more humor.
- I chose to play with words
instead of the humor because
I don't know anything about
fitness.
What the hell would I write
about, how to eat a pound
of chicken?
- Exactly, that's funny.
- Oh, damn.
[laughter]
- Next up, Phi Phi O'Hara.
You got<i> Sashay Away,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
the travel dragazine.
Wow, va-va-voom.
- This is the best I've ever
seen you look so far.
- Yeah, all the proportions
are right.
Cute little outfit.
Your makeup looks lovely.
- Thank you.
- What happened?
[laughing]
- You look gorgeous on
the cover.
The color makes me wanna go
wherever you are.
This looks like an actual
magazine.
- You picked all the key words
to highlight.
Bathhouse, 69, virginity.
I would read this inside
and out.
- All right, ladies, while you
enjoy an Absolut cocktail in
the Interior Illusions Lounge,
the judges and I will
deliberate.
All right, just between us
girls, what do you think?
Chad Michaels.
- The runway really made up for
the look that's on the cover
of<i> Eleganza</i><span style="bodyStyle"> magazine,</i>
which is horrible.
- And it's just not modern
or hip.
- If you're looking for hip,
young, and trendy, you ain't
gonna find it in Chad Michaels.
- Dida Ritz.
- I'm just kind of thinking
she's somewhere in the middle
today.
She was cute on the cover.
- I never equate fabulous drag
queens and cute.
- Right.
- I wanna be devastated.
- She comes out like a straight
line with these big football
player shoulders with flat hair.
She's a pretty girl, but it
seems like we're getting stuck
here a little bit with Dida.
- All right, let's move on to
Sharon Needles.
- I really like her sense of
comedy.
There's something really cool
about her.
- Yeah, her dragazine,
very funny, tongue in cheek.
And it looks like it reeks of
cat piss in there.
- I did like her dragazine.
- Do I think it's the best?
No.
- Latrice Royale.
- The dragazine cover was like
Sydney Biddle Barrows, you know?
It was like a madam's calling
card.
- Willam and<i> Sugar Walls</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
dragazine.
- She totally missed the mark,
and I really feel like this was
probably one of the easiest
ones to do.
And there's something about her
on stage that's a bit robotic.
It's like she stood there with
the same exact smile.
It was kind of creepy.
I kept, like, looking over to
see, all right, okay, 20 minutes
has passed by, and she was
still...
- Yeah, that don't move.
- She's got a major attitude,
and I like that, though.
Good news, bad news.
Good news, she's a diva.
Bad news, she's a diva.
- Jiggly Caliente and
<i>Battle of the Bulge.</i>
- You know, Jiggly seems to be
some sort of self-sabotage.
- Yes.
- Maybe she doesn't feel like
she deserves to be here.
- Right.
- And if you don't believe it,
nobody else will.
- Moving on to Phi Phi O'Hara
and<i> Sashay Away</i><span style="bodyStyle"> magazine.</i>
This looked like the most
professional magazine of
the whole bunch.
- It did, but as we're going
through all of these I'm
wondering did it look like
the most professional because
everything else was so bad?
- [laughs]
- I had a problem with the fact
that she wore
a blonde cap with
blonde hair.
She looked like she had a dead
baby lamb on her head.
- And who wants that?
- Nobody.
- Sharon Needles.
- There'd be blood coming out.
- Silence!
I've made my decision.
Bring back my girls.
Welcome back, ladies.
Based on your dragazines and
your presentations on the main
stage, I've made some decisions.
[suspenseful music]
Phi Phi O'Hara, your travel
dragazine was a real trip.
And we're excited that you keep
taking us to new places.
You are the winner of this
week's challenge.
[applause]
- Ah, thank God.
- You've won a cruise to
the Bahamas courtesy of
alandchuck.travel.
- Oh, man.
[laughs]
Oh, finally.
This is my first win, and I'm
really excited because it's nice
to know that my hard work has
paid off.
Those girls better watch out.
- Sharon Needles, you're safe.
Dida Ritz...
you're safe.
- Thank you.
- Chad Michaels.
- Yes, ma'am?
- This week the judges were not
gagging on your<i> Eleganza.</i>
You...
are safe.
- [exhales]
Thank you.
- Jiggly Caliente, once again
you left us hungry for more.
I'm sorry, my dear, but you are
up for elimination.
- Again?
Seriously?
That's just straight-up jank.
- Latrice Royale...
you're safe.
Willam, I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
- When Ru tells me about being
in the bottom two,
I feel shaken,
and it's a little scary.
- Two queens stand before me.
Prior to tonight you were asked
to prepare a lip sync
performance of<i> Mi Vida Loca</i>
by Pam Tillis.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me and save yourself
from elimination.
The time has come for you to
lip sync...for your life.
- I'm gonna fight till the end.
No way I'm gonna let this skinny
Botox bitch send my ass home.
- Good luck and don't fuck
it up.
- I mean, I hate to say it,
but I think Willam did good.
She looked very much a young
country pop star.
- God damn, you couldn't give
me a Lil' Kim song?
- I really, really wished
I had panties on.
But I didn't think I'd have
to lip sync.
- Jiggly is pretty much
standing in one spot.
Not good.
[applause]
- Bravo.
- Ladies,
I've made my decision.
Willam...
shantay, you stay.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
And I'll always try to do
my best.
If I fall short, I'm sorry.
- Jiggly Caliente,
may I call you Jiggly?
- Yes.
- Good, because after your time
here, you'll be on a first-name
basis with millions of fans.
Now, sashay away.
- Thank you so much.
I love you.
Deuces.
- [laughs]
- I'm disappointed, but I know
my mom would be so proud of me.
I fucking fought my way.
And it just didn't happen.
But life goes on.
It's all good.
- My sensational six.
The race to become America's
next drag superstar is still
wide open.
Now remember, if you can't love
yourself how in the hell are you
gonna love somebody else?
Can I get an amen up in here?
all: Amen.
- All right,
now let the music play.


-<i> Previously on</i>
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race...</i>
My top three,
the best of the best.
- Morning, bitches.

We gotta get back to

- Excuse my beauty.
- I don't know why they book me
on these chicken shit gigs.
- [laughing]
- I'm a fucking oscar-winner.
[cheers and applause]
- Sharon Needles.
- This is my kinda ghoul.
- I might not be
the biggest star here,
but I got
the biggest knockers, okay?
Ha ha ha ha ha!
[laughter]
- Take me to your leader.
- Yes, just a little prick
in the mouth.
- Oh, you nasty bitch.
[laughter]
- I'm the fucking
future of drag!
Why?
Because I'm sickening, bitch!
[laughs]
I'm Sharon Needles,
sharing responsibility.
- Well, hello, hello.
- Phi Phi O'Hara,
survivor of the Rupocalypse.
Va-va-voom.
Her legs are like
peanut butter--easy to spread.
- You're me.
- That's what I was channeling.
- I loved it.
- Now I'm gonna show you how to
really beat a mug, bitch!
- Well, poo-poo-pi-doo!
Phi Phi's the shit.
- [laughing]
- Have three words for you--
fab-u-lous.
- Thank you.
- And tonight, the winner
of RuPaul's Drag Race,
America's
next drag superstar, is...
- The winner of

- This is the top three,

that I'm finally here.
I'm so excited.
- We bow to you,
fierceness diva.
- You are our ebony goddess.
And we will see you again soon.
- Bye, sister.
Coming down the runway,
400 pounds.
Coming down the runway
in a velvet gown.
It don't matter.
- Our sister Latrice
had a lot of spirit.
And I'll miss her.
- Remember the first day here,
just walking in here
and not knowing anyone?
It's like the first day
in prison, you know?
- Like the first day of school.
- It has been kind of like a
long therapy session.
- Almost.
It's therapy, rehab,
prison, school.
- This is the hardest thing
I've ever had to do.
- Girl, we've done some shit.
- First we got chased
by zombies.
- Drag queen zombies.
- I was so scraped up
and bruised from all of that.
- Just battered.
- We've walked down that runway
pregnant, with a dog,
and in a boat.
- What about
the wet T-shirt contest?
- Oh, I hated it.
- My mother's gonna be
so proud of that one.
- This is actually
who I thought
would make the top three.
- Well, I'll be honest,
I'm shocked
that I'm in the top
three.
I can't even win a pageant
in a bar in Pittsburgh.
And here I am.
- So, you guys, the runway was
pretty rough last week.
- Which one of these bitches
does not deserve to be
in the top three?
- I would say Phi Phi.
- Phi Phi O'Hara.
- Bullshit.
- Are you guys feeling okay
about everything, or...
- Oh, I still hate both
of y'all.
- I think there was
a misunderstanding.
- We basically can agree
to disagree.
When it boils down to it,
we like each other.
I like you, Phi Phi.
Now, go home.
[alarm whirring]
- Ooh...girl!
<i>You got shemail.</i>
My queens, the chosen three,
you have survived
the end of the world,
bitch fights,
pregnant daddies,
and boatloads
of proud seamen.
Damn!
But your biggest test
is yet to come.
Which one of my girls will take
a giant step
and join me
in my elite squadron
of fighting glamazons.
Today,<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
Tomorrow, the world.
[cackling]
[laughter]
- Hello, hello, hello, ladies.
- Hey, Ru.
- [laughing] Wow.
My girls.
Now, your resilient charisma,
uniqueness, nerve, and talent
earned you your place
in the top three.
But now it's time for
the ultimate test.
For your final challenge...
you'll be starring with me
in my new music video,
the fashion adventure
extravaganza,
<i>Glamazon.</i>
[laughter and cheers]
- Ah, it's so exciting.
- You'll have to dance, act,
style, and lip-synch
for your life...
as you work with director
Mathu Anderssen
and choreographer Candis Cayne.
- All right!
- Awesome.
- Now, I said it before,
and I'll say it again.
Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best woman win.
- Hello, girls.
Congratulations.
both: Thank you.
- Thank you so much.
- Miss Candis Cayne.
She's a famous superstar,
and is a fantastic dancer.
- Do any of you guys have
any dance experience?
- I do.
- Um, a little.
- A little.
Okay.
Well, you know, this is your
final challenge.
So it is super important that
you guys bring it.
- Okay.
- The concept of my
choreography
is high fashion
dragzilla primal glamour.
You turn, two, three.
Four and five.
Six, and then you repeat that,
but going back.
One, two...Sharon,
you wanna go this way.
- Okay.
Yes, right.
- Six, seven, eight!
Okay, stop.
You're spinning twice.
- Okay.
- So you should only spin
once there.
- Got it. Sorry.
Can you tell I'm shaking?
- It's okay.
It's all right.
- So why don't we start
one by one.
We'll start with you, Phi Phi.
- Okay.
- One, two, three, and four.
Five, stop, hit, hit.
Phi Phi, she's great;
she has the steps,
but she's also
a little cha-cha.
Let's try you, Chad.
One, two, three, and four.
Five, six, seven, eight.
It's a little too, uh, girly.
Let's try you.
- All right.
- It doesn't have to be pretty.
- Mm-hmm.
Thank God.
No.
[laughing] I'm teasing.
I'm joking, I'm joking.
One, two, three, and four.
Okay, let me just go over it
with you.
So just look at my feet.
I'm most worried about Sharon.
If you don't get the steps down,
you can't perform the video.
And then on this leg, you go,
step, step, step.
- Step, step...
Oh, goodness.
It's just so fast.
I am intimidated
that the other girls
are picking this up
a lot quicker than me.
This is just far too difficult.
- I just want you guys to do
the best you can do, okay?
- It's hard.
- Let's beat this face, ladies.
- Now it's time to
change into our
beautiful monster outfits
for the<i> Glamazon</i><span style="bodyStyle"> video.</i>
- And this really is gonna be
the coolest video.
- Our looks for the music video
are kind of a mixture between
1950s B-horror films
meets an issue of Italian<i> Vogue.</i>
Work.
You know what those monster
costumes remind me of?
- What?
- GWAR.
- Uh-huh.
- What's GWAR?
- "What's GWAR?"
- Talk about edgy.
- GWAR is, like, some crazy
'80s, like,
pop punk metal band,
but they wear
all latex monster costumes.
- Oh, why would I know that,
though?
- Because it's drag.
- Yeah, well...
- Oh.
- Coming from "never seen
<i>Paris is Burning."</i>
- I fell asleep.
- Ah!
As drag queens, I think of
ourselves as funhouse mirrors.
We reflect pop culture
back to the world,
and I think to be America's
next drag superstar,
you have to be exactly that.
- Fell asleep during
<i>Paris is Burning.</i>
- I was tired.
Chad and Sharon, they're old.
Screw them.
Let them watch their TV.
I have better things to do,
like become America's
next drag superstar.
- Candis Cayne
was an amazing instructor.
- I love that dance.
I thought the dance was fun.
- I hate it.
I just don't dance like that.
It freaks me out.
- Yeah, 'cause, I mean,
at this point,
we have to be perfect.
At this point, I kind of hope
Sharon messes up.
I want to win this.
- See, that's the shot.
- It is time,
ladies and gentlemen.
We're gonna start serving
Godzilla realness.
- And cue.
- And cut.
Honey, help that girl.
Sharon needs to stay
on her line.
- Huh?
- You're drifting in to Chad.
Try your best to stay straight.
- If you drift out of it,
the shot's kind of fucked
for everyone.
- All right.
- One, two, three, four.
Five, stop, hit, hit.
- Pose.
- Was I a little better?
- It was only one "wah" as
opposed to two "wah."
- It's just one song, Sharon.
- It needs to be together.
- We cannot
drop the ball on this.
- Action.
- [sighs]
- We're jumping ship.
You're supposed to go
in the front,
she goes in the back,
I cut through the middle.
So it's that easy.
- I feel like I'm on
<i>Candid Camera,</i>
and I'm the butt of the joke.
- Let's get through
the fucking dance
in the half an hour that
we've got to do it in.
- [whispering] Jesus Christ.
Sharon needs to get this,
and she needs to get it now.
- Oh, fuck, fuck me.
- This is gonna be
a crap video.
- Hi, Phi Phi.
- Hi, Chad.
- After the choreography
debacle yesterday,
it's important for me to do well
in the rest of
the music video.
- What's on the mirror?
- It says, "Meet us
in the ladies' room."
- Who's "us"?
- Could it be, like, some of
the departed girls?
- [feigns sobbing]
- What do you think it is?
- I don't even know.
- Let's go.
- Let's go check it out.
Oh, god.
- [chuckling]
- [gasps]
both: Surprise!
[laughter]
- It's Tyra and Raja,
winners of season two
and three.
- Hi, mama.
- Hi, baby.
I'm gonna cry.
Hold on.
- Raja and I,
we've worked together
for ten-plus years.
And I just have
a lot of love for Raja.
- Hello, ladies.
- Hello.
- We've got one more little
twist to share with you.
- You'll be acting with
Miss RuPaul herself.
- Cool.
- In a face-slapping,
gut-punching, kick-ass scene.
- Work.
- Oh...and you'll be having
a one-on-one lunch with Ru.
So a little piece of
sisterly advice.
both: Don't fuck it up.
- Oh, I'm starving, Ru.
- Oh, good.
- How are you?
- I'm terrific.
- You look so beautiful.
- Now you get to see me
up close and personal.
- [laughs]
And, by the way,
if you're hungry,
just have a bite.
- Well, actually, I haven't
eaten since 1972, Ru.
That's how I stay thin.
- Oh, good for you.
- Isn't that great?
- I want to ask you,
over the course of your time
here,
people, Michelle,
talked about, um,
you being so perfect.
- Right.
- Because you're very poised,
and you say
all the right things.
And I think she just
wanted to see
that vulnerable edge
that every superstar has.
- I'm me all the time.
And if it's not edgy enough,
then so be it.
- Now, are your parents
still with us?
- Yes, my parents are with us.
I actually live with my mom.
My father is nearby,
but, um, still a little bit
estranged.
- Why is that?
- It's been a long 25 years of,
um, me not forgiving.
I felt like my father really
chose another family over--
over me and my mom.
And it's just recently that...
I'm realizing how much it
affected me.
- How does it manifest?
- Sometimes, it's easy for me
to disconnect from things.
And not...
really face my own feelings
about my father.
- Is it possible that
the invulnerability
that Michelle
is talking about
is exactly what
you're describing?
- Could be.
- I bet that's what it is.
I'm just wondering if that is
your breakthrough moment
in terms of
not only this contest,
but, you know, in your life.
- It could very well be.
- Thank you so much, Chad.
- Thank you, Ru,
it's been an honor to be here.
- Take these for the road.
- Thank you, darling.
I'll see you on the runway.
- All right.
- All right, mama.
- What's going on?
- Oh, other than
losing my mind?
I'm having a hell of a time.
- All you need to remember
is that right now,
you're in the heat
of the competition,
there's only three of you left,
but once this is all done,
regardless if you win
and get that prize
and the crown
and so on,
your life is about to
absolutely fucking change.
- Right.
- Of course it's better to win.
- Yes.
- Yeah, it's better to win.
- Yes, yes.
- Well, you know,
I'm used to being a loser,
but I really hope that I do win.
I want to let every loser
out there know
that there can be a giant crown
on their head.
There are so many of me's,
all around the world.
People who want to
express themselves
in unconventional ways.
If I win<i> RuPaul's Drag race,</i>
it will definitely show them
that anything is possible.
- Let's just go over
some of it.
- All I ever wanted was to be
a female phenomenon.
- [laughing]
I like the fact that you can
modify your voice,
'cause I've never
had that talent.
- I modify my voice
all the time.
- Yeah.
[laughs]
- Girl.
- I'll be Ru.
You ready?
- Uh-huh.
- You sure?
- Punch her! Hit her! Get her!
- Ohh!
- Hey! Yes!
- Uhh! Oh!
- Damn bitch knocked
my bracelet off.
- Work!
That was awesome.
Ohh!
- Phi Phi, darling!
- You look amazing.
- Oh, you're just saying that.
- No, for real.
- Are you hungry?
- I'm hungry.
- Well, that's what
everyone says--
you're so hungry and
ambitious.
- I have a drive,
and I have a strong drive,
and I really
wanted to prove to you guys
and show you guys,
especially you,
that I can do whatever it takes.
- Does that come from having
an army dad,
where you feel like,
"I want daddy's approval"?
- I mean, I haven't talked to
him for seven years now.
- What was the last thing
you said to him?
- It was a fight, actually.
I-I don't even remember.
I was put in the hospital.
- By him?
- By him, on my 18th birthday,
so I haven't--
there wasn't many words.
[laughs] So...
- Wow.
- But I'm here!
So--so it's okay.
If anything, it taught me to be,
you know, a fighter and stay
strong and...
I guess, because I grew up in
such a situation,
I feel like maybe
it felt like
it was normal at times, but...
I shouldn't have felt that way.
- I want you to walk away
from this luncheon
and remember this idea
that you would deserve
to be abused
or not thought of
as absolutely beautiful,
never think that again.
- I really feel like
we connected,
and she understands
a lot more of the heart
of who I am.
- So, um, what's it been like
so far?
Who's your biggest competition?
- Sharon Needles.
We're like kindred spirits.
- Yeah.
- And, um...
- Have you guys ki-kied?
- [laughing] No, we have not
ki-kied.
- What's your relationship like
with Phi Phi?
- She's definitely comin'
after me.
But it's okay!
You know, we got a big age
difference between us.
And I've commented on Phi Phi's
maturity level,
but I also have
to remember she's 25,
and I remember when I was 25.
- Well, I'm 23.
- You're that young?
- Yeah.
- Jesus Christ.
- Only 23.
- And look at your position.
- Though we've had our spats,
maybe I'm not tolerating
that amazing kid
for who she is.
- So really just go for it
and be larger than life
about it.
You know?
- You promised to make me
a panther on the runway.
- Well, stand in line, girly.
- Slap her!
Uhh! Yeah!
Ohh! There you go.
Woooork.
- If I knew it was so formal,
I would have changed.
- [laughing]
- You look absolutely stunning.
- Why, thank you.
- Even from this close,
you can't clock a lace-front,
girl.
You gotta love that.
I'm just--I'm looking
for a problem.
- Well, there are several.
So, now, Sharon, I know you have
people back in Pittsburgh
that you love
and that you're worried about
what this experience would
do to the relationship.
- Oh, most definitely.
- We're talking about Alaska,
aren't we?
- Alaska has tried out for this
competition all four years.
I've tried out for this
competition once--this year.
I just wish I could
speak to him,
you know, and just see
if it was okay.
- What would you say?
I'm Alaska.
What would you say?
- I love you so much
and, in my eyes,
you're the biggest
superstar in the universe.
I just pray this doesn't
do any damage.
- I'm gonna tell you what
Alaska would say.
It's fine.
I would never stand in the way
of your success,
which is your destiny.
- Hmm.
- And Alaska has a destiny.
We all have a journey,
and it is up to you
to see it through.
- RuPaul gives nothing more
than good advice.
But I definitely have a fear of
success and fame.
It intimidates me.
- All right, see you later.
- [mouth full] Yes, ma'am.
- Needles.
How'd it go, mama?
What's wrong, baby?
Aww.
[chuckles]
It's okay. It's okay.
- Touching little witch.
- [laughs]
- God!
I knew this was all
coming to an end,
and it was the first time
I really realized
that everything truly
is going to be different.
And this is a big deal.
Oh, jeez, Louise.
- What's goin' on?
- Not much. Top three.
- Yeah!
Whoo hoo hoo!
- I know, it's crazy.
- Do you think
that you being young
has been a challenge for you
in this competition?
- Well, I'm 25.
I think a lot of people use that
as kind of like a...
like an excuse, really.
And I don't let that--
- Well, when I did the show,
I was 21.
So don't let anyone, like,
hold you back.
- Oh, I haven't.
- Being young is being fun.
- Just like me, everybody was
ganging up on Tyra
because she was the baby,
or they felt like she had
too much attitude.
So the fact that someone can win
at a young age
and still be a great role model
and America's next drag
superstar,
why can't I?
- Now sashay!
- Uhh!
- Shante!
- Ohh!
- Shante! Shante! Shante!
- Aah!
- Why does the little one
get beat up?
Uhh!
- Wonder how ol'
Phi Phi's doing.
- Disneying it up somewhere.
- In a way,
I feel bad about, like,
saying some of the shit
I said to her.
I feel bad.
- Yeah, I know.
- Who the fuck am I
to tell her to grow up?
- [humming]
- How was it?
- It went really, really well.
- I just want to say something
to you.
- To me?
- [crying] I'm sorry for saying
for you to grow up, because...
I know that you're just a kid,
and you deserve to be 25
and have fun and be stupid
and flippant and crazy
and blow it out, because,
before you know it,
you're gonna be 40.
And I love you for who you are.
- [tearful chuckle]
- And everything you aren't.
I'm sorry.
- Don't cry.
Ah, give me a hug.
Mmm.
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry
I'm annoying sometimes.
- You're not, though.
You're not.
- I'm not sorry,
but I like you.
- [laughing] Shut up.
We really are sisters.
No matter how different we are,
as much as we probably
don't want to admit it,
we're a family.
[clapper snaps]
- Gorgeous.
- It's time to shoot our scenes
with RuPaul.
It's very exciting.
- Here we go.
First positions, please.
If you don't do it properly,
the dog's going to die.
- [laughs]
- Action.
[triumphant music]
When you hit your marks,
defiant.
- Not so fast, "Rude Paul."
- Yeah, get a load of us,
stupid-model of the world.
- Yeah, grandpa!
We're here to throw a wrench
in your plans.
Uhh!
[clang]
- Bitch, that wrench came
awful close to this face.
- [laughs]
Try not to hit RuPaul.
Action.
- You had no intention
of giving up your crown.
- You'd love to replace me,
wouldn't you?
Well, take a number
and stand in line!
- Uhh!
- And cut.
Slap her.
I didn't believe that
for a second.
[beep]
- Chad Michaels
is a little prissy.
- Ouch!
- But she takes direction well.
She's slapping you.
That's gotta hurt.
- Ohh! Oh!
Oh! Uhh...
Oh! Ooh!
- Beautiful!
- Uhh!
- I very much appreciate
Chad's efforts.
- Are you all right, darling?
- I love it.
- [laughing]
- Okay.
Which brings us along
to Sharon Needles.
- Uh-huh.
- Sell it to me.
- Whatever happened to,
"Everybody say love"?
[gasps]
[thud]
- Sharon, you should
probably go, "uhh," forward.
- Got it.
Whatever happened to,
"Everybody say love"?
[gasps]
Hyuh!
Ah! Ugh!
Agh!
- Everybody say love.
- Anyone who gets
the opportunity
to have RuPaul kick
the shit out of them
should consider themselves
a very lucky individual.
- Phi Phi O'Hara.
- Yes, sir.
- It's your turn to shine.
- This is my last time that
I can really impress Ru,
so I don't want to mess this up.
I wanna win this.
- Action.
- And you, my pretty?
- RuPaul, what happened
to that innocent kid
from the Brewster projects
with the pair of heels
and--and a dream?
- And cut.
Can we ratchet that back
just a few notches?
It was a little Dorothy,
<i>Wizard of Oz</i><span style="bodyStyle"> on crack.</i>
- [chuckles] Okay.
What happened to that
supermodel of the world?
Ohh! Aah! Ohh!
[groaning]
- Good girl, Phi Phi.
Let's do it one more time.
On your marks...
get set...
action!
- Well, take a number
and stand in line.
- Ohh!
This competition, it's like
graduating high school
and going to Yale.
- Ohh!
- It's taken 18 years
to get here,
and it's validation
and redemption.
- I looked up to you.
- I've never worked on
something this hard
in my entire life.
There's just been ups and downs.
I've made enemies.
I've made best friends
for a lifetime.
I just feel like I could
conquer anything now.
Anything.
- Sashay.
- Oww!
- Shante!
- Ohh!
To be here and be able
to share my story
and grow as an entertainer,
I'm just super happy.
And I wouldn't trade that
for the world.
- May the best glamazon win!
- I am America's next drag
superstar.
- [laughing]
- My name is Chad Michaels,
and I'm America's next drag
superstar.
- [laughing]
- Oh, no, you didn't.
I am America's next drag
superstar.
- [laughing]
[coughing]
- And cut.
It's a wrap.
So thank you, ladies.
Great job.
- Thank you, ladies.
- And RuPaul will be available
for actual beatings later.
[laughter]
- Guys, it's the last day!
- I'm gonna miss this place.
- Me too.
- It's the big day.
It's the last day here.
And someone's gonna be
crowned today.
- One of us is going to be
America's next drag superstar.
- Isn't that insane?
- How do you feel you did
on your video?
- I feel good about it.
- Consistently throughout
this entire challenge,
I felt like I did really well,
with the dancing and everything.
- I found the dancing
challenging.
Structured choreography
is just hard on me.
- From day one till now,
starring in Ru's new video,
<i>Glamazon,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
this has been
the journey of a lifetime.
- So how do you think
it's gonna feel
to be on the main stage
for the last time?
- It's gonna feel amazing.
- I'm nervous.
- I'm nervous too.
- I worked so hard, and...
to be told I'm not gonna win,
it would just kill me.
- I'm, like, seriously shaking.
Ah!
- You all right?
- Yeah.
- So who do you think
is lip-synching
for the win tonight, girls?
- Phi Phi O'Hara.
- Sharon Needles.
- Chad Michaels.
- One of you guys is correct.
[laughter]
- Only two will be lip-synching
for the crown.
And, oh, I hope
I'm one of them.
- [laughing]
- Hey, guys!
- Hi.
- Hey, Ru.
- Welcome to the main stage
of<i> RuPaul's Drag race.</i>
This evening is extra-special.
Because tonight,
it's just family.
Michelle Visage!
- Hot mama!
- [laughs]
- Our little girls have
all grown up.
- It makes me weep.
- Shake the dice
and steal the rice!
Hey, Santino.
- Whew! I want a taste
of that honey!
- Anytime, honey.
Now, are you ready to crown
a champion?
- He's crowning as we speak.
- [laughs]
- This week, our queens
were challenged
to star as rompin',
stompin' glamazons
in my new music video.
Tonight, they're ready to pummel
the runway one last time.
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win!
- Chad Michaels!
Wow.
- That's Donatella Michaels.
- Ver-sassy.
- My look is Versace-inspired,
but it's also a little bit of
Jane Fonda<i> Barbarella.</i>
It's a power costume.
- Who knew she was
a bondage queen?
- Ah.
- Strap it on, baby.
- Super hero.
Sharon Needles.
- Ah, oh, yes.
- I'm hungry for some calamari.
- Sharon Scissorhands.
- You're squiddin' me,
Michelle.
- I squid you not, girl.
- I am giving them straight up
Sharon Needles fierceness.
Fashion forward
to the dark side.
- I think she's opening a can
of worms, if you ask me.
- [laughs]
- Touch all of this octopussy,
honey.
[laughter]
Phi Phi O'Hara!
Ooh!
Leopard on the runway.
- Flintstones 2012.
- Yabba dabba do me.
- [laughs]
- I wanted to give that
Wilma Flintstone realness.
I'm feelin' sexy
and I'm showin' body.
I'm just having a great time.
- She's the side piece Fred was
knockin' boots with.
- [laughs]
Phi Phi Flintstone.
She's gonna make your bed rock.
Welcome, ladies.
My top three girls.
Let's begin by watching
the world television premiere
of your acting scene.
[thunder crashing]
[electronic blooping]
Now that I've perfected my super
size queen glamazon spray,
my sinister plan for world
domination is nearly complete!
[laughing]
Ohh.
- Not so fast, "Rude Paul"!
[dramatic music]
- Get a load of us,
stupid-model of the world.
- Yeah, grandpa!
We're here to throw a wrench
in your plans!
Uhh!
- Nice try, ladies.
But you lose.
Again.
[clang]
- You promised to make me
a panther on the runway!
But all you did was lock me up
in that smelly old workroom.
You had no intention of
giving up your crown.
- You'd love to replace me,
wouldn't you?
Well, take a number
and stand in line.
- Uhh!
Ohh!
Uhh!
Oh! Agh! Uhh!
[whimpers]
- You love to make me hit you.
- [whimpers]
- All I ever wanted to do was
to be a female phenomenon.
I looked up to you.
We all looked up to you.
Whatever happened to,
"Everybody say love"?
- Love. Ah, yes.
I was in love once.
It was the worst 20 minutes
of my life.
- [gasps]
Hyuh! Ah!
Uhh! Hyuh!
Ohh!
[groans]
- Everybody say love.
And you, my pretty?
- RuPaul, what happened to that
innocent kid from
the Brewster projects
who became a shining example
for dreamers everywhere?
What happened to that supermodel
of the world?
- You're right.
I am that supermodel
of the world.
- Ohh! Aah!
Oww! Oww! Uhh! Ahh!
- Now...sashay...
- Ohh!
- Shante!
- Ohh!
- Shante, shante, shante!
- Aah!
- My super size queen
glamazon spray
should take effect any moment.
First, you'll destroy the world.
Then you'll destroy each other.
[laughing]
May the best glamazon win.
[cackling]
[laughter]
- All right.
- Chad Michaels,
Phi Phi O'Hara,
Sharon Needles...
it's time for your performances
in the<i> Glamazon</i><span style="bodyStyle"> video.</i>
[upbeat music]
- [screaming]
- She's so bloody tall.
[laughter]
- Wow, beautiful.
- The one thing I can count on
Chad doing well is,
you do this thing where
everything has a flourish.
- It's all this, girl.
- Yes! Oh, my god!
I could watch you do that
forever!
- It's old-school.
- Don't ever stop doing that.
- I don't think I can,
'cause it's, like,
one of three tricks
that I have.
[laughter]
- Old-school or not,
it's really refreshing
to watch you.
- Oh! Ohh!
- You played well with Ru.
I thought you were
very convincing.
It was funny, and I actually
wish some of that
lightheartedness
and your sense of humor
would have been
in your monster stomping.
- Next up, Sharon Needles.
- I'm so glad that you came out
tonight
for the finale in your
California natural look.
- Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Yeah, this is succubus
ready to wear.
- I love your stomping monster.
Very campy.
- But the choreography
and the dancing,
it was a little rough.
It looked a little shaky
in parts.
- When dancing
isn't your thing,
you can either own it,
or you can really fail.
You gotta be ready for
any challenge, you know?
- All right, Phi Phi O'Hara.
- I'll start with your
runway look tonight,
because I love it.
- Oh, thank you.
- Your stomping, that was
probably
your weakest thing,
'cause it looked more like
you were doing a runway.
I just got like, "I'm cute,
I'm fierce, let me walk."
- But I think your dance moves
were very tight and on beat.
Your range of energy was really
unbelievable in that video.
- Thank you, Phi Phi.
While you
and the other girls untuck
in the Interior Illusions
lounge,
the judges and I
will deliberate.
All right, just between us
"goils," what do you think?
- Oh, Ru.
- This is it, and they all
represent
three different
factions of drag.
Phi Phi is the ingénue newcomer.
Chad, the professional diva.
And Sharon Needles,
the little monster.
They could all represent this
competition so brilliantly.
- This is a tough one, baby.
- Let's start with
Sharon Needles.
- Sharon needles was
an underdog.
She came out here looking like
Nosferatu on the first show.
- She won that challenge.
- I know she did,
because she did it fiercely.
- Sharon always came out here,
week after week,
with something
conceptual and creative.
And I think that sometimes
people are scared of things
that are unconventional.
- I like the goth,
but I feel like,
"Do you have to do it
all the time?"
I don't know if the entire world
is ready
for somebody to win
this competition
like a Sharon Needles.
- Well, listen,
Lady Gaga's done it.
- Sharon's even beyond
Lady Gaga, I think.
- All right, kids.
Chad Michaels.
- There is nobody more
qualified than Chad Michaels.
The bitch is a<i> professional.</i>
Her representing your show
would be executed perfectly.
- It's great that Chad probably
had those
Versace dresses
in her closet from
the early '90s.
- Yes, a little old-school,
but Chad grew up in a different
time period
where drag was
what Chad does.
- It's not so much
the age thing,
'cause Chad is ageless.
- Age ain't nothin'.
- It's about
evolving constantly
and looking at what's next
and what's new.
- Phi Phi O'Hara.
At one point,
I thought she was too green,
but, boy, has she grown,
faster than any other competitor
we have ever seen.
- And what she lacks
in experience,
she makes up for with drive.
- If you remember,
she's gotten some heat
for being too ambitious.
Do you think that's a bad thing?
- No, it probably is what's
driving her creativity.
You know, you see it in the way
that she's evolved.
- And I feel like with Phi Phi,
she's the new
generation of drag.
- Silence!
This ain't over...
till they lip-synch
for their lives.
Bring back my girls.
Welcome back, ladies.
The moment of truth is upon us.
Based on your performance
in the<i> Glamazon</i><span style="bodyStyle"> music video</i>
and your body of work
throughout this competition,
I've made some decisions.
Chad Michaels...
you are a seasoned queen.
But do you represent
the future of drag?
Phi Phi O'Hara,
my beautiful queen...
in this competition, no one
has ever grown so fast.
But are you fully prepared
for the responsibilities
that come with the crown?
Sharon Needles, you are
as charming as you are scary.
And you shake drag to its core.
But do you have the right stuff
to be America's next drag
superstar?
For the first time
in<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> history,</i>
we are breaking
all the rules.
- What?
- Chad, Sharon, Phi Phi.
The three of you
will lip-synch for your lives.
Three queens stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me
and prove to the world
that you are America's
next drag superstar.
- This is everything
I've worked for,
all coming to
a head in one moment,
and I'm gonna give it
all I've got.
- The time has come...
for you to lip-synch
for your life.
- It's just a tornado
of emotions.
But I've never been afraid
of an audience,
and I'm not gonna
start now.
- Good luck,
and don't fuck it up.
- I am giving them
a little bit of spook,
a little bit of laugh,
and a whole lot of diva action.
- I want to show the judges
that I'm a true entertainer.
I am America's next
drag superstar.
- This is my time
in the spotlight.
I'm feeling pretty powerful
right now.
- She's so bloody tall.
- Hoo hoo!
[cheers and applause]
[laughing]
- I love you bitches.
- Love you too.
- Brava! Brava!
Ladies...
I've made my decision.
- Chad Michaels...
Phi Phi O'Hara...
Sharon Needles...
The winner of
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race...</i>
America's next drag superstar...
is...
Going to be announced
next week...
On<i> RuPaul's Drag Race: Reunited.</i>
- Is this a joke?
- RuPaul, you crafty
little witch.
- And I want to hear from you,
the viewers.
Who should be America's next
drag superstar?
Should it be Chad Michaels?
Sharon Needles?
Or Phi Phi O'Hara?
Let your voice be heard.
Tweet your thoughts to
#dragrace.
Ladies, I'll see you and your
drag sisters next week,
where, together,
we will celebrate our new queen.
- No matter what, I'm still
gonna win that crown.
- This is uncharted territory.
This has never been done.
I don't know
what's gonna happen.
- Any one of us deserve
that crown.
Maybe me a little more.
- Now, remember,
if you can't love yourself,
how in the hell
you gonna love somebody else?
Can I get an amen up in here?
all: Amen!
- All right,
now let the music play.


<i>- Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>the one, the only...</i>
<i>RuPaul.</i>
<i>- This is the Glamazon edition</i>
<i>of</i><span style="bodyStyle"> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
<i>Stuffed and tucked with</i>
<i>everything you love and more.</i>
- There's a hole in my stomach!
<i>- Plus, never-before-seen</i>
<i>footage</i>
<i>from the you better work room.</i>
- Yes, I know how
to sop it up, girl!
<i>- Then it's celebrities</i>
<i>caught on tape,</i>
<i>with exclusive outtakes</i>
<i>from the judges' panel.</i>
- I felt like I was maybe
about to watch
some sort of an adult,
erotic film of sorts.
- Oh, dear.
- And watch out,
fashion police.
We're counting down the most
sickening fits and fashions
with the arresting Chanel,
Mariah, and Pandora Boxx.
- So don't go anywhere.
The Glamazon edition
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i>
is ready to let you have it,
Auntie.
Can I get an amen up in here?
Cameroon?
[weakly] Anybody?
Helloo?
- Are you making fun of me,
Michelle?
- Some drag queens
can be so touchy.
[slap]
- Welcome to the Glamazon
edition of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
Thanks to you, this season has
been the biggest drag ever.
Let's flash back and share
some extra-special footage
that no one's seen.
Take a look at the casting tapes
that tried to snatch
my attention,
including some familiar faces.
<i>- Oh, shit,</i>
<i>that's the wrong song!</i>
<i>- Can you believe I walk around</i>
<i>with no eyebrows, child?</i>
<i>- Gah! Eat it, bitch! Aah!</i>
<i>- Why do you want me?</i>
<i>Um...look at me.</i>
<i>- I split, my butt cheeks</i>
<i>hit the floor.</i>
<i>Who does that?</i>
<i>This bitch.</i>
<i>- Miss Phi Phi</i>
<i>does not like to lose.</i>
<i>- What is this? I don't even</i>
<i>know what this means.</i>
<i>Why am I even here today?</i>
<i>- You said you come in for Chad</i>
<i>Michaels in</i><span style="bodyStyle"> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
<i>- The first Latin</i>
<i>Puertorriquena that win!</i>
<i>- I...will...</i>
<i>take my Vaseline out.</i>
<i>- Oh, I see, so this is some</i>
<i>sort of free</i>
<i>public service announcement</i>
<i>for some drag queen.</i>
<i>You know what? I don't</i>
<i>have time for this shit.</i>
<i>- I will take my earrings off.</i>
<i>- I'm gonna do</i>
<i>whatever it takes.</i>
<i>- I don't give up.</i>
<i>- Get rid of the pretty</i>
<i>and knock a bitch out.</i>
<i>- The Princess.</i>
<i>Now, when you hear that name,</i>
<i>you're thinking, well,</i>
<i>she thinks pretty</i>
<i>damn highly of herself.</i>
<i>- My friend wanna be</i>
<i>on</i><span style="bodyStyle"> RuPaul's Drag Race</i>
<i>'cause she this friend name</i>
<i>Willam who's hella cool.</i>
<i>- I got charisma, uniqueness,</i>
<i>nerve, and talent.</i>
<i>And as far as I'm concerned,</i>
<i>I'm pretty sure that's what</i>
<i>you're looking for, Ru.</i>
<i>- I think that,</i>
<i>in this business,</i>
<i>we all should be sisters,</i>
<i>we all should be friends.</i>
<i>We're one of a kind,</i>
<i>so we all should have our backs</i>
<i>and support everybody, and</i>
<i>that's my philosophy on that.</i>
<i>- I'm gonna win of this</i>
<i>competition!</i>
<i>- Win the competition.</i>
<i>- I came to win.</i>
<i>- I'm a fucking Oscar-winner!</i>
<i>I'm out of here!</i>
<i>- Oh! Hi.</i>
<i>I didn't see you come in there.</i>
<i>Welcome to my home.</i>
<i>- This one's my favorite</i>
<i>that I made.</i>
<i>I actually just made it.</i>
<i>Pins on just like this.</i>
<i>- Hairpieces that I make.</i>
<i>I do big hair too, but you--oh.</i>
<i>It's coming apart</i>
<i>like Shangela hair,</i>
<i>something to do with this.</i>
<i>- This, believe it or not,</i>
<i>is a shower curtain.</i>
<i>And, believe me,</i>
<i>it has many, many uses.</i>
<i>- I made this little</i>
<i>piece right here.</i>
<i>This is from white party.</i>
<i>- I definitely see,</i>
<i>like, Britney Spears</i>
<i>wearing something like this.</i>
<i>- You'll see my Dolly Parton</i>
<i>hair over here.</i>
<i>- Well, here we have a drag</i>
<i>queen's best friend--sequins.</i>
<i>Oh, that just bounces off of my</i>
<i>face, and it's just making me</i>
<i>just so sickening.</i>
<i>- There's a hole in my stomach!</i>
<i>I'm a big fan of, like, punk</i>
<i>rock,</i>
<i>and I'm not talking, like,</i>
<i>Pat Benatar punk rock, honey.</i>
<i>I'm talking like Jane Wayne</i>
<i>County punk rock.</i>
<i>[glass shatters]</i>
<i>- I'll send her home, girl.</i>
<i>- You--</i>
<i>- I can lip-sync the shit</i>
<i>out of you, girl.</i>
<i>- I mean--oh...</i>
<i>- Girl.</i>
<i>- Well, that's because you do</i>
<i>songs that everyone knows.</i>
<i>- Uh-huh. Uh-huh.</i>
<i>- I love him more than</i>
<i>anything.</i>
<i>And I do really mean that,</i>
<i>baby.</i>
<i>- I love you too, sweetheart.</i>
<i>- Let's go on TV and be famous.</i>
<i>- I know.</i>
<i>Mm, mm.</i>
- 13 exceptional queens were
invited to join the race.
And when they received
the good news,
their reactions
were truly touching.
<i>[Thus Spake Zarathustra]</i>
<i>- Huh?</i>
<i>I made it?</i>
<i>What--what--like,</i>
<i>I'm on the show?</i>
<i>- Whoo!</i>
<i>- Aah! Ha!</i>
<i>- [laughing]</i>
<i>- [gasps]</i>
<i>- [laughing]</i>
<i>- Shut your mouth.</i>
<i>- Oh, my God!</i>
<i>This is it. This is it!</i>
<i>This is it!</i>
<i>- So I think you guys</i>
<i>should do this:</i>
<i>You guys should probably</i>
<i>fit me for the crown,</i>
<i>'cause I plan</i>
<i>on taking it home.</i>
<i>- It's gonna be an honor to be</i>
<i>a part of this part</i>
<i>of drag history.</i>
<i>- I'm so grateful, so,</i>
<i>so grateful to you guys.</i>
<i>- Whew! Oh, my God.</i>
<i>I'm going to be on fucking</i>
RuPaul's Drag Race.
<i>Season 4.</i>
<i>- So how does that</i>
<i>make you feel?</i>
<i>- Yay. Ooh,</i>
<i>my teeth look good too.</i>
- Once they arrived,
these girls wasted no time
doing what drag queens do best--
ki ki!
Now, I proudly present the world
premiere of...
<i>Shit My Girls Say.</i>
- The library is now open.
- No sale, no search, no shade.
- No shade.
- No shade.
- No shade, no tea.
- Work.
- No tea.
- No tea, no shade.
- No tea, no shade.
- Girl...
- No, but no shade, no tea.
- Ooh!
- Oww!
- The category is cheesecake.
- Cheesecake.
- Eat it!
- I will never be late
for dinner.
- Eat it!
- Bella!
- Are you upset because you
can't handle all this fishiness?
- Bitch, you are a fish!
- Gorgeous fish.
- Eat it. Eat it!
- I'm probably gonna get read
for Phil...for Phil...for Phil.
- Beat that wig!
- Beating the face, girl.
- Yeah, but not literally
beating my face.
- I am trying!
- A post-apocolake--apocolake.
A post-apocolake.
Apocolake.
That's all I--
that's how I say it.
- I love being a woman.
- I love pussy.
- Yes, who doesn't?
- They all assume that
I want to be a woman,
like, and I don't.
- You gotta find the inner diva.
- Lookin' fabulous!
- Work it, girl.
- Put some foam around that ass.
- When making your ass, always
draw the shape of Africa.
- This is gonna look a hot mess.
- Should I tuck?
- All you have to do is dip it
in some apple cider vinegar
and it tightens right back up.
[kiss]
- Daylight is no friend
of the dragoon.
- Dry those tears and powder
those cheekbones, okay?
- This is called
cutting a cheek.
- You know how much garbage
comes out of these
over-painted lips.
- Yes, ma'am!
- Girl, no.
- My moustache
is gonna start showing.
- People don't even know how
much of a man
it takes to be a drag queen.
- Where the fuck are my tits?
- If you have a cameltoe,
that's perfect.
- This season, with all
the backstage conflama--
that's "conflict" and "drama"--
we couldn't fit it all
into the series.
So let's start
with some sassy outtakes
from the You Better Work room.
- If we had to imitate
somebody in here,
- Okay, but Willam--
- I would do Willam.
- Willam, 'cause, you know--
[laughter]
- Hold on, hold on.
I'm actressing.
You can catch me
on<i> Sex and the City</i><span style="bodyStyle"> and--</i>
[laughter]
Extras for--
- Oh, my God!
- Any extra that they ever
needed a gay prostitute.
- Willam.
- And the category is?
- Oh, my God!
[laughs]
- People must just look at you
and be like,
"Oh, my God, Jujubee!"
- That's the Lane Bryant
Jujubee.
- She went to a buffet before
she entered the race.
- Wow.
- Really, bitch?
- She is a bitch.
I'm a bitch. You're a bitch.
What does "bitch" mean?
both: Being In Total
Control Of Herself.
- Bitch!
[laughter]
- Does anyone know any good
drag toasts for drinks?
- Here's to women,
women divine,
they bloom every month,
they bear every nine,
the only of God's creatures
this side of hell
that they could get juice from
a nut without cracking a shell.
- Oh!
- I got one too.
Here's to the girl
in the little brown shoes.
She'll eat your man
and drink your booze.
She'll eat your cherry
and drink your gin,
but thank God I got my deep
brown box my cherry came in.
- Cheers!
- Michelle,
you look fantastic.
- Thank--Sharon, thank you,
thank you.
- Say, you know,
the thing about me and RuPaul--
when we go down to a gay bar,
we both get mistaken
for drag queens.
[laughter]
I don't know!
It's crazy.
It's crazy.
It's just me.
- You know what,
Cher, I like you,
and I'm gonna tell you why.
- Tell me.
- You don't give a fuck.
- I don't give a rat's ass.
- And that's what I like
about you.
- I don't give a rat's ass.
You know, I'm every
gay man's best friend.
And that's a lot of holes
to fill.
- [laughs]
Now, I created
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
to elevate the art of drag.
But I know you all love it
when these bitches get shady.
Roll the tape.
- Y'all got enough sewing
machines over there?
Y'all look like a sweatshop.
- Jiggly too--she talkin'
about she saw this thing.
- Who?
- Her.
- This bitch is shady.
- That smelly bitch,
she got nerve.
- Who, me?
- Yeah, you, you monster.
- Me? I'm monster?
- Yeah, you.
- Who's the big one in here?
- Girl, you look like a horse.
- Roar.
- You look like a horse.
- You wanna call me a horse,
honey, that's fine.
Horses have gorgeous legs,
and these legs will kick.
- You look like you've been
kicking, all right--
kicking flour.
Put some lotion on them
ashy-ass knees.
- Bitch, bye, boo!
- You ugly,
and I'm at peace with it.
[laughter]
- Willam's school for bitches
is now opening,
accepting enrollments
for the 2011--
- I already graduated.
- Nurse. Like, "Oh, nurse."
- Nurse.
- Yeah, 'cause she needs help.
And nurses help people.
Nurse.
- Did this bitch really
just come for me?
- Ooh, nurse!
- All that venom inside you,
mama.
We need to do an extraction.
- Out of me?
- Yeah.
- You think I'm evil?
- Didn't Sharon look pretty
yesterday?
- What?
- Sharon. I was shocked.
- [laughs]
- Don't think about it.
What makes you happy? Food?
Food makes you happy, right?
- I know you have low
self-esteem,
so I'll let you think you won.
- Thank you.
- Your attitude sucks.
It sucks, and you suck.
- I can't hear you.
- What did you read me about
now, you bitch?
- Girl, you're so insecure.
Nobody was even
talking about you.
Paint your face.
- You're such a rude bitch,
Phi Phi.
- Oh, well.
You might not have to deal
with it for long.
- [chuckling]
- Just like<i> Glee,</i>
there's something
about<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i>
that makes a queen just
break out in song.
- I'm Latrice!
- Cover girl!
Why your base look like chalk?
[all howling with laughter]
You can't walk!
- You better do it, bitch!
- Walk.
Don't walk.
Walk!
- She is so stupid.
- Don't walk!
[laughter]
[claps]
- [laughs]
- There you go!
- Did she just say "A biscuit"?
- Yeah.
- What's that mean,
"Jesus is a biscuit"?
- Let him sop you up.
- Sop you up?
- Sop up stuff with a biscuit.
- You do?
- Y'all so white
and Anglo-Saxon and shit.
Y'all never heard of
sopping it up with a biscuit?
- No.
- No, seriously, what's sop up?
- Sopping it up means you, like,
take your syrup
and your biscuit or whatever,
and you sop it up.
- Yeah, I do eat that.
- You know about sopping it up--
- Oh, you take
the biscuit after--
when it's on your plate,
and you go...
- That's soppin' it up!
- That's soppin' it--
yes, I know how to sop it up,
girl!
- Now, a lot of what happens
during filming
is just too hot to air, so label
these next clips N.S.F.W.--
Not safe for the workroom.
- There's a bunch of booties
back here.
- Mama, somebody left, like,
a dirty Kotex in my station.
- Aah! I think Phi Phi
might be in heat.
- Guys, my butt hurts.
- [trilling]
- If you fart, bitch, I swear.
'cause you's a gassy ho.
- [laughing] I can't.
- You never know which end
it's gonna come out of.
- [burps]
- Rick Santorum is,
if you google his name,
there is a filthy, filthy
definition that comes up,
because a gay man
was smart enough to make it
an urban dictionary word
or something.
And he hates gay people.
So I'm glad that
it's called that.
- Oh...my God.
I did not know all this.
- The queens just love to sit
around the table
debating hot topics.
It's like<i> The View,</i>
only more ladylike.
Hey, Miss Hasselbeck,
no tea, no shade.
Word up, girl.
- What president do you think
or have you found to be
the best or good-looking?
You know, like, the hottest
president we've had?
- Oh, my Mr. Obama.
- You think he's hot?
- Absolutely, he's so handsome.
- You do him? Yeah?
- Absolutely, and then I think--
- Bill Clinton.
- Bill Clinton.
- That's who I got my vote.
- Eww.
- When he first started,
he was hot.
- But President Obama, he's--
I've always thought he was just
so handsome and so charismatic.
- Lincoln was kind of cute.
He was really, really--
he was really tall and--
- In like a woodsman
kind of way.
- Yeah, and he wore, like,
a steampunk's top hat.
He looked really punk.
- Didn't George Washington
wear wigs?
- He did.
- So he could
double our collection.
- And Taft, if you're
a chubby chaser.
He was all right.
He's the one that got stuck
in the tub.
- Huh.
- Wow.
- Doing what?
- The one thing I didn't get is,
what is with the wig wars
when drag queens snatch off
their wigs during a lip-sync?
- Well, I mean--
- Like, you took off
a sequined dress,
and your wig stayed on.
And then, all of a sudden,
she just pulls her off.
- Well, you know, I felt like
you're in the moment,
and that song has so much
angst going on in it,
and I literally couldn't, like,
the hair was in my face.
- Well, that's one thing.
- So I was like,
"I gotta get rid of this hair,
so they can see my lips."
- But why did she
pull off her wig?
- It just--y'all,
they got down, girl.
They got down.
- It's lip sync for your life.
You know?
- If the wig falls off,
it falls off,
but I am not personally
taking that bitch off.
- It's all staying on, bitch,
when I do it.
- All those pins in there--
bitch, I had, like,
40 pins in my head.
- That's a desperate cry
for attention.
- A little<i> I Am What I am,</i>
<i>La Cage.</i>
- You know? Yeah.
But it's, like, unnecessary.
I understand you're born
this way, but...
- Right.
- Yeah, right now, you gotta be
a woman and stay a woman.
And you're killing my illusion.
- Where do you stand on these
very important issues?
Tweet your thoughts

and I will retweet my favorites.
Welcome back to the Glamazon
edition of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
It's time to flashback to the
queens' most memorable moments.
All right, boys.
Let me see what you got.
Now the first queen to leave us
was Shangela Laquifa Wadley.
- Hallelu!
I'm back, bitches.
[group groans]
Hallelu is in the building.
- After trying to crash
the party one more time,
I had her removed
from the competition...
[cheering]
And sent some place where
they'd really appreciate
her style and humor.
- [screaming]
- Let's just say
the zombies ate her up.
- Aah, hallelu!
Hallelu!
- Hello, how y'all doing?
- Alisa Summers experienced
quite a lot
in her short time here.
She braved exposure
to toxic waste.
- Do we get a barf bag?
- Aah!
- And a zombie attack.
But her post-apocalyptic runway
couture
didn't devastate our judges...
and Alisa Summers
did not survive.
Now, Lashauwn Beyond
was something unique
to this competition...
a shy drag queen.
- Hi, queen one.
- Hi.
- Now, her apocalyp--
her--her [indistinct]
- "Post-apocolake."
- Her couture was
out of this world.
But Lashauwn lacked nerve.
And it do take nerve.
What can't you believe?
- That I'm here.
- Bitch, you're here.
- Yeah, honey,
you better snap out of it.
But in week two, Lashauwn
was sent to the great beyond.
all: Whoa.
- Hi.
- The Princess,
a reserved extrovert,
struggled to let
her sparkle shine.
- [singing]
Do you feel like you've come
to the end of your road?
- After lackluster performances,
the judges felt The Princess
didn't have enough
zing in her Zen.
But she'll live forever
as Drag Race royalty.
- Hi, y'all.
- [screaming]
- What's the Spanish word
for roller coaster?
I bet Madame Laqueer knows,
because that was her ride
on Drag Race.
She won the wrestling
competition...
- Jiggly, get your butt
over here.
- [chuckles]
- But was always the last person
picked for teams.
- I wouldn't want to choose
Madame for my team
because I don't want her.
- She was team captain
for the sitcom challenge.
- [screams]
- But after a Razzie-worthy
performance,
Madame Laqueer
had to sashay away.
- Hey,
there's a new girl in town.
Let's get to business.
- Next stop, Paris, London,
Milan.
- Mahogany.
- This queen brought Broadway
experience to the competition.
- That young man look pretty
mature enough
to handle a beaver on his own.
- Um, Milan.
You're kind of
playing this stuff out here.
Look at the person
that you're talking to.
- Sorry.
- Her fierce lip sync helped her
stay in the game.
But the third time
was not a charm.
And Milan was sent back
to Broadway.
- Hi.
- What's good, ladies?
- Next up,
Miss Jiggly Caliente.
- [singing]
- And yes,
you may call her Jiggly.
She started strong, by winning
the toxic photo shoot.
- Yeah!
[cheering]
- But her hoarding couture
put her up for elimination.
- I'm getting
my eyeballs assaulted.
- Her tough New York
attitude...
do you take the train and drive?
- Yes, mama,
I have to get to work.
- Jiggly will cut a bitch.
- Thank you.
- Soon gave way to self-doubt.
- What the hell
would I write about
how to eat a pound of chicken?
- Exactly, that's funny.
- Oh.
Damn.
- She fought hard
in the lip syncs.
But the third and final face off
was the last for this
plus-sized Barbie.
- Deuces.
[laughter]
- Willam's rare combination
of sexy and funny
made her the queen to beat.
- Ooh, a 26, damn.
We got some big girls.
I hope they don't have diabetes.
- Already a successful
working actor...
- You look really familiar, Ma.
- Me?
You must have a television.
- She never let us forget it.
- I was on<i> Boston Public</i>
with you.
I was the best friend
of Candace Kane when she died.
I died on<i> Nip/Tuck.</i>
<i>CSI: New York,</i>
<i>Women's Murder Club.</i>
- Is that Willam
dropping names over there?
- Her acting experience served
her well in the challenges...
- Willam, you're funny.
- Thank you, hire me.
[laughter]
And so did her sickening body.
- I hope that lotion's
waterproof.
- But when I discovered
that off-screen,
Willam had violated show rules,
I had no choice but to give
this sexy drag queen
the heave-ho.
Willam, it has come to my
attention
that you have broken the rules.
Willam, I have to ask you
to leave the competition
immediately.
Now, sashay away.
- Category is...
all: Cheesecake!
- Our next queen was a tasty
slice of cheesecake.
Dida Ritz.
[cheering]
-<i> Bonjour,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> ladies.</i>
- Feisty and lovable...
- How you doing?
- How you doing?
- It's nice to see you again.
- Dida won fans on the runway.
- Supermodel.
- The judges lived for her long
legs and catwalk stomping,
but felt her fashion sense
was a bit pedestrian.
- Outfit-wise, I wasn't moved
one way or the other.
- My name is Dida Ritz,
I'm here representing--
or running for Wig Party.
- Her presidential debate did
not win her any supporters...
- I thought you were
the weakest debater.
- And she was voted
off the show.
But had there been
a wig-whipping challenge,
Dida may just have gone
all the way.
- Hi, girls.
[cheering]
- Little Kenya Michaels
was a tiny queen
who posed a big threat
to the other girls.
- [laughs]
- She's cute.
- Fuck.
- Kenya was a spicy firebird
on the runway...
- Bella!
- And in the wrestling ring.
- Praise God!
[indistinct yelling]
- What did you just do?
- In the snatch game,
we weren't<i> Crazy In Love</i>
with her Beyonce impression.
Oh!
And Kenya was sent packing.
[kisses]
- Ay!
[cheering]
- But the judges felt Kenya
had more to offer,
and invited her back.
But when her makeover of a dad
turned into a dud...
- Being pregnant's hard.
- Macabre too, apparently.
- Yeah.
- It was<i> hasta la vista</i>
for this sexy senorita.
[kisses]
[cheering]
- Ow!
Eat it!
- Sit back, relax, and pour
yourself an ice cold glass
of miss Latrice Royale.
- The shade,
the shade of it all.
- Her curves and swerves had the
judges captivated,
and so did her body slams.
- Aah!
- Mmm.
Well, hello, gorgeous.
- As Large Marge, she killed it
in the sitcom challenge.
- Get those nuts
away from my face.
- Her full-bodied grace
and soul made her a contender
to win it all.
But when her canine couture
went to the dogs,
Latrice was sent home.
- I am Latrice Royale.
- Bitches better beware.
- Royale!
[applause]
- All my queens
are sickening, no?
But which one is your favorite?
Go to newnownext.com
and vote for Miss Congeniality.
Do it for your lips.
Welcome back to the Glamazon
edition of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
The best seat in town
is the judges' table.
With my best squirrel friend,
Michelle Visage,
and my Judge Judys,
Santino Rice and Billy "V"
by my side--
well, things can get
a little bit stupid.
- If you do the research,
you won't have those
deer-in-headlights moments.
It's all the help.
- Did you just call her
the help?
- No, I said I'm here to help.
So I called myself the help.
- I see.
- It's okay because
I called myself the help,
and I am a black man...
dressed as a white woman.
- Yes.
- Sound familiar?
- Mm-hmm.
[laughter]
- I did think of<i> Grey Gardens,</i>
that smell of cat piss.
- I thought that was me, so--
[laughter]
- When I look at you, it almost
looks like an<i> Austin Powers</i>
kind of joke or something.
If clothes looked like a couch,
or an ottoman, or a loveseat,
you just wanna stay away
from it, you know?
[barking]
- What did you just call me?
- And no matter where I am
in this studio,
I can hear her laughs.
And it's just the most beautiful
thing I've ever heard.
- [laughing]
- Every time she laughs,
her nuts get bigger.
- This season,
the judges' panel
was more star-studded than ever.
They were looking good
and feeling gorgeous.
- With the tattoos,
I felt like I was maybe about
to watch some sort of an adult,
erotic film of sorts...
- Oh, dear.
- Which, not opposed to at all.
- Hello.
Well, welcome to the jungle.
-<i> America's got talent</i>
has nothing on this show.
- She looks like Divine Brown,
but we're trying to excite
America, not Hugh Grant.
- She was going for
<i>Sex and the City,</i>
and it was more like
"Sex in the Alley."
- Well, I'm not gonna
turn that down either.
- I really want a drag name.
- Jennifer Love Hewitt
is the best drag name
I have ever heard.
I'm changing my name
to RuPaul Love Hewitt.
- [laughs]
[thunder]
- The judges provided the queens
with constructive criticism,
but I swear, some of them was
jealous of they boogie.
- I appreciate those
hair and pants.
- You can have them
when I'm done.
- Okay, girl. They're mine.
- They're yours.
- 'Cause I love them.
- May I borrow
that hairpiece you had?
- The red one?
- Yes.
- I would like to borrow
your dress.
- You can have it.
- From your neck up,
I would decapitate you
and wear your head.
And I'm living for that ring.
- This is actually a broach.
I just threw a ring on it.
- Bitch.
- And PS, fuck you for having
the most amazing body ever.
- Your body is possibly
the sickest I've ever seen
on a queen in any season.
It's the legs, then she
turns around, it's the ass,
and that face--
my God.
- Your legs are really
something major,
and that is amazing.
- How dare they have better
legs than me?
How very dare they?
- Now, the celebrities weren't
just here to look fierce.
Once I scanned
their library cards,
those bitches
were ready to read.
- If we were gonna
go out on the town,
I'd pull you aside and say,
"Let's go look in your closet
closet and find something else."
- The wig looked like a litter
of kittens had sucked on it,
and she found it in the garbage.
- I would love to have
a cocktail with you.
Whether or not I would
get up to use the bathroom
and never come back,
I don't know.
[laughter]
- Is that a pot scrubber
on your head,
or are you just happy to see me?
- I was wondering,
after I painted my room,
where the drop cloth went.
- Yeah, there it is, right.
- That's where it was.
- Last night, my leftovers were
in the shape of aluminum foil
with a swan, you know?
- Mm-hmm.
- And somebody
put your leftovers
in the shape of Jiggly.
- [laughs]
- You know, that was a little
Jonbenet Ramsey.
That was a little creepy for me.
- You know, before,
I had a problem
with the makeup
every single time.
Today was the best
that it's been.
- Now, is that a read?
- A little bit.
- Uh-huh.
The celebrities also revealed
plenty of personal information
that we tastefully chose not
to include in the show...
until now.
I need more energy on the panel.
So I need about five hamsters.
Are there any in the building?
- Including her tits.
- [laughs]
- All right, Wy.
Winner of the challenge?
- This is very hard for me.
I feel like they should all
win something.
I'd rather go to the
gynecologist than do this.
- I'm gonna go
to the gynecologist
with you after this.
- I like a pap smear.
Count me in.
- I love ex-cons, but that's
a whole nother show.
- I've gotten in trouble
with a couple of those.
- I think it cheapens
you a little bit,
like a hooker in the Bronx.
- They're expensive.
- Oh. Oh, are they?
John said they're expensive.
- I have seen larger queens
turn it out.
- Yes, miss perky.
- Are you talking about
my chest?
- You've been talking about it
all day, you're so cute.
Go forward.
- I want her fondle me.
- I'll fondle you.
- There you go.
- Phone call for RuPaul?
Okay, yeah, all right.
Obama's calling me
real quick, hold on.
Somebody said you'd bumped your
head earlier.
How is your head?
- Haven't had
any complaints yet.
[laughter]
Welcome back to the Glamazon
edition of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
Now, this season the runway was
a fashion phenomenon.
And to help me rate
the ra sha sha,
I've invited back
queens from all seasons.
Welcome the sensational Chanel,
that funny fox Pandora Boxx,
and last, but not least,
we call this queen Mariah.
Hello, ladies.
- Hello.
- Hi, Ru.
- Are you ready to countdown
the top ten most sickening
fits and fashions of the runway?
- Uh, my tuck is on fire.
- Literally.
- Yes.
- Let's go.
Coming in at number ten,
Milan serving disco harem chic.
Burn, baby, burn.
- T.G.I.F.
She came out like
that was her last dance.
- [laughs]
- When she was dancing around,
it definitely took some flight
with the air into it.
It was hot, love it.
- Yes, is it something
you would wear?
- No, but I liked it, yeah.
- No? [laughs]
At number nine,
it's Jiggly Caliente
working her '80s retro look.
- Grey Jell-O never looked
so good.
[laughter]
There was the Missy Elliot
video where they, like,
pumped her full of air.
- Right, right.
- Sickening, and that gave me,
very much, that sort of feel.
I live for Jiggly.
I think she's amazing.
In the number eight spot,
it's Latrice Royale
in royal blue.
Ooh, now I love that dress.
I love the color of that blue
with the color of her skin.
And was living for
an asymmetrical silhouette.
- True, true goddess.
Voluptuous, beautiful.
I love that her eye shadow
matched the gown.
She wore it impeccably.
- I just can't believe
how beautiful
Michael Clarke Duncan
looks...gorgeous.
- He's done really well
for himself.
- He really has.
- Yes, he has.
At number seven,
Phi Phi O'Hara,
survivor of the RuPocalypse.
Very [indistinct].
- It was like<i> Waterworld</i>
meets, like,
<i>Xena: Warrior Princess.</i>
And I loved that when she
walked,
it was very much, like,
"I know I'm the shit.
It's cool."
- Bushmeat
never looked so good.
- [laughs]
- I live for the attitude,
the confidence, the silhouette.
It had a purpose.
And she executed it very well.
- You didn't think it was
a little too roadkill?
- It gave me beaver
on the side of the road.
But, you know,
who doesn't love a good beaver?
- That's true.
- Especially
on the side of the road.
- You're absolutely right.
Number six, Dida Ritz...
serving gold and gams.
Very Fritz Lang<i> Metropolis.</i>
- The Walmart version.
I wouldn't personally wear it,
because I'm not that cheeky.
With her skin tone,
gold is absolutely amazing.
Her having legs for days,
she can really pull off
a look like that.
- Coming in at number five,
Chad Michaels'
renaissance realness.
Lady Chatterley.
- Gorgeous,
the dog days are gone.
- I think she was Joan Of Arc
in her former life.
- [laughs]
At number four,
little Kenya Michaels
is pretty in pink.
Oh, look at her.
- If Nicki had a my size Barbie,
that would be her.
- [laughs]
- Definitely.
- She's so adorable.
She's just, like, a little doll.
I wanna pick her up
and squeeze her till she pees.
- [laughs]
- I still have to question if
everything is down there still.
She is true, true Walmart fish.
She really is.
- [laughs]
At number three,
it's Sharon Needles,
serving drastic plastic chic.
- What drag queen does not love
a good battery acid
chemical peel?
- I love the "Madonna two weeks
before the Super Bowl" look.
- [laughs]
- Sharon has such
an incredible ability
to me to take something so odd
and make it so chic
and ugly-beautiful.
- The number two fits in fashion
is Willam's tummy troubles.
- [vomiting]
- I say, "Bitch, that's what you
get for eating solid food."
- Agreed.
- It's obvious somebody still
has their gag reflex.
She's giving blonde trash
everywhere a bad name.
- [laughs]
- Tara Reid
would be proud though.
- Tara Reid would be proud.
- You're absolutely right
about that.
- And now, if I may, Ru,
the number one most sickening
fits and fashion belongs to--
oh, you know, it's not just one.
It's 11 timeless looks.
- I think I know
where this is going.
- And the winner is...
RuPaul!
Roll tape.
[growling]
Oops, uh-oh,
I think I just got fired.
Roll the other tape.
- Chanel,
which one of my outfits
was your favorite?
- I have to say with the
feathers--the blue feathers.
Like, May West had
a RuPaul drag baby.
- I, of course,
love absolutely all of them.
- Yes, that goes with saying.
- It's a toss-up between
the best little Ruhouse
in Texas look.
- Yes, yes.
- Or the very flowing, like,
Barbie meets Mrs. Roper look.
- Yes, yes, I love that.
- Gorgeous.
- Gorgeous, gorgeous.
I'm not gonna
leave you out, Mariah.
- I have to pick
the emerald green.
I wanted to
ease on down the road,
and snatch it right out
of your closet.
- Oh, my goodness.
I'd give it you, but I just
don't want to see it on eBay.
[laughter]
All right,
just between us girls,
who do you think should be
crowned
America's next drag superstar?
Chanel?
- Chad Michaels.
He's so seasoned.
And he's so professional.
And he's a perfectionist
in every single thing he does.
- Pandora?
- I would really love to see
Sharon Needles take the title.
Because I think
she's so different
than any of the previous winners
that she would really
just take it to a whole,
different, crazy, spooky level.
And I love it.
- Mariah?
- My pick has to be
Phi Phi O'Hara.
She's definitely hungry.
She has the fire.
The attitude is channeled
the right way.
She can just sear
right through the competition.
- Well, ladies,
you'll have to wait
just like everyone else
to find out
who's crowned America's
next drag superstar.
Now, before you go,
there's a little thank you gift
under your seat.
- [gasps]
Look it.
- It's<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
Iron Fist shoes.
- It's a petite size 12,
just like me.
- I just want
to make love to it.
- I love that.
- Cute little kitten heel
to go play around in.
- [meows]
- Strap on some attitude, girls.
Welcome back to the Glamazon
edition of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
Next week,
it's attack of the Glamazons,
as Chad Michaels,
Phi Phi O'Hara,
and Sharon Needles
battle it out
for the title of America's
next drag superstar,
and walk away with a lifetime
supply of NYX cosmetics,
and a one of a kind trip
courtesy of alandchuck.travel,
headline Logo's<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> tour,</i>
featuring cocktails
perfected by Absolut,
and a cash prize of $100,000
in the over-the-top extravaganza
that you won't want to miss.
The time has come for us to take
an up and close personal look
at the final three.
- Well, hello, hello.
all: Hi.
- How are y'all doing?
- A Chicago showgirl,
Phi Phi O'Hara is a feisty
firecracker...
- Don't be jealous of my boogie.
With the will to win...
- I want to look like a hot
Miami piece of ass.
- You look like it to me.
- Good.
- Hungry and ambitious...
- You're damn right I'm hungry.
You all should be hungry.
- She always brings
her A game.
- If the final say-so happened
today, you would win.
- Oh, hell no!
- Phi phi fierce
ruled the wrestling ring.
[cheering]
- Now, I'm gonna show you how
to really beat a mug, bitch.
- And her fighting spirit
caused a few rumbles
in the workroom as well.
- At least I am
a showgirl, bitch.
Go back to Party City,
where you belong.
But Phi Phi also revealed
a softer side.
- I wish I had a dad
like him to accept me
for everything that I am.
- Do you think your father
will watch this show?
- Probably not.
And that's okay.
I'm fine with that.
I hope he values...
like, who I am.
I'm a good person.
- I really want you
to have my phone call.
I really wanted to win it
for you.
- Honey, thank you so much.
- Yeah.
- Phi Phi O'Hara has a magic
combination of talent,
beauty, and ambition.
But, is it enough
to take her to the very top?
- Morning, bitches.
- What's up?
- Hi, everybody.
- Let's turn back time
on Miss Chad Michaels.
A world-class Cher impersonator.
- Cher comes to her for tips.
- This is one of many natural
hair colors
that I'll be wearing tonight.
[laughter]
I'm Cher, bitch.
- Throughout the competition...
- You want some of this?
We got plenty for you too.
- This dark lady has proven...
- Oh, oh, drop it like it's hot.
- That she's much more
than a gypsy.
- I am from California.
More specifically, the Shady
Acres Trailer Park on Doheny
between Weho and Beverly Hills.
- Tramp...
- What a jerk.
- And a thief.
- What made you think that
we could get away with
sneaking into a nut farm
in the middle of the night?
- Having accomplished
so much in her career,
will the next feather
in this half-breed's headdress
be the title of America's
next drag superstar?
[cheering]
- Sharon Needles arrived
as the freaky underdog.
- I look spooky,
but I'm really not.
- And her spooky-drag persona
set her apart from the start.
- Oh, she's bleeding.
- Goodness.
- Somebody call a dentist.
- She didn't hit off
with the other girls initially.
- I think a lot of the girls
here think I'm a one-trick pony.
You know, I'm just a spook,
monster girl.
- Just put some white powder
on your face and look gothic.
That's all we need you to do.
- But Sharon soon won over the
judges with her edgy aesthetic.
- I didn't even get the name
right away.
- All in the past, Miss Cole.
- Okay?
You know, so I'm right there
with you, but anyway.
- All right, well, yes.
- But she was plagued
by nagging guilt
over her boyfriend back home.
- She's auditioned
all four years,
and then I try out one time
and, you know, here I am.
I feel guilty about it
all the time.
- But Sharon rose above
and kept on winning.
- Condragulations.
Condragulations.
Condragulations.
- Yes.
- You are the winner
of this challenge.
[applause]
She showed the judges
that she could diversify
her dark-sided drag.
But always stayed true
to her own unique style.
- You look like you
came out of Italian<i> Vogue.</i>
- Ooh.
- From spooky to unspookable,
does Sharon Needles
have the fright stuff
to be America's
next drag superstar?
The top three girls,
the best of the best.
So which of these amazing queens
has the charisma,
uniqueness,
nerve, and talent
to be America's
next drag superstar?
Let's consult the stars.
Tell us what the future holds,
Madame Visage.
- Chad Michaels.
Chad Michaels is a Pisces,
and fish always do well
in this competition.
I predict Chad Michaels will be
America's next drag superstar.
- Oh, spoil alert.
Well, what's the story
for the others?
- Sharon Needles is a Leo
with Scorpio rising
and panties dropping.
I see it now.
Sharon Needles
will win this competition.
- Wait a minute,
I thought you said
Chad Michaels was gonna win.
- What, you--what?
You don't question
Madame Visage, girl.
Hold the celestial phone.
Phi Phi O'Hara
is a double-jointed Virgo.
As see it as clear
as a Lucite hooker-heel.
Phi Phi O'Hara is the winner
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
- Don't quit your day job,
Madame Visage.
What you say about my boob job?
- Well, what is crystal clear
is this competition
has never been so close.
And, with a cash prize
of $100,000,
next week's final challenge
promises to be the most
pressure-filled
and surprising
in<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> history.</i>
You won't want to miss a moment.
Until next week...
if you can't love yourself,
how in the hell are you gonna
love somebody else?
Can I get an amen up in here?
- Amen.
- All right.
Let the music play.


- Previously on<i> </i>
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race...</i>
Ladies, the password is...
<i>Snatch Game.</i>
[cheers and applause]
I might not be the biggest
star here,
but I got the biggest
knockers, okay?
[guffaws]
- I just want to say to
Lady Gaga that I am the only
boss here.
- This was a real heavy
Diana Ross.
- [imitates fart]
- Oh, my goodness.
- I don't know why they book me
on these chickenshit gigs.
- Condragulations.
You are the winner of this
challenge.
[applause]
It's very important for you to
understand we're looking for
the top.
Bring your "A" game.
- I will.
- Milan, shante, you stay.
Kenya Michaels, sashay away.
[cheers and applause]
And tonight...
oh, oh, oh, oh.
The dolls get wet.
And wild.
Ohhh!
With extra-special guest judges
<i>NCIS</i><span style="bodyStyle"> star Pauley Perrette and</i>
Kelly Osbourne.
The winner of
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i>
will receive a lifetime supply
of NYX Cosmetics,
a one-of-a-kind trip courtesy of
alandchuck.travel, headline

Absolut Vodka, cocktails
perfected, and a cash prize of
$100,000.
And may the best woman win.
- I'm getting the hangers.
- Oh.
- We're back in the workroom
this morning, and Kenya's not
here anymore, and it's sad,
'cause my best friend's gone.
- "Phi phi, I love you.
Sisters forever."
all: Aww.
- You sent both of
the Puerto Rican girls home.
- I know.
- You ain't never gonna be
in<i> West Side Story</i><span style="bodyStyle"> again.</i>
[laughter]
Not even a touring production,
bitch.
- Oh, my gosh.
- Uh-uh.
- Bye, Kenya. I love you.
Uh! This hurts.
- Things got emotional
on the runway last week.
Today we've had a little time,
you know, to heal up, refocus.
I'm so, so happy that I won
the<i> Snatch Game.</i>
It was almost overshadowed by
how sad we were,
and it was hard
for me to celebrate, but I did
celebrate yesterday.
[laughter]
- I'll be honest.
I felt like my drag was
misunderstood.
Like, I'm so across the board.
I like to teeter-totter in the
boy world.
- I think teeter-tottering in
the boy world works when you're
super feminine.
It's hard for a drag queen to
teeter-totter in the boy world
while still being that drag.
- I have always had to deal
with people's perception of what
drag is, but I have to remain
true to myself.
I'm not gonna compromise.
- We know that you are
an accomplished actor.
Now, were those tears real,
Willam?
- Those were real, yeah.
I can cry on cue, but I wouldn't
have cried ugly like that.
- She was acting.
That was not real.
This bitch is faking it.
- My lashes were falling off.
- I didn't know Satan could
cry.
[alarm wails]
all: Ooh.
Here we go.
- Ooh, girl, you got shemail.
Greetings.
My name's RuPaul, and I'll be
your cruise director.
Come aboard.
We're expecting you...
to make waves.
Okay?
Big waves.
Holla!
'Cause sometimes to avoid being
stonewalled, a girl's got to
rock the boat.
all: What?
- I don't get it.
- Hello, hello, hello.
[together]
Good morning, Ru.
Hello, Ru.
- Now, you all have been working
so hard that I've decided to
give you a break.
A spring break.
[cheers and applause]
- Tramp stamps.
- Today's mini challenge is
your chance to soak in the sun
and let it all hang out
in an all-American wet T-shirt
contest.
- [howls]
[applause]
- Now, just outside is a thirsty
crowd of spring breakers.
Each of you needs to "wet" their
appetite, wearing a Glamazon
T-shirt and a pair of your new
bosom buddies...silicone
breastplates courtesy of
boobsforqueens.com.
And the queen that gets the
biggest reaction from the crowd
will win.
[cheers and applause]
Jelly.
- This is money in the bank.
I got this.
- You have 30 minutes to style
and stuff your T-shirts.
I'll see you outside.
Let's go.
- Boobs!
- Holy moly.
- Show me your tits.
- Playing girlyish and bouncy
and sexy is something really
foreign to me.
- What and what and where is
the body, baby?
- My look is, "God, I want to
"go to Miami, but I can only
afford Fort Lauderdale."
- Mama Chad looks like a MILF.
Chad, damn.
It's called Forever 21,
not Forever 41.
- Let's go to the beach.
[cheers and applause]
[whistle blows]
- Welcome to spring break at
Dragtona Beach.
[cheers and applause]
Are you ready to get wet
and wild?
First up, from The Big Apple,
London, Paris...Milan.
She's got two big apples.
Oh.
She not shy.
She is mopping the floor.
Chad Michaels.
Oh, oh, drop it like it's hot.
- My tits are big, my hair is
big, and my ass looks good.
I'm just feeling like
a drag cougar.
- It's Jiggly Caliente.
Her milkshake brings all the
boys to the yard.
Touch all of this, Jiggly.
Sharon Needles.
[laughs]
- I'm not one of those
fishy queens.
I never want to create a
character that someone would
want to fuck.
I like to mock sexiness.
[exclamations]
- She's a regular Danny Thomas
with that spit take.
Phi Phi O'Hara!
Uh-oh.
Oh, my goodness.
Oh, ouch, ouch, ouch.
- I was shaking my boobs, and
all of a sudden my boobs
came off.
- She's coming undone.
- And then they poured
the water,
and then all of a sudden,
my wig fell off,
and it was a mess.
- Phi Phi, do you have all your
body parts?
[laughter]
Willam, Hollywood honey.
Oh, squirt. Squirt it.
I hope that lotion's
waterproof.
- I feel amazing,
because I know I look great.
And I was serving 'em sex,
and I just soaked it up.
- Oh, my God, she's driving
the crowd crazy.
She's a dirty, dirty girl,
that Willam.
Everything tastes good on
a Dida Ritz.
She's soaking wet.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
Chocolate milk.
Put your hands together for
Latrice Royale.
You need some cooling down,
girl.
Oh!
- You know my alter ego is
a stripper.
I'm loving every bit of it.
- Give it up for
Latrice Royale.
Thank you, Latrice.
You were all wet and wild.
Damn!
One of y'all really worked
the crowd into a lather.
Can I get a drumroll?
[drumroll]
The titular winner of today's
mini challenge is...
Willam.
- Yeah!
- Yes.
- I won; you know, it's kind of
a hobby of mine.
Thank you, God,
for all this bod.
- Condragulations, Willam.
Spring break 2012!
Now that spring break is over,
it's time for a little
herstory lesson.
Back in 1969, at the Stonewall
riots, it was a drag queen who
had the charisma, uniqueness,
nerve, and talent to dig her
heels in and start a revolution.
And every year since, drag
queens have been the shining
stars of pride celebrations
around the world.
For this week's main challenge,
you'll be styling
a fashion-forward look for our
very own pride parade.
Now, the theme for this year's
pride is hope floats.
In addition to your outfits,
you'll need to design parade
floats using these colorful
accessories.
[laughter]
Ships ahoy.
Each of you will be assigned
a different boat based on the
eight colors of the original
rainbow flag.
Willam, you won the mini
challenge, so you get to assign
the color themes,
using these hankies.
- I want blue.
Indigo blue.
I think this is the fairest way
to do it.
- Jiggly gets orange.
Phi Phi gets violet.
Dida gets red.
Turquoise for Latrice.
Pink for Chad Michaels.
Yellow for Milan.
And green for Sharon needles.
Now, ladies, you can use your
own drag, plus materials
provided by Michael Levine
fabrics.
Your ensemble needs to be super
chic and take pride over the
rainbow and on to the runway.
Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best woman win.
- Yay.
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, look, shamrocks.
- This might buckle
my runway game.
- Your walk is your everything.
I don't know about that.
- Give it to me.
Give me Gautier
in a boat stripe.
- This is the ugliest color
ever.
- I love orange.
- It doesn't look good on me.
I went from baked potato to
sweet potato.
- Jiggly, what are you doing?
What is the concept of your
costume?
- As of right now,
I have no clue.
I'm not good at the creative
stuff.
This is the challenge where I
could sink to hell.
I want to incorporate this
somehow.
But then I just don't want it to
look like a Thanksgiving float.
And it's gonna look like
a turkey.
- Yeah, you don't want to look
like a turkey.
You don't want that to happen.
- Fuck, I'm screwed.
- Today our main challenge is,
we have to create
a Pride Parade float
with a matching outfit
in one of the colors
from the Pride flag.
- Originally, for the old
gay rainbow flag,
green stood for nature.
There's nothing natural
about me.
- You made a snake.
Are you doing a Garden of Eden
theme boat?
- Um, more like a Medusa.
Like, "Look at me, and I'll turn
you into Stonewall."
- Oh, yeah.
- So who here knows what
Stonewall is?
- Stonewall was in June of '69,
and the cops decided to go in
and cause some trouble.
- They were just, you know,
giving this one particular bar
all kinds of hell.
They just put their foot down.
They weren't gonna take it
anymore.
- I heard if you wore women's
clothing or makeup, they would
douse your head in the mop
buckets of nightclubs.
- Wow.
- You had to wear at least
three articles
of clothing that
were assigned to your genders
at all time,
or you could be arrested.
- I grew up in a religious
household, and that being gay
was just not something that
was accepted.
But this challenge does help me
rethink my perspective, because
it makes me very proud to know
that other queens have paved
the way.
- Chad, what was it like
to be there?
You were, what, 29 at the time?
[laughter]
- Okay.
I think for everybody to know
where we came from.
A legacy of drag deserves
to be carried on.
Me and Bob used to just
sit around for hours
and just glue sequins
onto dresses.
Bob's no stranger to a glue gun
in a pinch.
- That whole impersonating thing
you have to really do
your homework
to get every nuance,
ever characteristic.
- You do.
Celebrity impersonation
is my passion.
And it has been
from the beginning,
because when I started
in my show, the<i> Dreamgirls,</i>
it was all look-alikes
and all comedy,
and if you wanted to be
in the show,
you had to do
celebrity impersonations.
- Wow.
- I'm absolutely here
to be a role model.
This art doesn't have to die,
because it is dying.
There aren't very many people
like me anymore who do,
like, actual
"celebrity impersonation."
That's what I've done
for most of my career
is be a celebrity impersonator,
and I've loved it.
rock it out.
I've been, you know,
in the business a while.
I want to inspire the younger
generation of drag queens
to step up and do it right.
- [blowing]
[spits]
Fucking swallowed glitter.
- You've swallowed worse.
We're gonna have dinner soon.
Stop eating the glitter.
- Stupid-ass bitch.
- Goddamn it, Jiggly.
- Fuck you.
- Oh, my God.
I love my boat already.
I want to go on my boat so bad.
- You fucking cunt.
- [laughs]
I decide to do all-over pattern
of stars, or stickers, that have
my face on them.
The theme is hope floats, and
I've always hoped to be a star.
- That's you?
- Yes, it's me.
- You dirty bitch.
- Narcissistic much?
- Willam's boat was covered
in stickers of himself
and to me did not represent
Pride at all.
- How are you feeling
about this challenge?
- This is not something
that I normally do,
and I'm really--I'm trying
to focus on the boat first
and make sure I get
something down for that.
Trying to do what I can.
Sink or swim.
Sink or swim.
The most difficult thing
about the challenge for me is,
my brain goes in 20 million
different directions.
Sometimes being an artist
can be difficult.
- Here's your micro-dot, babe.
- Oh, shit.
I didn't realize that.
The clock was ticking,
and all I could think about was,
"Try to convey some type
of message on this float."
- Hello, hello, hello.
all: Hi, Ru.
- It looks like
a Kylie Minogue concert
exploded in here.
- [chuckles]
- Jiggly Caliente.
- Hello.
- May I call you Jiggly?
- Yes, you may.
- Oh, good.
What we're looking for is
fashion-forward.
You know,
the theme is hope floats.
What statement are you going
to make?
- I--the statement I want to
make is that, um...
dreams are possible.
- Huh.
Now, what are your plans to
decorate your boat?
- Um, I plan on adding the
trimmings, the fabrics, and then
I'm gonna add the flowers and
other knickknacks.
- Yeah.
- Ru is not buying my bullshit
at this.
I know it.
I can see it in her eyes.
- I don't want to worry you,
but you do seem a little bit
behind.
We're looking for an expression
of Jiggly.
- Definitely.
- All right.
Get back to work.
- Thank you.
- How am I gonna do this?
- Dida Ritz.
- Hi, Ru.
- So what are you gonna do?
- I'm going for a '70s
really hippie vibe.
Very love, peace, and harmony.
And my whole concept
is a jumpsuit.
- With a blouse.
- Maybe with a blouse,
maybe not.
I don't know yet.
- We're looking to see the best
Dida that there is.
We want fashion-forward,
you know?
- Mm-hmm.
- I'll see you out
on the parade route.
- Thank you, Ru.
- Good luck.
Hi, Chad.
- It's time for another edition
of Ru's Clues.
- [laughs]
What are you gonna do
to make sure that your boat
and your costume and everything
represents hope
and the future of gay pride?
- I really want it to be,
you know, cyber showgirl,
fashion-forward.
- Now, you're boat.
- My boat.
- You've got a lot
going on there.
You have netting around there.
- I have netting.
I'm capturing hearts and minds
with my net.
- Are you planning to edit
the boat at all?
- I feel like it's got
a really futuristic feel to it
with, you know--
- The metallic.
- The metallic and the square,
like,
faux sequin and all that.
- I can't wait to see it
on the runway.
- I'll be there.
- All right, Chad.
You get back to work,
Lady Chad-erly.
- All right, bye.
- Bye.
- Well, well, well, Willam.
- It's starship Willam.
- Wow.
- In your book you had a quote
that said,
"Even when I was down,
"I treated myself as
a star.
And eventually, the rest of
the world would catch up."
And I wrote that on my little
binder in eighth grade.
I've adopted that theory too.
I've always treated myself like
a star and just knew it was
gonna happen.
- We got on your case last week
about being more vulnerable, and
that story's very vulnerable.
And what do you plan on wearing
if anything?
- Do you remember that episode
of<i> Sex and the City</i>
where Carrie
fell down on the runway?
- Yes.
- Dolce &amp; Gabbana coat.
Oh, well, look who's got it.
- Is that the exact one?
- It's not the one she wore.
- I see.
- Because, you know, she's so
much bigger than me.
- [laughs]
I'm gonna let you get back
to work here.
Bye.
London, Paris, Milan.
- Hi, Ru.
- So tell me about this boat.
- My inspiration for this,
honestly, I mean, we're doing a
future thing, but I wanted to
try to do a flashback
to the future.
- A flashback to the future.
- Yes.
- But we're asking you to be
fashion-forward.
Now, you live in New York city,
the most fashionable city...
- I do.
- In the U.S.
Where do your costumes
come from?
- Um, usually I have people
make them for me.
- I see.
- 'Cause a lot of my costumes
are characters,
like the housewife or that looks
like the lady next-door.
- You don't want the audience
to know who you are.
You want them to see
a character.
But we want to know who you are.
- No, I definitely want them to
know who I am.
- Because you have lip-synched
twice.
- I have.
- Make that Milan come out.
- Okay.
- Get back to work.
- Thank you.
- All right.
Phi Phi O'Hara.
- Hi, Ru.
- How are ya?
- I'm good. How are you?
- Good.
So what are you working on?
- I have a one-armed catsuit
right now.
- Is that Uranus on...
- It is my-ranus.
- Okay.
- Yeah.
- The theme is hope floats.
I want to know about your
darkest hour and how you were
able to get over that.
- Well, as a kid, I had--I grew
up in a really abusive, like,
household.
And it wasn't a very good
childhood.
And it took 16 years for us to
figure it out, but we did.
<i>It feels good to leave all that</i>
<i>stuff back there.</i>
<i>Chicago's a fresh start for me.</i>
<i>I get to live the life that</i>
<i>I want to live.</i>
- So you've come a long way,
baby.
You've pulled yourself up out
of some really dark places.
This is your chance to shine.
I'm counting on you to pull
through.
- Okay.
- Okay, you've done it before.
You can do it again.
- I will.
- All right. Get to work.
- Yes.
- All right.
At ease.
- All right, ladies,
gather round.
Tomorrow on the main stage,
we'll be celebrating Pride with
our extra-special guest judges,
fashionista and TV star, my good
pal Kelly Osbourne will be here.
- Oh, my God.
Yay.
[cheers and applause]
- I love Kelly Osbourne.
Even to even get read by her,
I don't care.
It's an honor.
She's sickening.
- And a woman who's no stranger
to the navy.
From<i> NCIS,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> Pauley Perrette</i>
will be here.
- Oh, yes, ma'am.
[applause]
- Wow.
- How many times did you work
with her, Willam?
- Just once, so fuck off.
[laughter]
- Now, ladies, remember...it
ain't the size of your boat but
the motion in your ocean, okay?
- Okay.
- Good luck.
And don't fuck it up.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Okay. All right.
- See you later.
- Thanks, Ru.
- Bye.
- Arts and crafts day.
- Our challenge today is to make
fabulous fashion-forward
outfits and gay pride floats.
So with challenge,
you have to have a crafty eye,
and you have to be creative with
your float and your costume.
This competition
is really gonna show
who can keep up
with the big girls.
Fucking shit.
Fuck.
- I did it all wrong.
Fuck.
- Oh, my God.
Now I just fucked it up.
- But that's pretty.
Girl, you're gonna win.
- You can kiss my ass.
- [laughs]
- Ugh.
It is very hard to create an
outfit from scratch in a day and
decorate a boat.
It's damn near impossible.
My God, this making a boat crap
is just--is not the type of
dress...
all righty.
- You okay?
- No.
- She doesn't know her idea
for her boat.
- You have a bunch of stuff over
there,
and you have a lot
of good stuff too.
Open stuff up.
Look at the textures.
Look at all that stuff
and just play with it.
Jiggly's just out of her element
being on this competition.
She is so far behind, and it's
just like, "Girl, just get your
crap done."
- The hardest part about this
challenge is not telling
everybody else that I'm gonna
win.
- Wow, that is really cool.
- Yeah, I mean, it looks
egotistical,
but it's got a message,
like, "I'm gonna handle myself
like I'm gonna be
somebody someday."
- You're sickening, bitch.
You're sickening.
- Sickening?
More like absolutely disgusting.
- Really?
- Yeah, bitch.
- Thank you.
- So has anybody ever done,
like, pride performances or
pride shows?
- Bitch, I put my gay pride
time in, honey.
In my years.
- In Pittsburgh, they don't
ask me ever to do Pride.
I mean, maybe they just think
my act is reserved
for nighttime only.
- Maybe it's because she's
a spooky bitch.
- I like spotlights,
not sunlight.
- What was it like for you guys
in your hometowns
growing up being gay?
- I'm from Texas, so Texas is
not about the whole
being gay thing.
I remember, when I first went
out to the gay clubs, there was
a lot of, like, gay bashing,
and, like, guys would come by
with, like, baseball bats.
Like, moving to Chicago, I can
hold someone's hand walking down
the street or I can be
affectionate.
And In Texas, you can't do that.
- Damn.
- It's kind of hard
for me to talk about it.
I don't really like
where I come from.
I don't--it is not
a lot of good memories.
I was teased a lot
when I was young.
I hate talking about it,
'cause it makes me just pissed.
Like, the people that called me
a fat girl,
some of them still work--
no shade--
but still work at McDonald's,
still work at Burger King,
still living at home
with their parents,
ain't got a life.
Home is not a good memory
for me.
- Theresa,
I knew you grew up in Compton.
- Ugh.
- What was that like?
- You don't even think about
saying the world "gay"
or that you're gay.
It's straight-up hood there.
You know what I mean?
So I was threatened
and beat up and told
if I was ever--turned out gay,
I would get killed,
and it was rough.
So I just kept all that
to myself
until I was big enough
and bold enough
and grown enough to move.
And so I did, you know,
and...
- Is the New York drag
community all in Manhattan?
- The New York drag community
is sort of everywhere.
Definitely certain areas where
there's certain drags
you can see.
There's the singing girls,
there's the campy girls, there's
the grunge girls...
- So what are you?
Like, what's your...
- I'm a floater.
My style kind of bounces around.
<i>I don't want to be pigeonholed</i>
<i>as just a drag "queen."</i>
I think it's important for
people to see that there is
an artist on stage.
- I have dignity looks and
paycheck looks.
Dignity is when I will not bend
for anyone, and I don't care if
I make a dollar.
I'm doing what I'm doing.
- Right.
- And there's times the
electric's about to shut off,
so I dress up like Lady Gaga.
- Right.
[laughter]
- Jiggly, is that a men's shirt
or a women's shirt?
Your hanger strap is showing,
and I already know the answer.
- No, it's not.
- You cross-dresser!
We're supposed to be boys today,
and you're cross-dressing.
- Really, girl? Really?
Her slick-ass comments are gonna
drive me crazy.
- Shut up.
- You shut up.
- Ugly bitch.
- You shut your ugly boat
mouth.
- Oh, you have something to
say, bitch?
- Yeah, your boat's ugly.
- You narcissistic whore.
- Your boat's ugly.
- I don't care.
My boat could be ugly, bitch.
- But your face is ugly.
- Your boat don't float.
Your boat don't float.
- Come here and say that,
bitch, 'cause I will inject this
shit right in your cheeks,
ho.
- Ohh, don't talk to me like
Chad Michaels.
You know how passionate he is
about silicone work.
- [as Cher]
Shut up, stupid.
Willam runs his mouth a lot.
It's kind of like a spigot you
can't turn off.
And it started to get on my
nerves.
I'm Cher, bitch.
- You guys, you know what my
boat reminds me of?
- What?
- A winner.
[laughter]
- Selfish bitch,
learn your words.
You will be in the bottom two.
- Bitch.
[alarm goes off]
- Anchors aweigh, bitches.
- Cluck-cluck, ladies.
- So much to do.
- Let's get to work.
- I was having panic attacks
about this damn snake.
- The mood in the workroom
right now is intense.
Queens are hustling,
people gluing, going crazy.
It's insane right now
in the workroom.
- Does this look like a fucking
anchor yet?
I ended up with the final
concept for my boat last minute.
Now I just got to finish it.
Sharon?
- Yeah?
- Does this look like an anchor?
- It kind of looks like
a dick.
- It does look like a penis.
- What's the theme of your
boat?
- The whole, "It gets better,
love you for you,"
very Saint-Tropez.
Bright colors.
Very Saint-Tropez.
So I'm just, like,
scrambling for time.
- Jiggly's is still a mess.
She kept adding crap upon crap
on top of more crap, so it just
looked like a big pile of crap.
- I'm just gonna try to go for
obvious things--sunlight,
yellow, you know, happiness.
- Right.
- I'm gonna get a little grade
school at moments.
- There ain't gonna be nothing
about grade school on my boat.
My boat's gonna be an all-adult
function.
- If I would have made Milan's
boat, I wouldn't have put<i> </i>
<i>The Milan Invasion</i><span style="bodyStyle"> on it.</i>
I would have blamed it on
someone else.
Like, "I didn't do this boat.
No, this is her boat.
That girl's boat, not my boat."
- I'm looking around the room,
and I'm in drag, everybody else
is practically done and in drag,
and Jiggly's still stapling and
gluing stuff to her float, and
I'm like, "Hello, you only have,
"like, minutes left until you've
got to be in drag and on that
runway."
- It's sink or swim.
You better be ready,
and you better care.
- Jiggly is a hot mess.
Good luck, girl.
- Oh, shit.
Where the fuck are my tits?
- Welcome to the main stage of
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
Hey, guys.
- Hey, gorgeous.
- Hi.
- Michelle Visage, are you
proud of our girls?
- I am proud to be an American,
and I am proud of our girls.
- [laughs]
Billy B., are you ready to see
our girls?
- I am so ready.
- Kelly Osbourne.
- Hi, Ru.
- You've been grand marshal
of Gay Pride here in
Los Angeles.
- Yes, with my mama.
- Well, you'll feel right at
home here.
- I already do.
- Pauley Perrette,
welcome aboard.
- Thank you.
Happy to be here.
- I love a parade.
Don't you?
- Yes.
- This week our queens were
challenged to design Pride
floats.
Now they're ready to parade
them down the runway.
Are you ready to see their true
colors?
- Hell, yeah.
- Gentlemen, start your
engines,
and may the best woman win.
- Chad Michaels. Ahoy.
- Glamorous.
- She's showboating.
- My outfit is fashion-forward
showgirl--always beautiful,
always painted, nearly naked.
- Starbooty!
- She's serving the deadliest
catch...
- Snapper.
- Dida Ritz in red.
Oh, I love a harem pant.
- I'm serving float
coutureness.
I'm not letting this boat get
in my way.
I always leave my mark.
Honey, I pee on the runway.
Trust.
- Red sky at night,
sailors' delight.
Nice aft.
Up next, Jiggly Caliente in my
favorite color, orange.
- Tangerine dream.
- Yes.
- I look good.
My wrap is flowing.
My hair's flowing.
My makeup is right.
My lips look right.
I look sickening, bitch.
- Mm, it reminds me of
Orange Julius.
Or is it Lrange Jiggly-us.
Milan.
- Hello, sunshine.
- I'm feeling proud of what
I created.
My float is<i> The Milan Invasion.</i>
It's inspired by Fire Island.
- Boatload of wigs.
- It's nice to have extra wigs,
though.
- It is, 'cause, if you end up
on<i> Gilligan's Island</i><span style="bodyStyle"> and you</i>
want to do shows, well...
- Hello.
- Yeah.
- Ooh, Sharon Needles.
- She is from the
Garden of Eden.
- Does her snake have one eye
or two?
- I was really serving them
some snake realness.
I can strike at any time.
- Oh, oh, oh, oh.
I love!
- Latrice Royale in turquoise.
- The goddess of the sea.
- Wow.
Look at all that water.
- I just want it all to hang
out today.
I have this hair that I baked
and sculpted and hand-painted.
- Love those lips.
- She fell face-first at
Claire's.
- [laughs]
- Now that is a Poseidon
adventure.
- Willam.
Oh, dear.
She's a low rider.
- Check that out.
- Dropping anchor.
Land ho.
- Oh, my God.
Permission to come aboard.
- Ooh, girl, I'm dusted.
- My costume's right,
my body's right.
This challenge is right up my
lagoon.
- She's showing us her
starboard side.
Stick it in the porthole,
Willam.
- Phi Phi O'Hara.
- Like a float warrior.
- Ooh, love is a battleship.
- My look I'm channeling is
fashion-forward sci-fi.
I'm trying to give them
a bad-ass bitch.
- It's the Phi-Phi-tanic.
- She's going down with
the ship.
- Love it.
- Purple for passion.
My colorful queens,
I love a parade.
But now it's time
for the judges' critiques.
First up, Chad Michaels.
And what does your float say
about you?
- Obviously, with the stripes
on my costume
and the stripes on my boat,
I'm a drag cougar.
- [laughs]
- Rrargh.
I basically wanted to go with
classic showgirl,
but fashion-forward.
- Can you turn around so I can
see your butt, please?
That's my favorite part of your
whole costume.
I love it.
- Thank you.
- To me, it is traditionally
showgirl.
There's not something so fresh
and modern about it.
- Next up, Dida Ritz.
Wow, and your hair is all big
and everything.
- Take a little bit of advice
and put it to use.
- You have the cutest face.
So adorable.
- You do have a pretty face.
Sometimes I think that you might
rely on it too much.
What you have on,
it's not particularly an event.
You always seem sort of
pedestrian.
- Your boat, it looks a little
bit piñata-like.
You know, you want more.
It is a parade.
- Jiggly Caliente.
Tell us about your float.
- Right now, there's a lot of
gay youth being bulled.
I decided to use "Love you for
you."
I wanted to class it up a bit,
make it very Saint-Tropez.
'cause my outfit is really
a swimsuit.
- Oh, wow.
- Oh, yeah.
- Very Saint-Tropez.
- I'm really happy you took
your cape off.
I was dying to see what was
underneath there,
and it's adorable.
- It's the big reveal.
- You should have walked
the runway without the cape.
The boat, you said you wanted to
give it some class.
It's, like, sixth-grade class.
- Ugh.
- Next up, London, Paris,
Milan.
- Basically I wanted to
represent the history
of the
drag performance invasion on
Fire Island with the girls who
have long passed who have paved
the way for me to go forward in
the future.
And I named it<i> </i>
<i>The Milan Invasion,</i>
because it's me,
and I'm invading the world.
- I know all about Fire Island.
The thing is, the boat didn't
really read that.
It was hard to understand.
- You know, everyone else sort
of had a real message about
pride, and the biggest thing
about your boat is that you made
it about you.
It sort of offended me.
- Sharon Needles.
You've got a little snake story
line going on there, don't you?
- The original green color in
the rainbow flag stood for
nature.
- Yeah.
- 'Cause all gays were hippies
in the '70s.
[laughter]
I used the snake because they're
feared for the wrong reasons.
And I've always been feared for
the wrong reasons.
- I'm so into your hand snake.
- My hand works great on
a snake.
- I think you look beautiful.
Your boat on the other hand
looks like it sank a few years
ago and it's covered in moss.
It sort of lost boat to me.
It just became this big green
thing.
- All right, next up,
Latrice Royale.
Lady turqu-ahh.
- I love anything that
sparkles, and you sparkle from
head to toe, and I love it.
- My lips are gonna crack.
- Tonight you're giving us
Nefertiti meets Ursula
the sea witch.
- Yes!
- I'm gonna challenge you on
one thing, Latrice.
- Tell me.
- The boots.
- [sighs]
- Girl, we seen 'em quite a bit
now.
- Are you saying those boots
weren't made for boating?
[laughter]
- You really are an event.
It's a beautiful, simple boat,
and it has a chicness that you
always seem to have.
It's a good job.
- Thank you.
- Next up, Willam.
- I'm giving you maritime
realness with the starship
Willam.
[laughter]
Amenities include Wi-Fi.
There's a party deck and
a business center.
[laughter]
- Why is Pride important?
- I got married in California
when it was legal, and then now,
all of a sudden, it's not.
Prop 8 got my ass down hard.
So I love that I got to do
a Pride challenge, and this is
Dolce &amp; Gabbana, so I love it.
- So the coat is Dolce, and
the swimsuit is Gaultier.
It's chic, it's fashionable,
it's modern.
The boat looks like it was
professionally done even.
You give very good mast-head.
[laughter]
- And P.S.,
fuck you for
having the most amazing body
ever.
[laughter]
- Thank you, house of Willam.
All right, up next,
Phi Phi O'Hara.
- I just thought purple warrior
princess when you came out.
- I love your boat a lot.
I love the way you coordinated
the outfit with the boat.
And your makeup--you're on
the right track.
- I think you're like a
long-lost Kardashian sister.
You're so beautiful.
- Thank you.
- My one critique is just watch
out for your body shape still.
Right, if you're gonna be wide
there, then you got to give us
more hips, so just pay attention
to it, but you look stunning
tonight, baby.
Keep this up.
- Okay. I will.
- All right, ladies, I think
we've heard enough.
Now, while you untuck in
the interior illusions lounge,
the judges and I will
deliberate.
You may leave the stage.
Now, just between us girls,
what do you think?
Latrice Royale.
- Latrice, I think,
is the real deal.
The boat was very chic...
- The makeup was truly artwork.
Those friggin' boots.
- Oh, my God, they're like
Goth lesbian hiking boots.
I will burn them.
- All right, let's move on.
Phi Phi O'Hara.
- Before, I had a problem with
the makeup every single time.
Today was the best that it's
been.
- She is listening, and I think
the more we critique her,
the more she'll get it.
- On down the line we go to
Jiggly.
- I would have loved all of it
had she taken her cape off.
It looked like a tent.
- It almost looked like she was
walking in a straitjacket.
- It's because she could barely
fit in the boat.
- How very dare you?
- What?
- Big is beautiful.
- Love Jiggly.
Tonight it was an epic fail.
- Chad Michaels,
the pink cougar.
- Chad can do no wrong, but,
see, now I'm starting to have
a problem with that.
I want to see Chad be human
and not robotic.
- I have to agree with you.
I would like to see her a little
bit more messy.
- Sharon Needles.
- My mother's maiden name.
- Your mother's maiden name is
Needles?
- Sharon Needles.
- [laughs]
- I loved her whole snake
thing.
- She's very H.R. Pufnstuf.
[laughter]
- I love the fact that she,
like,
she didn't have perfect hair.
It was a bit messy.
All the stuff that we don't like
about Sharon Needles we love
about Chad, and all the stuff we
don't like about Chad we love
about Sharon Needles, so they
need to kind of, like, take tips
from each other.
- All right, Milan.
- I think she thinks she's
more real than she really is.
- Like, she don't need padding.
- Exactly.
- And her body language is
totally "dude in a dress."
- If she lip-synchs tonight and
that wig comes off,
stop it already.
- Right.
- All right, all right, Willam.
- Does anyone really look like
that?
My God.
- How dare they have better
legs than me!
How very dare they!
- Now, Billy, you really liked
the design of the float.
- It was so well done.
It wasn't as vulgar as Milan 's
was.
- The fact that she got out of
it and then made a performance
out of it was also very
entertaining as well.
- Dida Ritz.
- The outfit was very
pedestrian, very mall-like.
- If Dida didn't wear a T-shirt,
I would be saying something
completely different.
- Right.
- Does she deserve to be in the
bottom two
because of the T-shirt?
- Yeah!
- A T-shirt is half your outfit.
- She was the only one up there
with a camel toe.
- Hello!
- Very hot.
- I didn't go there.
[laughter]
- You always have to go there,
darling.
Especially when they're tucking.
[laughter]
- Silence!
I've made my decision.
Bring back...
my girls.
Welcome back, ladies.
It was the late, great drag
queen and civil rights pioneer
Marsha P. Johnson who fought
back when the police raided
Stonewall.
To honor her legacy, it's up to
you to keep on breaking through.
Based on your pride-filled
presentations, I've made some
decisions.
Chad Michaels, you're safe.
- Thank you.
- Latrice Royale...
You're safe.
- Thank you.
- Sharon Needles...
you're safe.
- Thank you.
- Willam, you navigated this
challenge beautifully, and we
were swept away.
Condragulations, you are
the winner of this challenge.
[applause]
You will receive a cruise,
courtesy of alandchuck.travel.
- I'm okay with that.
- [laughs]
- It feels correct to win.
When it's right, it's right.
Yes, girl!
- Phi Phi O'Hara...
you're safe.
- Thank you.
- Jiggly Caliente...
your message was uplifting,
but your float left us with
a sinking feeling.
I'm sorry, my dear, but you are
up for elimination.
- Fuck.
I cannot go this far and get
sent home.
Are you fucking kidding me?
- Dida Ritz, you're just
finding your sea legs, but has
the ship already sailed?
Milan, you set a course for
fabulous, but your message got
lost at sea.
Dida Ritz...
I'm throwing you a lifeline.
You're safe.
- Thank you.
- Milan, my dear, I'm sorry,
but you are up for elimination.
<i>- Ugh, I'm in the bottom again.</i>
<i>But when it's time for me to</i>
<i>bring it, I want to bring it.</i>
<i>Because it's a competition and</i>
<i>I'm here to win.</i>
- Two queens stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me and save yourself
from elimination.
The time has come for you to
lip-synch for your life.
Good luck,
and don't fuck it up.
- It doesn't matter if you
love him or capital H-I-M.
- I'm feeling ferocious.
I'm ready to attack.
I'm giving them 110%.
- Jiggly is working it.
She is feeling herself down.
She's trying to save her ass
right now.
[judges cheer]
- Milan, girl.
That's clearly a dude.
- Baby, you were born this way.
- You were born--you were born
this way.
- Yeah!
[cheers and applause]
- Ladies...
I've made my decision.
Jiggly Caliente...
Shante, you stay.
Jiggly, you may join the other
girls.
- Thank you.
- London, Paris, Milan,
the world is calling.
Now, sashay away.
- Thank you.
It was my moment to stop, and so
now I take on the next journey.
Have fun.
Realize that your purpose here
is to be an ambassador, to teach
a message of hope and love,
and every now and then, be the
bitch out of the competition.
- My lucky seven.
Don't be a drag.
Just be a queen.
And, remember, if you can't love
yourself, how in the hell you
gonna love somebody else?
Can I get a amen up in here?
all: Amen.
- All right, now let the music
play.
[upbeat music]-<i> It's Michelle Visage,</i>
<i>reporting live</i>
<i>from the red carpet</i>
<i>at</i><span style="bodyStyle"> RuPaul's Drag Race</i>

[cheers and applause]
Now, I am beyond excited
that all my girls are back
to help me crown
America's next drag superstar.
[cheers and applause]
[giggling]
But the thing that makes
tonight
and every night
so extra special
is you,
the<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> fans.</i>
[cheers and applause]
Honey, you have turned
Monday night into par-tay night!
That's right.
It's true.
I know that you all get
together, get your drink on,
scream shit at the TV screen.
I know what you do.
So whether you're watching
in a bar or at a house party
or kiki-ing with
#friendsonline...
[audience laughs]
I want everyone
within the sound of my voice
to scream,
"I'm sick and twisted,
and I'm not gonna take it
anymore!"
Come on, say it with me.
all: I'm sick and twisted,
and I'm not gonna take it
anymore!
- Again.
all: I'm sick and twisted,
and I'm not gonna take it
anymore!
- All right!
[cheers and applause]
So keep your freak flag
flying high.
And from the bottom
of my heart,
thank you for making this season
the biggest
in<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> herstory.</i>
It's true.
You know...
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
isn't about who gets eliminated,
it's about who keeps
coming back.
And tonight, so many
of our queens have returned.
Give it up for
the<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> royal box.</i>
[cheers and applause]
Hey, pork chop!
Hey, pork chop!
[laughing]
Now, are you ready for some
reunion realness?
[cheers and applause]
'Cause I have one thing to say.
Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best woman...win!
[cheers and applause]
[cheers and applause]
These first three queens
were only here
a few short weeks,
but they made a big splash.
Take a look.
- Hello, boys.
<i>My name is Penny Tration.</i>
<i>I was chosen</i>
in the online voting contest.
- Deeper, Penny Tration.
Girl, you're gonna put
Shelley Winters out of work.
- [laughing]
-<i> My name is Serena ChaCha,</i>
<i>and I'm interested in</i>
fine art drag.
There is, um, a new art movement
called soft sculpture.
It's more about creating
a sculpture
rather than just tailoring.
- Hello, girls.
<i>I'm Monica Beverly Hillz.</i>
<i>I have been called</i>
<i>ghetto,</i>
banjee, trashy.
<i>I was raised in the ghetto.</i>
<i>You know, I'm street smart,</i>
and there's nothing wrong
with that.
-<i> That is a nice ass.</i>
-<i> And it's not padded.</i>
-<i> Monica is slaying the hell</i>
<i>out of Serena,</i>
<i>and I'm very happy.</i>
- We all love you.
- We love you.
[cheers and applause]
- Welcome, ladies.
Welcome.
First up, Penny Tration.
Now, Penny, was it hard to, uh,
go home first?
- It was great.
I got to get away
from these bitches.
- Oh, okay. All right.
So now, which of the challenges
would you have rocked?
- Oh, I think
the reading challenge
was pretty much my forte.
- Oh, well, today's
your lucky day, darling,
because the library is open!
- Let's start with
a hometown favorite,
the lovely Detox.
Detox, when you walk down
the runway,
I do expect for the credits
to start running
for<i> Gorillas in the Mist.</i>
[laughter]
And to my dear, dear Serena,
I would read you,
but it does appear
life already has.
[audience "ohs"]
- All right.
Okay, well, now, the library
is closed...officially.
Next up, Serena ChaCha.
Now, your art school background
seemed to rub people
the wrong way.
So what would you have done
differently?
- I would've shut my ass up
and worn a sequin dress
and asked to borrow
one of Coco's pair of earrings
and walked down that runway
full of glam.
- Okay, well, which challenge
would you have rocked?
- As a fan of telenovelas,
Luis Fernando Sylvester
Montalban...
[speaking Spanish]
[cheers and applause]
-<i> Escandalo!</i>
Ugh!
Now, a lot of big revelations
happened
on the main stage,
but one of the most moving
came from Monica Beverly Hillz.
It raised a lot of questions
about what is drag
and what is trans.
When we come back,
I'm gonna ask Monica
for some answers.
Don't go away.
-<i> Coming up,</i>
<i>the queens answer</i>
<i>viewer questions.</i>
<i>So let's get this mother</i>
<i>trending.</i>
<i>Are you team Alaska?</i>
<i>Team Jinkx?</i>
<i>Or team Roxxxy?</i>
<i>Let your voice be heard</i>
<i>as we prepare to crown</i>
<i>America's next drag superstar.</i>
- [laughs]
Welcome back
to<i> RuPaul's Drag Race Reunited.</i>
We are just moments away
from finding out which queen
will be crowned America's
next drag superstar,
but first, let's talk
to another fierce queen,
Monica Beverly Hillz.
- Hi, mama.
- Now, Monica, you came
on to the show with passion,
poise, and a secret.
Let's take a look.
Monica, tell me
what's on your mind.
- It's true what you're saying.
There is a lot going
through my head.
I feel I'm not here.
I've just
been holding a secret in,
and I've been trying so hard,
and--
- What secret?
- I'm not just a drag queen.
I'm a transgendered woman.
[cheers and applause]
- Monica...
You know, there's a lot of
confusion out there,
so help everybody out.
Okay, now, can a girl
be a drag queen
and a trans woman
at the same time?
- Yes.
Drag is what I do.
Trans is who I am.
- All right. All right.
Yeah.
And you know, for the record,
everybody out there,
the only requirement
for being here is the desire
to be America's
next drag superstar,
and the only thing we screen for
is charisma, uniqueness,
nerve,
and talent.
[cheers and applause]
Now, uh, how have things been
since the show?
- It's been really great.
I actually got approached
by a cosmetic line.
I'm a face model now, so--
- What?
- I'm good at giving face, baby.
It's my moneymaker.
- Next up, a sexy Puerto Rican
and a bicoastal twosome
that made me do something
I thought I'd never do:
a double elimination.
Oh, shoot!
[laughs]
Take a look.
Honey Mahogany,
Vivienne Pinay,
neither one of you showed me
the fire it takes to stay.
I'm sending you both home.
Ladies, welcome.
Now, Vivienne, you've been
called
the fishiest queen ever.
Now, do you think
being fishy is enough?
- Well, for me it is.
[laughter]
Now, was it enough
for this season?
Obviously not.
If it were America's
next drag supermodel,
I would definitely be
in the top three.
- All right, all right.
Now...
Girl, I heard a rumor
that you work
for Alyssa Edwards now.
Is that true?
- [laughs]
Well, she likes to think so.
But I haven't received
my first paycheck, so...
- Oh, bitch.
- I don't know.
[audience "ohs"]
[laughing]
But what I have been doing,
I've been doing
makeup tutorials online.
- Oh, okay.
Do you think
I'd look good in makeup?
[audience laughing]
No, I'm serious.
I mean, I wanna try it.
- Well, girl...
[cheers and applause]
Girl, I like you
how you are right now
in your natural state.
- Uh-huh.
- But if you do wanna try it,
I would start off
with a tinted moisturizer.
- Okay, okay.
That's good advice.
Up next, Honey Mahogany.
Yes, mama.
Now, Honey, your style
was criticized
for being a little too
Bed, Bath, and Beyonce,
you know?
Now, what do you have to say
for yourself?
- Well, I found myself
a fab new style team
in San Francisco, where the look
does matter.
[audience cheers, laughs]
And, um, I have a little
something I'd like to show you.
- Oh.
Ooh, ooh.
Ooh!
[cheers and applause]
- All right.
- [mouthing words]
- Wow.
- Do you want me
to turn around?
Should I turn around?
- Yeah.
- Yes.
- All right.
TrimSpa, baby.
[laughter]
Now, Honey, as our first
San Francisco queen,
can you describe
the San Francisco style?
- You know, it's hard to
describe the San Francisco style
because there are so many
different types of drag
in San Francisco.
We have fairies,
we have bearded ladies,
we have glamour queens,
pageant girls,
the Ducal Court--
we've got it all.
- Oh, all right.
I love it!
Now, Honey, San Francisco
is so proud of you
and so am I.
Keep representing, girl.
- Thank you, Ru.
- Up next, Lineysha Sparx.
Now--
[cheers and applause]
So, now, Lineysha,
Charo couldn't make it tonight
to translate, so why don't you
address the audience
in Spanish?
It might be easier
in your native tongue.
- Of course.
[speaking Spanish]
[cheers and applause]
- I couldn't have
said it better myself.
Really, I couldn't have.
Lineysha, you know I love you,
but this season,
you committed a sin
that is unforgivable.
- Yeah?
- Take a look.
Who is playing Diana Ross?
- That would be
Miss Lineysha here.
- Are you familiar with
Diana Ross and the Supremes?
- Um, not really, no.
[glass shattering]
- Okay.
- [laughing]
- Okay.
Lineysha, do you know
who Diana Ross is now?
- Well, right now, yes.
I love--she's banana dance.
That is not--
- That's Josephine Baker, baby.
- Ah, sorry.
Um, no, but it's just kidding.
It's just kidding.
- Okay, so name
a Diana Ross song.
- Diana Ross song?
I know that she move like this.
And she's--
That was--I was practicing.
- Um, immigration?
- Ru! How rude!
[laughter and applause]
- Immigration?
- [giggling]
- Well, you're not alone,
because I know there are
a lot of young'uns out there
that could use a course
in gay miracles.
Pay attention, because there
will be a pop quiz.
Time for your Drag Race
herstory minute.
The reading rainbow
begins with
the one and only Judy Garland.
You know, she played that girl
in the stoner film
about the ruby-red pumps.
The glamorous '40s gave us
broads like Bette Davis,
Joan Crawford,
and Lena Horne.
The '50s dropped
atomic blonde bombshells--
Marilyn Monroe, Doris Day,
and Etta James.
That's right, a sister can have
blonde hair too.
The swinging '60s gave us
the super-duper Supremes,
"Tinta" Turner,
and Barbra Streisand.
Well, hello, gorgeous!
The "me" decade of the 1970s
saw Diana go solo,
Dolly split with Porter,
and Farrah told
<i>Charlie's Angels</i>
to kiss her T&amp;A good-bye.
The '80s were a holiday,
as the rhythm nation showed
its true colors with Madonna,
Janet, and Cyndi.
Oh, and Faye Dunaway
stole my heart
with just three little words:
"No wire hangers!"
The '90s were dominated
by Mimi,
Whitney, Britney, and X-Tina
and a little girl group
goin' by the name
of Destiny's Child.
Which brings us to today's
reigning divas:
Gaga, Beyonce, Katy, and Nicki.
And if you didn't learn
anything else,
just remember one thing:
Cher, Cher, Cher, Cher, stupid.
And that's today's
drag herstory minute.
[laughs]
And, honey, that's just the tip
of the iceberg.
So please tweet me
your favorite divas @RuPaul.
It takes a village, people!
-<i> Coming up...</i>
<i>The final face-off between</i>
<i>fierce rivals</i>
<i>Coco Montrese</i>
<i>and Alyssa Edwards.</i>
<i>Who will be crowned America's</i>
<i>next drag superstar?</i>
<i>Find out when</i><span style="bodyStyle"> RuPaul's</i>
Drag Race Reunited<i> continues.</i>
- [laughs]
Welcome back
to<i> RuPaul's Drag Race Reunited.</i>
Now, these next two queens
represented
the ultimate contrast
in styles.
One was quiet, ladylike,
and demure,
and the other was, well,
Jade Jolie.
Take a look.
-<i> I'm the sweetest bitch</i>
<i>you'll meet,</i>
<i>but if you come for me,</i>
then you'll see
a whole new side.
Girl, you ain't that pretty.
- Oh.
- Cover girl,
don't cover boy, baby.
You're a dirty bitch.
- I don't understand
why you're trying
to like come for me.
- You had rolls
all over the place in the back.
It was disgusting.
- Back rolls?
-<i> My name is Ivy Winters.</i>
- Are those your pictures
on there?
- They're all my face.
I will figure out a way
to turn it into a costume.
- You make everything
that you wear?
- I do.
- You're mind-blowingly
talented.
- This week's winner is...
Ivy! Ivy!
[echoing]
Ivy Winters!
- Hi, mama.
- [laughs]
Miss Jolie.
You know,
when you first arrived,
everybody thought you were
gonna be the sweet one.
But you turned into
a Sour Patch Kid.
What was going on?
- Me too.
I swear I was America's
sweetheart until I watched it.
I was like,
that's a cunt, honey.
[laughter]
But it was rainbowy
and gorgeous, so it was okay.
- Now, I wanna ask you,
do you regret accusing
Alyssa Edwards of having...
back rolls?
- Oh, my gosh.
- Back rolls?
- [laughs]
I consider Alyssa
one of my very good friends,
and I think she's fabulous
and fierce.
- All right.
Up next, Ivyyyyy Winters!
Now, Ivy, you showcased
one breathtaking outfit
after another.
Now, do you think
the other queens were jealous?
- No, I sew
for a lot of drag queens,
so if you're jealous, you can
always call me.
- Oh, okay. All right.
Well, it pays to advertise.
[laughter]
Do you have any regrets?
- Yes, I would have to say
my Marilyn.
- Oh, is that who you were
playing?
- That's what I was--
[laughs]
- What was it like
to see yourself
as Norma Jean, Miss Thang?
- That was, like, the first time
I've ever tried
impersonating someone.
- Yeah.
- I wish I would've went
with my second choice.
- So what would you have done
if you hadn't done Marilyn?
- I would've done Julia Child.
- Really?
- [as Julia Child]
<i>Bonjour!</i>
Welcome to my kitchen.
My name is Marilyn Monroe.
[cheers and applause]
- Keep that sewing machine
humming away, girl.
Now, Ivy, I've gotta confess.
I wanna tell you why I say,
"Ivyyyyy Winters!"
- Thank God.
- Yes.
Now, to help me with this
explanation,
please welcome the star
of<i> Life With La Toya,</i>
La Toya Jackson.
[cheers and applause]
- Hi!
- Thank you very much.
- Now, La Toya, you have been
a guest judge
on<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
more than any other person.
- [giggles]
- Why do you keep coming back?
- Because I love the show, Ru,
and I love you.
- Aw, thank you.
Thank you.
- I do.
- That's very sweet.
Now, La Toya, in 1989,
you did a pay-per-view concert
called<i> A Sizzling Spectacular.</i>
Do you remember that?
- Sort of, yeah.
- Well, I gotta tell ya.
I became so obsessed
with the way
you introduced
musician Edgar Winters.
Would you introduce him
for me now?
- Okay.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Edgar Winters!
- Yeah, okay.
Well, but I gotta tell ya,
it was more like,
"Ivyyyyy Winterrrrs!"
- Edgarrrrrr Winters!
- I want everybody
in the audience to say it.
all: Ivyyyyy Winters.
- Okay, now, La Toya,
you say Edgar Winters.
- Okay.
Edgarrrr Winters!
[laughter]
- Ivyyyyy Winters!
- No! Edgarrrrr Winters,
you guys!
- [cackling]
- It is.
I don't know.
Now you know.
- La Toya, thank you so much
for clearing that up.
And I know you gotta go,
but would you like to hear
a little bit of our new duet
as you leave?
- Ooh, of course I would.
Are you kidding?
- It's called<i> Feel Like Dancin'.</i>
Hit it!
- Let the music play.
See you later, Toy-Toy.
Oh, wow!
Now, all drag queens
throw shade,
but this season,
Coco Montrese
and Alyssa Edwards
were heavyweight champions.
Let's take a look.
- Oh, boys!
- And then walks in
Coco Montrese.
- Oh, my God!
Alyssa Edwards.
-<i> We haven't spoke</i>
<i>in two years.</i>
- It was pure hell!
- And the Academy Award
goes to--
- Fuck you, Alyssa.
- And look how orange
you fucking look, girl.
- Now, Miss Alyssa...
- Whoo-whoo!
- Now, you pushed it.
- I'm joking with you.
- I'm not joking, bitch!
- Ladyboys and gentlemen,
it's the rematch of the century!
The Rumble
in the Lipstick Jungle!
Welcome to the center ring
Coco Montrese
and Alyssa Edwards!
[cheers and applause]
- Oh!
both: Mwah. Mwah.
- Ladies, welcome.
- Hello, hello.
- Now, I think I speak
on behalf
of all the<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> fans</i>
everywhere when I say,
"Girl, your feud was endless,
honey."
And confusing!
It was so confusing,
am I right?
But I think I finally
figured it out.
So I'm gonna try
and explain it to everyone
just like my play cousin
Cornisha would, okay?
All right.
Alyssa was crowned
Miss Thing USA,
but after she came up,
she wasn't holding it down
no mo'.
- [scoffs]
- So and since Coco
was still thirsty,
she damn well
cold-snatched the crown.
So Alyssa thought Coco
was frontin',
just 'cause she was grinding up
as first runner-up,
you know what I'm saying?
So basically, y'all mad
'cause y'all friends.
Am I right, ladies?
- [laughs]
- Yeah!
- That's what I thought.
- That's it.
- That's what I thought.
- I will say that coming
into it and seeing Coco,
I really wasn't bothered so much
about the pageant drama...
More or less how we were going
to be interacting
with each other.
- Yes. Okay.
So, Coco, what was it like
hearing the other queens say
that your makeup was busted?
- I mean, watching myself
back on TV,
I was like, "Ooh!
You do look like a Dorito."
[laughter]
But I think I got it now,
I think.
[cheers and applause]
- It looks good.
Well, Coco and Alyssa,
your lip-sync battle
was epic,
and I'm not the only one
who thinks so.
Watch this.
-<i> Hi, Alyssa. Hi, Coco.</i>
<i>It was so exciting for me</i>
<i>to see you two ladies</i>
<i>lip-sync to my song</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
Cold Hearted Snake
<i>during this year's</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
Drag Race.
<i>If it were up to me,</i>
<i>neither of you'd go home.</i>
<i>You were fantastic.</i>
<i>Just remember this, ladies.</i>
<i>America loves you,</i>
<i>and so do I.</i>
<i>And so does Thumbelina.</i>
[cheers and applause]
- Coco and Alyssa,
stay right where you are.
I'm not through with you yet.
-<i> Coming up, Detox comes clean,</i>
<i>the queens answer</i>
<i>your questions,</i>
<i>and we get the T</i>
<i>from the final three</i>
<i>before we crown America's</i>
<i>next drag superstar,</i>
<i>when</i><span style="bodyStyle"> RuPaul's Drag Race</i>
Reunited<i> continues.</i>
- [laughs]
Welcome back
to<i> RuPaul's Drag Race Reunited.</i>
I'm here
with best frenemies
Coco Montrese
and Alyssa Edwards.
Now, Alyssa, your father
sent a message
and it really did bring
everyone to tears, you know?
Let's take a look at that.
- Oh, gosh.
- Somebody's dad
is on the phone.
- I know it's not mine.
My dad wouldn't even know
how to use the Skype.
[chuckles]
-<i> Hey, Alyssa, this is Dad.</i>
- Alyssa...
- [gasps]
-<i> I just wanted you to know...</i>
<i>[voice breaks]</i>
<i>That I'm proud of you.</i>
<i>And now I'm not ashamed</i>
<i>to tell people</i>
<i>that my son's gay.</i>
- Oh, oh, my God.
[crying]
- Wow, wow.
- Ooh.
[applause]
- So, Alyssa...
what's happened with your dad
since the show aired?
- For the very first time
in my life,
I'm starting to feel
forgiveness.
It's the most powerful feeling
one could ever feel,
and we are working on developing
a relationship.
My father is a grandfather,
and everything
that he couldn't do
for me or my siblings,
he's making up for with my niece
and nephews.
- I love it. I love it.
[cheers and applause]
That's right.
You know,<i> RuPaul's Drag Race--</i>
still bringing families
together.
[laughter]
It's true.
Now, Alyssa,
Santino accused you
of wearing the worst dress
in five seasons.
But sometimes, the memory can
play tricks on us.
Take a look.
There's corn hanging
from her hand!
[laughter]
- It's not just an outfit,
it's a lifestyle.
[all screaming]
[laughter]
[buzzer]
- She's a little frosty.
- I see a lot of armpit.
Like, armpit!
- But it's fresh.
[laughter]
- ChaCha.
- She has to start thinking
about the way she's gonna
execute her fashions.
- Well, she executed this
fashion.
[laughter]
- Yes, honey,
this is a two-page spread.
- Ugh, it looks like a couch
from Rent-a-Center.
- Oh, Lord.
- Well, right now,
you're a mess.
Things are falling off.
No one can accuse you
of not having
a great pair of legs.
- [laughs]
- First of all.
[laughter and applause]
- No T, no shade, ladies.
Now, Santino.
- Yes?
- Do you still think Alyssa's
dress is the worst
in five seasons?
- I do.
[laughter]
And this is why, okay?
- Can we take a vote?
Can we take a vote?
- This is why.
Every season, Ru asks the queens
to make a dress
and do it
in four to six hours.
Alyssa, you brought that dress
with you.
[laughter]
You brought that dress
with you.
That dress, it doesn't look
as bad on TV
as it did in person, but--
[audience "ohs"]
But I tweeted to you,
I said,
"You know, the thing I hope
for Alyssa
"is that she can tour the world
"so that everyone can see
the worst dress
in<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> history."</i>
[laughter and applause]
- You know, I'm sensing
a lot of sexual tension
between you two.
I mean, you guys,
I think y'all need to hook up,
and make this shit happen.
Y'all need to go and fuck,
you know what I'm saying?
[laughter and applause]
You two. You two.
[cheers and applause]
- Yeah!
- That's--that's what needs
to happen.
- Yeah.
- That's exactly
what needs to happen.
- Now, our next queen
was one of the best ever
in the history of<i> Drag Race.</i>
Don't believe me?
Just ask her.
Take a look.
- Wow.
[cheers and applause]
My name is Detox,
and I am 27 years old.
- How many black cocks
had to die for that outfit?
- [laughs]
-<i> My tits are bouncing</i>
<i>everywhere.</i>
<i>I have a great body,</i>
<i>so why not show it off?</i>
<i>The only thing</i>
<i>I haven't had done</i>
is my knees and my nose
and my big toe.
<i>And I'm the queen bee,</i>
<i>so eat it up</i>
and crown it.
[cheers and applause]
- Detox, welcome!
Welcome, Detox.
All right, first question.
Why it gotta be gray?
- [laughs]
Um, well, it was a gray day
in Los Angeles
when I got kicked off, so--
- Oh, okay.
- Was it not?
- Yeah.
Now, Detox, coming into
this competition,
you were one fierce
and funny queen.
- I was?
- Yes, and now that
the competition's over,
girl, you still are.
How you feelin'?
- I'm feeling amazing.
It's been, like, the most
magical experience
I've ever had.
It's been a complete blast,
and the fact that I'm able
to tour the world
with some of my best girlfriends
and do something
that I love and art of drag
that I love so much
is just beyond amazing to me,
and I'm so happy and thrilled.
- I love your collaborations
with Willam and Vicky Vox.
Now, I heard that you were all
recently performing in Dubai.
- Yeah.
Li-li-li-li-li-li-li!
- Did you have to wear a burka?
- No, we wanted to wear burkas,
but then we just said
fuck it,
and we're sluts.
I mean, hello, look at Willam.
That's his aesthetic.
- Now, you were also outspoken
in your criticism
of some of the younger queens.
Do you still feel that they
treated the show as...
[old woman voice]
Rupaul's School for Girls?
- There were certain girls--
like, some of the larger names
and the people that have been
in the industry
for a long time
that would be torn apart
for doing
what they do the best,
whereas some of the judges
were treating them
as, you know, students.
Yes, you.
- Are you talking to Santino?
- I'm talking to both of 'em,
Santino and Michelle.
- Oh.
[laughs]
- I don't give--y'all know
I don't give two shits.
[laughter and cheering]
- Now, just between us girls...
- Mm-hmm.
- As a member of Rolaskatox...
- Mm-hmm.
- Who should be crowned
America's next drag superstar?
- Detox.
- [laughs]
[cheers and applause]
But--yeah, you're not eligible.
Oh, whatever.
- [laughs]
- Thanks for sharing, Detox.
Now, before I go any further,
I'd like to take this moment
to say something
I've actually never said
on national television before.
Can you bring the camera closer?
[laughter]
Closer.
Now, back the fuck up.
Not that close.
[sighs]
Okay, this is hard for me.
Due to the fact that her thighs
spread just like...
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Whoo-hoo!
Whoo!
Don't go anywhere.
We'll be right back
with the final three, hunty.
-<i> Coming up, we'll announce</i>
<i>the viewer's choice</i>
<i>for Miss Congeniality.</i>
<i>Who should be America's</i>
<i>next drag superstar?</i>
<i>Are you team Alaska,</i>
<i>team Jinkx, or team Roxxxy?</i>
<i>Let's keep things trending</i>
<i>as</i><span style="bodyStyle"> RuPaul's Drag Race Reunited</i>
<i>keeps on keepin' on.</i>
- [laughs]
Welcome back
to<i> RuPaul's Drag Race Reunited.</i>
And now, the reason
we're all here tonight.
Please welcome back
to the stages the final three.
Alaska.
Jinkx Monsoon.
Roxxxy Andrews.
Welcome, ladies.
You look sickening.
Now, I have so much
I have to ask you,
but first, we're gonna
take some questions
from the fans.
Inquiring minds want to know.
This first one here
is for Jinkx.
The Duchess of Dork
wants to know
about your crush on Ivyyyy.
"Did you guys ever hook up
after the show?"
- Well, when you're held
in captivity
in a little pink hamster cage,
eventually, you just look
for the cutest person
in the room,
and I chose Ivy Winters.
[laughter]
- You know, Ivy,
was there a love connection?
- I was actually shocked
when I was watching
the episode with my boyfriend...
- Me too.
- And he was like, "Oh."
- I didn't know
they were gonna air that.
[laughter]
But nothing ever came of it,
and we're actually
just very good friends,
you know,
and I've met her boyfriend,
he's very charming.
- I mean, honestly, wha--
I mean, really,
what's the problem?
I mean, triads
are really in right now.
- [laughs]
- And honestly,
I could see a spin-off show
like, you know,
<i>Drag Sister Wives</i>
or something like that.
All right, this next question
is for Alaska.
Oscar asks, "Do you think
being part of Rolaskatox
helped or hurt you?"
- I knew Detox
from a long time ago,
and she knew Roxxxy
from a long time ago,
so we were just, like,
friends,
and we needed a prescription
drug for gagging,
so we called it Rolaskatox.
- [laughs]
- I don't think it really
hurt me,
but Michelle hated it.
And she called us "Rolodex."
I don't even know
what a Rolodex is!
[laughter and applause]
- Now, Roxxxy, what about you?
Do you think it helped
or hurt you?
- To me, it was never,
you know,
"Well, I'm gonna be
on<i> Survivor</i><span style="bodyStyle"> right now,"</i>
and be like,
"This is my alliance,
"and we're gonna stick together
and get everybody out of here."
It was never that,
so when she said
she wanted to go off
on her own,
we were like, "Girl,
we love you no matter what."
Like, "Go on and do your thing
if that's what you feel
you need to do."
- Jinkx, you were not
in Rolaskatox.
What are your thoughts?
Did you feel alienated by it?
- Well, you know, cliques
can either help or hinder you.
They can be a big distraction,
but even though they had
a clique, I had a mantra.
[laughter]
- Which was?
- Let's say it together,
ladies and gentlemen.
all: Water off a duck's back.
[laughter]
- Now, this next question
is for Roxxxy.
Gwen asks,
"Do you honestly feel
"that comedy drag
is insulting,
or was that you just playing
mind games?"
- You know, I take drag very,
very seriously,
and sometimes--
I noticed on the show--
too seriously.
And no, it's not insulting
at all whatsoever,
and you know,
they're my complete opposites,
and that's what
makes them magic,
and I can learn a lot
from them.
- All right.
Now, this next question
is from Johnny B.
This is for Alyssa.
"Have you figured out
what Alyssa's secret is yet?"
[laughter and cheers]
- Well, Johnny, if I told you,
it wouldn't be a secret.
- So is--that's a "No,
you don't know what it is"?
[laughter]
- It's 9 inches
and fully functional.
- Oh, my God!
[laughs]
[cheers and applause]
Not so secret anymore,
is it?
Now, this next question
is to all the queens.
Ian asks, "What motivated you
to do the show,
the title or the $100,000?"
Let's start here with Alaska.
- Um, what motivated me
was the fact
that I auditioned
for every single season
and never made it,
so it eventually became
a personal vendetta
to get on the program.
[laughter and cheers]
- And what about you?
- Honestly, since I was
five years old,
this is what I wanted to do.
You know--
- This show was on
when you were five years old?
- No, I used to say--
I used to watch
<i>Death Becomes Her,</i>
and I knew I wanted to grow up
to be Meryl Streep.
[cheers and applause]
- All right, Roxxxy,
title or moola?
- Definitely the title
and the competition.
I'm a pageant girl.
I like to compete,
and that was the platform
to show the world
that I could be
America's next drag superstar
and compete with
the best of the best,
which,
I think this season is the best
of the best.
Nothing against the other ones.
[laughter and jeering]
- Now, you know, every year,
we ask our fans to vote
for Miss Congeniality,
and this year,
the choice was tougher
than ever.
Now, to help me bestow
this honor, please welcome
last year's Miss Congeniality,
Latrice Royale.
[cheers and applause]
Hey, mommy.
- Hey!
- Looking good.
- And feeling gorgeous, baby.
- Hey.
Now, Latrice, would you please
do us the honors?
- This year's Miss Congeniality
is...
[suspenseful music]
Ivyyyyy Winters!
- Condragulations, Ivy.
You have won a six-night stay
plus airfare
for you and a guest
from Hilton Hotels and Resorts.
Now, you can stay Hilton.
Go out at one of their
550 locations in 80 countries.
- Oh, my gosh.
Oh, thank you guys so much.
Thank you so much.
I feel like I just won!
Thank you, mwah.
- All right, Ivy.
Now, sissy that walk.
Sissy that walk.
[cheers and applause]
- I love you.
-<i> Who will be crowned</i>
<i>America's next drag superstar?</i>
<i>Are you team Alaska,</i>
<i>team Jinkx,</i>
<i>or team Roxxxy?</i>
<i>Keep tweeting,</i>
<i>and find out when</i>
RuPaul's Drag Race Reunited
<i>continues.</i>
- [laughs]
Welcome back
to<i> RuPaul's Drag Race Reunited.</i>
Now, I'm here with
our final three: Alaska...
[cheers and applause]
Jinkx Monsoon...
[cheers and applause]
And Roxxxy Andrews!
[cheers and applause]
Now, in less time
than it takes
to microwave
a chicken pot pie,
one of them will be crowned
America's next drag superstar.
Not only did these three queens
snatch our hearts, but they
tickled our funny bones.
Take a look.
Direct from<i> Grey Gardens,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
it's little Edie Beale.
- Oh, hi, RuPaul.
- How is big Edie doing?
- She's always begging
for the pate,
but the label is faded.
I can never tell if it's pate
or if it's giblets for the cats.
[laughter]
- My old, old friend,
Lady Bunny.
- You know, the last time
I had a battle of the browns
was about ten minutes ago
in my dressing room.
[laughter]
- Tamar Braxton!
- Get your life.
- Paula Deen is out of control.
This morning, she put a stick
of butter--
- On her--boom!
Louboutins,
'cause her fat-ass feet
don't fit in 'em.
[laughter]
Boom, boom, baby.
Rock, rock.
- [laughs]
Now, Alaska, were you nervous
to play a character like
Lady Bunny, who's you know,
already very funny?
- I was really nervous,
'cause she's so old.
[laughter]
- [gasping laugh]
- And I was gonna do
Michelle Obama,
but that was already taken,
so...
[laughter]
- Oh!
- Now, when Coco
and some of the other queens
hadn't heard
of<i> Grey Gardens,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
it caused quite the controversy
online.
- Quite the scandal, really.
[laughter]
[cheers and applause]
- Now, Jinkx, were you surprised
by that?
- Uh--I was surprised by
America's reaction.
I didn't know that many people
knew about her,
but I was thrilled to see it,
you know?
- All right.
Roxxxy, now, you say you're not
a comedy queen,
but your Tamar Braxton
slayed the children
dot com, girl.
- Dot com.
- Yes.
- I wanted to do somebody
that I knew
could be funny off the bat.
Her personality
is so off-the-wall
that if you didn't know her,
you wanted to laugh at her,
so that's why
I went with Tamar.
I love you, Tamar.
- Well, they say imitation
is the sincerest form
of flattery,
but sometimes, it could really
piss people off.
Let's take a look.
<i>The final three are so bitchy,</i>
<i>they don't just throw shade,</i>
<i>they "blank" it.</i>
- Well, I don't know them
personally,
so I said they airmail it,
though that's frightfully
expensive.
Hi, Jinkx, it's me, Bebe Wood
from<i> The New Normal.</i>
You do the second-best
impression of little Edie.
- [laughs]
- I just know Ru's
going to make
the staunch decision.
- [squeals]
- Good luck,
and don't funk it up.
- [screaming laugh]
-<i> Lady Bunny, same question.</i>
- They throw it so hard
that it casts
more of a shadow than
Alyssa Edwards' overbite
on her nonexistent chin.
[laughter]
Alaska, I wanted to tell you
that your impersonation of me
was spot on.
And I'm gonna get you for that.
[laughter]
-<i> All right, Tamar Braxton!</i>
- They do that on over-the-top
shade dot com, okay?
Boom!
Get your life.
[laughter]
Where my Roxxxy at?
She is my queen dot com,
and I know she fixin' to do me
proud, okay?
Boom! Yes!
- Boom!
[laughter]
- I love it!
I love it.
Condragulations, ladies,
you're a hit.
Now, ladies, it's time to get
serious.
Assume the position, because I'm
about to do one final
examination of your charisma,
uniqueness, nerve, and talent.
I hope you showered.
First up, Alaska.
Hi-ee.
- Hi-ee.
- Hi-ee!
- Hi-ee!
[laughter]
- Now, your wicked wit
and junkyard couture
have served you well
in your journey from tragic
to magic.
Let's take a look.
- Hi-ee.
Hi-ee. Hi-ee!
<i>My name is Alaska.</i>
- You're finally here.
- I know, yay.
- A tired, second-rate version
of your husband.
- Ohh!
[both grunt]
- Isn't Sharon the superstar
of the relationship?
- I had to choose,
am I gonna
be bitter
or become her biggest fan?
[singing over each other]
- Whoa, stop there.
- Don't worry about your group,
whoever you're with.
Worry about you.
Something's missing, Alaska.
Bring it.
-<i> Dangerous.</i>
<i>Flawless.</i>
<i>Overpriced.</i>
- You're the winner
of this challenge.
- Ah!
- You are the winner
of this week's challenge.
- Ah!
I am the queen
who takes the tragic
and turns it into magic.
I take trash and turn it into
treasure,
and having never fallen
into the bottom two,
I am Alaska,
and I am America's next
drag superstar!
[echoing]
Thank you.
[cheers and applause]
- I love it.
Now, Alaska,
what has<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> meant to you?</i>
- It's just, like--like, I
can't even believe
I'm sitting
in this spot right now,
and all these
fucking people are here.
Hi-ee!
all: Hi-ee!
- Now, Alaska, you're part
of a drag super couple.
Now, is that a blessing
or a curse?
- I think it's an awesome
blessing,
because I couldn't choose
a better person who is--
who could be so supportive
and who's always there for me
and always believes in me,
even when I don't believe
in myself.
And I get to wear
all of her designer clothes.
[laughter]
- So, Sharon, what's it like
watching Alaska up here?
- It's--it's embarrassing.
Um, no, I'm--I'm--it--
[laughter]
I'm--I'm kidding.
When you look
at Alaska Thunderfuck--
when I look at you right now,
you have the tangible,
marketable beauty
of Roxxxy Andrews
and the campy theatrics
of Jinkx Monsoon,
and in my heart,
you are America's
next drag superstar,
and you and me
will be the most famous people
in reality television
from Pittsburgh, next to
Abby Lee Miller, of course.
[laughter]
[cheers and applause]
- Pam, did you know that Alaska
would grow up to be
a world-famous drag queen?
- Never in a million years
would I have ever dreamt
that he would've grown up
to be a famous drag queen.
I-I have four children,
I'm proud of all of them,
and I wanted them all
to be happy.
I have an Air Force man,
an Army man,
a medical daughter,
and now--
- And this.
- I'm well--no!
I'm so--I'm so well-rounded
with you.
I love you.
I'm so, so proud.
- Now, Alaska, what would it
mean to you
to be America's
next drag superstar?
- [stammering]
[laughter]
I mean, it would change my life.
And just being here and doing
this experience has already
changed my life, and that would
just be so amazing.
And with the money, I would buy
100,000 slices of pizza
and share it with all of you.
- Oh, yummy.
- Aww.
- I love pizza.
- Me too.
- Alaska, it's been a real joy
to watch you blossom,
and you walk
in no one's shadow.
You are a force to be reckoned
with, because Alaska
is a thunder-fucking star,
y'all!
[cheers and applause]
-<i> Coming up, Jinkx and Roxxxy</i>
<i>spill the T when</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
RuPaul's Drag Race Reunited
<i>continues.</i>
- [laughs]
Welcome back
to<i> RuPaul's Drag Race Reunited.</i>
In a moment,
we'll be crowning
America's next drag superstar,
but first,
I've drilled Alaska.
Now, it's time for me to probe
Jinkx Monsoon.
Take a look.
-<i> My name is Jinkx Monsoon.</i>
I am Seattle's premier Jewish
narcoleptic drag queen.
- What's on your head?
- Just a little headpiece.
- It's rather pedestrian.
Jinkx, oh, Jinkx.
[sighs]
I love it!
- [laughs]
I left my youngest brother
with a woman
who wasn't ready to be a mom.
To say that
"You're just a comedy queen"
is belittling something
I have made my whole career on.
- Jinkx, I have--
- I am talking.
- Oh.
-<i> I am in it to win it.</i>
<i>To dismiss me</i>
<i>would be a bad move.</i>
You should be taking me
as a threat.
[snores]
[laughter]
[cheers and applause]
- Wow.
[laughs]
So, Jinkxy, how are you feeling
at this very moment?
You're not sleepy at all,
are ya?
- I-I-I could use a nap, but--
[laughter]
I feel like a more fully
realized drag queen.
I feel like a more fully
realized human being.
I remember hearing you say
you've been through many phases
in your drag,
and I think I've entered
Jinkx 2.0,
the butterfly phase.
[laughter]
[cheers and applause]
- So tell me, what has been
your proudest moment
on the show?
- Honestly, working with Dave,
my veteran.
[cheers and applause]
Right there.
- You've been very open about
some childhood issues
you had with your mother
and your brother.
How are things now?
- You know, things are
wonderful.
<i>Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> kind of brought</i>
our family back together again,
and it caused us to have
some really
adult conversations.
- Are they here?
Are they here tonight?
- He's right over there.
- Oh.
- They're both there.
- So, Deanne, what was it like
having your Jinkxy discuss
family issues on television?
- Well, it hurt, mainly because
I saw how much
I hurt my child,
but at the same time,
it was good,
because it--it made--
it helped us to become
even closer.
- All right, yeah,
let the healing begin.
[applause]
Jacob, what's it like having
a drag queen for a brother?
- [chuckles]
Well, I never
really thought of him
as a drag queen.
I've just always thought of him
as my big brother,
and I know he's worked
so hard,
and I'm so proud of him
for being here.
And don't forget,
it's Monsoon season.
- [laughs]
[cheers and applause]
So, Jinkx, what would it mean
to you
to become America's next
drag superstar?
- I would love to be given
the chance
to use this as a platform
to be an advocate
for social change.
I'm lucky enough to live in
Washington
where gay marriage
is legal, and...
[cheers and applause]
I don't want to rest until
that's the truth
for all of America.
[laughs]
- Well, Jinkx, you have
continued to surprise
and delight your fans.
Best of all, I think you've even
surprised yourself.
I'm so proud to have you
sitting here tonight.
Now, our next queen is a blast
from drag's proud pageant
past
and an important part
of its future.
Roxxxy Andrews.
Let's take a look.
-<i> My name is Roxxxy Andrews.</i>
- Condragulations.
- Oh!
- You are the winner
of this challenge.
[record scratch]
- Are you saying "sequin" or--
- Sequence dress.
- "Sequin dress" I think
is what you mean.
- Sequence.
- What do you call it
when you flat-line?
- You're dead.
- I come off as a strong
character,
but I'm so weak
at the same time!
[sobs]
- Bam!
- Oh.
- Condragulations,
you are the winner
of this week's challenge.
- You look stunning.
- Thank you so much.
<i>I think it's time to crown</i>
a thick and juicy kind of girl.
- You're an amazing queen.
[laughs]
[cheers and applause]
Roxxxy, Roxxxy, Roxxxy,
how are you feeling
at this very moment?
- Oh, my God,
words cannot express
how happy I am to be here
and to experience this,
and y'all showing me
so much love.
I love it.
- Well, I know that getting
ready for the finale, you were
very emotional.
Tell me about that.
- Um, some of the things
on the show that--
how I was acting,
and I was acting that way,
it got the best of me at points,
and, you know,
I said a lot of hurtful things
to Jinkx,
and the most important thing
to me is our relationship,
and she is an amazing person
and she's extremely talented
and just as good as a competitor
as I am, if not better.
[applause]
- More than ever before,
a lot of people
have attacked you online about
how you were on the show.
How has that affected you?
- It's affected me a lot.
You know, you want to say
you don't listen to it
and you don't pay attention
to it, but when you're, like,
going on social media networks,
you do run into those things,
and it hurts my feelings,
and you know, I just
have to pick myself back up.
Like--you know what I'm saying?
Like, you can't let it
get you down, just, you know,
that there's people out there
who do love you
and do understand where
you are coming from
and have been
in that same place.
We're all human.
We all make mistakes.
That was completely messy,
and I can't believe
I went there,
but I shouldn't have done that.
- Is there anything you'd like
to say to Jinkx right now?
- I love you to death,
and regardless of the things--
I wrote her, and I've written
you and I've told you that,
you know, I love you.
- And called me personally.
- And regardless if I win, lose,
or draw this contest,
she's somebody that I want
in my life
for the rest of my life,
and I have learned so much
from her and Alaska.
- Now, Jinkx, is there anything
you'd like to say to Roxxxy?
- I think people forget
sometimes that even though
sisters love each other,
sisters can also get
into some pretty bad fights,
you know?
But through all of it,
we're sisters.
- I think you two hookers
should hug it out.
[laughter]
[cheers and applause]
- [laughs]
- Okay.
[laughs]
- And if I may, I think
you're both awful.
[laughter]
[cheers and applause]
- Sadly, your legendary
drag mother Erica Andrews
recently passed away.
Did she get to see the show?
- She was at the hospital,
and she was texting me,
and she was telling me,
um, how proud she was of me
and, you know, she got to see
at least two episodes,
and then she ended up passing.
She was a wonderful person,
and if you ever got to meet her,
you knew exactly...
How beautiful she was, and...
[sniffs]
The hardest thing was during
rehearsal yesterday.
I had a little breakdown.
Those were the times
I would call her
and she would know exactly
what to tell me,
and I didn't have her to call
yesterday,
but my heart always tells me
what she would say,
and I knew inside,
she was just,
"Pick yourself up,
show them how beautiful
"you can be inside and out,
and...
walk with your head
held high."
- That's right. I love it.
I got to tell you,
you are my child now.
We, as gay people,
like I said before,
we get to choose the families.
We create families on our own
on this journey,
and all of my girls--you--
all of the girls
on this stage and the girls
in the audience,
we are one big, happy family,
and we will all be
there for one another.
Promises? Okay.
[cheers and applause]
-<i> We are seconds away</i>
<i>from finding out</i>
<i>which one of these</i>
<i>fabulous queens</i>
<i>will be crowned</i>
<i>America's next drag superstar.</i>
-<i> Can't get enough of my girls?</i>
<i>Then have I got</i>
<i>a mobile game for you:</i>
<i>Rupaul's Drag Race Dragopolis.</i>
<i>Oh, my goodness!</i>
<i>Work it out, boss lady.</i>
<i>Work it.</i>
<i>Serving glamour!</i>
<i>Available now on iTunes.</i>
[laughs]
[cheers and applause]
Welcome back to<i> RuPaul's</i>
<i>Drag Race Reunited.</i>
Alaska, Jinkx, Roxxxy,
one of you
is just moments away
from being crowned
America's next drag superstar.
Now, if, for any reason,
our queen is unable
to perform her duties,
Coco Montrese
has graciously volunteered
to finish out your reign.
[cheers and applause]
Too much?
Is it--was it too soon
for that joke?
- No!
- No!
- Now, I want to give
a shout-out
to my two best squirrel friends,
Santino Rice
and Michelle Visage.
[cheers and applause]
Can you smell me?
- Yes.
- Any last words?
- Your sequence brocog gown
is real "eloguent."
- [laughs]
- Yes.
- Are you ready?
both: Good luck,
and don't fuck it up.
- [laughing]
Thank you, thank you.
Now, ladies, whoever snatches
the crown tonight
will be standing
on the shoulders
of five legendary champions.
Please welcome the<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>

a luxury trip, courtesy of
ALandCHUCK.travel,
headline Logo's<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> tour,</i>

[cheers and applause]
The time has come

As always, I have consulted
with the judges and the fans,
but the final decision
is mine to make.
Alaska.
Jinkx Monsoon.
Roxxxy Andrews.
The winner
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race,</i>
America's next drag superstar
is...

[cheers and applause]
Condragulations.
[cheers and applause]
Now prance, my queen.
Do you have anything
you'd like to say?
- Get ready, bitches,
'cause it's Monsoon season.
- [laughs]
[cheers and applause]
I love it.
Great, everybody.
Thank you so much.
If you can't love yourself,
how in the hell you gonna love
somebody else?
Can I get an "amen" in here?
all: Amen!
- All right.


-<i> My next drag superstars</i>
<i>had one thing in common.</i>
<i>They were all busted...</i>
<i>And found guilty...</i>
[gavel bangs]
<i>Of being sickening...</i>
Order in the courtroom,
hunties!
<i>A new trial begins,</i>
<i>as 14 queens prove</i>
<i>they can dance...</i>

Holy shit, we're here.
<i>My name is Detox,</i>

<i>I can do everything.</i>
<i>I act, I sing, I rap, I dance.</i>
Let's send the rest
of these clowns home.
Where is everybody?
<i>I've worked</i>
<i>with huge celebrities</i>

Mash!
Are you kidding?
[both screaming]
<i>Me and Detox started drag</i>
<i>together,</i>
and I'm just so excited
to see her.
You look gorge.
- You too.
-<i> I am a pageant girl--</i>
<i>big hair, big makeup.</i>
From head to toe,
it's a Roxxxy Andrews project.
It all begins.
- Hey, girls, hey!

-<i> My name is Alyssa Edwards,</i>
and I am 32 years of age.
<i>I'm known as</i>

Girl, I am gagging.
<i>I am here</i>

I still got it.
I need to get up in this gear,

all: Hi!
-<i> My name is Jinkx Monsoon.</i>
<i>I'm 24,</i>
and I'm Seattle's

Hi!
- Swimsuit competition.
-<i> I'm theatrically trained</i>
in the Broadway
school of singing.
- Ooh!
- Okay, Detox,
with the feathers.
- I don't know
about that Jinkx yet.
She's a little kooky.
- Pfft!
- Hello, boys!
<i>My name's Penny Tration,</i>
<i>and I am 39 years old.</i>
I'm here because I was chosen
by thousands of people
in the online voting contest.
- You're the web vote?
- You guys should be happy
to know
that everybody actually
wanted me here.
[laughter]
I hope that me being voted on
the show by a lot of people
<i>makes the other queens</i>
<i>really intimidated.</i>
- Hey, y'all.
- Hello.
- Whoo!
- Ohh!
We got another one.
-<i> My name is Vivienne Pinay.</i>
I'm 26 years old.
- You're giving me
pinup Kat Von D doll.
- Thank you.
Vivienne is all about glamour.
My beauty is everything.
-<i> Vivienne's cute,</i>
but I'm cuter.

- Oh, my God.
- Who is it?
- [imitates horse whinny]
- Uh...
- Hi!
- Oh, shit.
- Wow.
-<i> My name is Alaska,</i>

<i>And I also have</i>
<i>a very famous boyfriend</i>
<i>whose name is Sharon Needles.</i>
- Sharon's girlfriend.
Girl/boyfriends.
- Oh.
-<i> In this competition, dating</i>
the previous winner
<i>is definitely uncharted</i>
<i>territory.</i>
- This trash bag couture is
something else.
- Yes. It's a plastic
tablecloth.
-<i> Alaska definitely has</i>
big shoes to fill.
- Hey, sisters.
all: Whoa!
- My name is Honey Mahogany.
<i>And I'm 28 years old.</i>
How are you?
-<i> Honey Mahogany</i>
<i>is like</i>
<i>a</i><span style="bodyStyle"> RuPaul Drag Race</i><i> poster.</i>
<i>But not quite as polished.</i>
- I think I'm the first queen
from San Francisco, actually.
- Hello, hippie!
- People get down on
San Francisco
for being a bunch of hippies.
<i>But there's so much beauty</i>
<i>there.</i>
Have you seen Honey Mahogany?
[laughs]
- Uh-oh!
- Hey, hey, hey, ladies!
Aah!
Oh, my God!
My name is Ivy Winters.
I'm 25 years old.
- Your top is awesome.
- Thank you.
- It's so well-tailored.
- I make dresses
out of cassette tape,
<i>paper cups, condoms.</i>
I will figure out a way
to turn it into a costume.
And I used to work as a clown
for like eight years.
- Well, you still do.
[laughter]
- Hello, girls.
I'm Monica Beverly Hillz,
with a Z.
<i>I'm 27.</i>
Monica Beverly Hillz
is very good at giving face.
This might be the fishiest
season ever, darling.
- I know!
-<i> I have been called</i>
ghetto, banji, trashy.
<i>I was raised in the ghetto.</i>
<i>You know, I'm street smart.</i>
And there's nothing wrong
with that.
- Oh! Look at this!
-<i> I'm Lineysha Sparx,</i>
<i>and I am 24 years old.</i>
Lineysha is so fierce,

<i>I'm very excited to be here</i>

<i>Lineysha's in the house,</i>
so watch out, bitches.
- How many more girls?
This has to be it, right?
- This has to be it.
- Lucky 13.
- This is 13?
- Oh, boys!
The diva has arrived!
I'm Coco Montrese,
and I'm 37 years old.
[all screaming]
[dramatic chorus]
- And then walks in
Coco Montrese...
<i>the face-crack of the century.</i>
- Oh, my God!
Alyssa Edwards.
What the fuck?
Oh, Alyssa Edwards...again.
- Here she goes.
- What's the story?
- Alyssa, you wanna tell
the story,
or you want me to tell
the story?
- There's no story.
- What's the story?
- We haven't spoke in two years.
<i>The pageant tore our friendship</i>
<i>apart.</i>
- We were close, and I feel like
I was bamboozled.
- Coco was the one
backstabbing me behind my back.
- Alyssa and I will have
our moment later together,
'cause we need a moment.
I don't think she wants to talk
about it...
but we're gonna talk about it.
If she doesn't go home first.
-<i> "Game on, bitch,"</i>
the sequel.
[siren]
-<i> Ooh, girl, you got shemail!</i>
[cheering]
<i>Welcome, my queens.</i>
<i>I told you California</i>
<i>was the place you oughta be.</i>
<i>So you tightened up your tuck</i>
<i>and you flew to Beverly...</i>
<i>Hills.</i>
<i>Adjacent, that is.</i>
[laughter]
<i>So whether you're</i>
<i>a fresh princess of Bel-Air,</i>
<i>a Malibu Barbie,</i>
<i>or just serving</i>

<i>to get your big break</i>
<i>in RuPaullywood, you need</i>
<i>to make an even bigger splash</i>
<i>and really shake things up.</i>
<i>Oh...oh, my goodness!</i>
<i>An earthquake!</i>
<i>Oh, my God! My hair!</i>
<i>Ooh!</i>
<i>I think it's the big one.</i>
<i>Ooh! Ooh, faster, faster!</i>
<i>Ooh!</i>
<i>Slower, slower, slower.</i>
<i>Oh!</i>
<i>Cut!</i>
<i>[sighs]</i>
<i>Remember, to snatch this crown,</i>
<i>you need to fake it</i>
<i>until you make it.</i>
[cheering]
Hello, hello, hello.
[all screaming]
Welcome to<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
- Yes!
- Now, I chose each of you
because I see in you the raw
charisma, uniqueness, nerve,
and talent that it takes to go
all the way.
In addition to winning
the title
of America's next
drag superstar,
the champion
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i>
will receive a lifetime supply
of Color Evolution cosmetics,
a one-of-a-kind trip
courtesy of ALandCHUCK.travel,
and headline Logo's
Outrageous Drag Race Tour,
featuring Absolut Vodka,
cocktails perfected.
And some cash money, honey.
[cheering]
Yes, child.
To the tune of $100,000.
[cheering, chatter]
-<i> Well, I feel so excited.</i>
It's 100,000 of dollars!
And I want to win that money.
- No more kiddin' around,
girls.
You're in the enter-taint-ment
capital of the world.
- Yes!
- And to make it in
RuPaullywood,
you've gotta dive
in the deep end.
Are you ready for your close-up?
<i>Coming up...</i>
[slow-motion scream]
<i>[laughing]</i>
<i>[laughing]</i>
[upbeat music]
Hi, Jade.
- Hey, Ru.
<i>It's time for our first</i>
<i>photo shoot.</i>
<i>I am eager to see</i>
<i>what the challenge is,</i>
and I am super-nervous.
- What do you think is going on
right now?
- Um...[giggling]
I'm not sure.
- Well, turn around.
- Oh! [laughs]
Oh, my gosh.
Talk about the elephant
in the room.
Didn't see that.
[laughing]
- Now, say hello to the amazing
Mike Ruiz.
Mike is here to shoot
your Hollywood splash photo.
What we're looking for
is underwater serving glamour.
- Like, give us fish.
- [laughs] Awesome.
- Let's do it.
- Today we're doing an homage
to old Hollywood
that's kind of a tribute
to old Esther Williams films.
- Please note that there's
no pee in the water.
- [laughing]
- All right, hit it!
- Jade Jolie,
you're soaking in it.
- Try not to look like
you're holding your breath.
Jade would inhale
a bunch of air
and would hold it all
in her cheeks like a chipmunk.
That doesn't make for
a very pretty glamour shot.
She's giving me parrot fish.
- I was giving Helen Keller
drowning realness.
<i>[laughs]</i>
- Ooh! Wet and wild.
Roxxxy Andrews!
Hit it.
- Acrobatic, graceful,
gorgeous face, glamour.
- Ooh, she's rolling
in the deep!
- Do it.
- On the Roxxxy with a splash.
Detox!
- Give us everything
you've got.
Yes!
It's the bumble fish.
- Aquawomana!
Oh, gorgeous!
- Gorgeous.
- Detox fell off the wagon
and into the pool.
Serena ChaCha!
The time has come for you
to sink...for your life!
- For my life.
-<i> Uno, dos, tres!</i>
Oops. Uh-oh.
- Oh, dear.
I can see your seafood platter!
Your paella is showing!
- At least Serena
was wearing panties.
Okay.
- Okay, there's a pole.
- Hold on to the pole.
Lookit.
It looks like frog legs.
[RuPaul laughing]
- What the fuck
was that about, guys?
- It's not
your<i> quinceanera</i><span style="bodyStyle"> anymore, is it?</i>
- Your<i> quinceanera</i><span style="bodyStyle"> is ruined!</i>
- By a pool.
- I'm not tucked.
- Oh, you didn't tuck?
- I'm not tucked at all,
so the dress is doing this
the whole time.
- Showing all your bubblegum
and everything.
- See, you thought you were
being cutesie
by being comfortable
with your non-tuck,
and they got you together.
<i>I'm not a fan of girls</i>
<i>who don't tuck.</i>
<i>Look like a woman.</i>
It's female impersonation
at the end of the day.
- Deeper!
Don't be so shallow, Alyssa.
Your legs look like calamari
when you do that.
- Okay.
- Dance underwater.
Is that dress wash and wear?
- Whew!
- Careful on these
wet, slippery surfaces.
Oh!
Queen down.
- At least I did it gracefully.
- Very.
- Jinkx Monsoon, welcome to
the drag lagoon!
- I don't know how to swim.
I learned how to swim
by one of my uncles
pushing me off a log
into a river.
First time under the water,
I lost both my contacts.
I was blinded within seconds.
- Okay, you look a little scared
underwater.
- A more pretty face.
- Okay, too much splashing.
Uh-oh.
You're splashing aroun--oops.
- [gasping]
- Are you okay?
- Just a little tang--
[spits] Tangled.
- I think we're gonna
have to call it a wrap.
- Jinkx, there's got to be
a morning after.
Deeper, Penny Tration.
Girl, you're gonna put
Shelley Winters out of work.
- [laughs]
- Oh, wait a minute.
- And go.
- Yes, yes, yes!
<i>Poseidon Adventure,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> darling.</i>
- Hit it!
- Serving "Wettie" Page.
- Yes!
- Touch all of the skin.
The filet of Vivienne Pinay.
Oh, Alaska's underwater.
Damn you, global warming!
- Oh!
- Okay. Yeah, your head's not
going very deep.
- And keep your hair
out of your face.
- I can't get deep enough.
I don't know how to do it.
- Alaska--she got really
frustrated, and it showed.
Push yourself down.
Go!
No.
Nope--on your face.
- Oh!
- All right, all right.
- I can't do it.
I failed.
- We will offer you one more dip
if you wanna take it.
- I'm sorry.
That was terrible!
[laughter]
I can't believe that.
I'm in shock.
I did so bad!
I don't know how to swim.
- Oh, get that.
-<i> I've completely blown it.</i>
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
- It's Honey Mahogany!
Honey, I sunk the kids.
Ooh! That was pretty.
Ivy Winters!
Throwing caution to the wind.
Fishy when wet.
Monica Beverly Hillz.
- Push your dress down
when you get underwater.
- You look like a jellyfish.
In the future, you should
hand-wash your woolens.
Oh...yes!
- All right!
Lineysha's body language
was so incredibly graceful
and dancerly;
it was amazing.
- Sparkle, Lineysha, sparkle!
Sorry to say, that satin will
never be the same.
Work!
Coco Montrese!
Chicken of the sea!
Serving "Tuna" Turner.
- Relax your face.
- Yes, mama.
Instant Coco--just add water.
- Okay, y'all, somebody forgot
to tell them...
- [laughs]
- That black people don't swim.
[laughter]
Thank God I'm Dominican.
- Oh.
- Y'all look cute.
- Seeing everybody de-dragging
for the very first time
is always exciting.
Detox--immediately, I'm like,
"Work done!"
- [smacking]
-<i> Lineysha</i>
<i>is the Puerto Rican papi.</i>
Oh, my gosh.
- Jinkx out of drag, uh...
Why does she have
an eye patch?
What is going on?
Oh, my God!
- I saw you sleeping earlier.
I was like, "Maybe she's just
really tired."
- I have narcolepsy.
So if I don't like stay active,
I start to slunk,
and then it's a whole big mess.
- Wait, Miss Thing.
So you fall asleep
out of nowhere?
- It's not how they do it
in the movies.
You know, like,
you can feel it coming on,
and if you're lucky, you make
your way to a sofa and...
[laughs]
- Jinkx is a special person.
- I am Seattle's premier
Jewish narcoleptic drag queen.
Thank you.
I'm not gonna make an excuse
for it.
<i>I wear my narcolepsy</i>
<i>as a badge of pride.</i>
<i>It's something I've had to...</i>
[snoring]
- [clears throat]
- Yes!
[all cheering]
- Thank you, Mr. Handsome.
- I know what I wanna drink.
- Hello, hello, hello!
[all cheering]
Um...who are you guys?
[laughter]
Now, Mike and I have reviewed
your photos,
and some of you were in
over your heads.
- Yes!
- But some of you took to it
like a fish to water.
- Fish!
- The one queen that surfaced
as the clear winner is...
Detox.
[all cheering]
-<i> I was floored.</i>
<i>I may sit around and Kiki</i>
<i>with everybody,</i>
<i>but at the end of the day,</i>
I'm here for one reason,
and that's to win.
- Detox, I love your photo
so much,
I'm tweeting it right now.
#RuPaullywood.
- Yeah, that's right!
- Ladies, take a moment
to unwind.
Because tomorrow,
your RuPaullywood adventure
continues with a Beverly Hills
shopping spree.
- Oh!
[cheering]
- I'm thrilled at the aspect
of going on a shopping spree.
- Let's go.
- Adios!
all: Bye!
- But I'm pretty sure
it's not gonna be
the shopping spree
that we imagine.
-<i> Coming up...</i>
- What's going on?
- Oh!
- Oh, my God!
- And where is my damn
shopping spree?
[all shouting]
- Wait!
- Mommy!
-<i> [laughing]</i>
<i>[laughing]</i>
-<i> So today RuPaul</i>
<i>is sending us</i>
<i>on a exclusive tour</i>
<i>of RuPaullywood,</i>
<i>which culminates in a special</i>
Beverly Hills shopping spree.
[horn honks]
- Wait!
-<i> I'm getting my life</i>
<i>on this bus.</i>
<i>Celebrities waving back.</i>
Oh, my gosh, it's like a dream
come true.
[all gasping and cheering]
- Hello, ladies.
Hi!
- Who comes out the door
but Camille Grammer
from<i> The Real Housewives.</i>
<i>Are you kidding me?</i>
- Welcome to Beverly Hills.
[all cheering]
We've been expecting you.
But you can't come in here.
- Oh...
- RuPaul is waiting for you
at the VIP entrance...
that way.
- Oh!
- Over there?
- Wait. What?
-<i> Ciao,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> darlings.</i>
Mwah!
- We love you, Camille!
- [mouthing]
Call me.
- Whoo!
- So we walk around the store
to meet RuPaul.
<i>We're looking,</i>
<i>and we see a gate.</i>
- Oh!
What is this?
-<i> We see dumpsters</i>
<i>and an alien from outer space.</i>
<i>What's going on?</i>
And where's my damn
shopping spree?
- Girl...
[suspenseful music]
- Well, hey, pretty womens.
[laughing, chatter]
Welcome to the slums
of Beverly Hills.
- Hey!
- Now, I promised you
a shopping spree, but, girl,
Beverly Hills boutiques
can be so darn...
But I know where you can get
a real bargain!
These dumpsters are overflowing
with some of the most exclusive
garbage in the 90210.
For your first main challenge,
you need to create
an award-winning look
that screams "Hollywood
red carpet couture," darling.
You'll have just one minute
to dumpster dive.
And, ladies...
all sales are final.
[chuckles]
-<i> Oh, my God.</i>
We're dumpster diving
for materials.
Great, it's a challenge.
- Gentlemen,
start your engines,
and may the best woman win.
[rock music]
[all exclaiming, yelling]
- I'm trying to get
everything I can.
<i>Girls pushing and prodding</i>
<i>and jumping on top of my head.</i>
Ow!
That's my leg.
This is crazy, honey.
- Out of my way! Oh!
- The girl next to me
throws the lid up...
[slow-motion voices]
I won't make it out of this
competition alive.
[laughs]
- Oh! My garbage!
[overlapping chatter]
- I can't get out of here!
- Ay, damn!
Penny Tration smacked my face,
honey.
My moneymaker!
I was pissed.
Don't knock me over.
- Don't knock you over?
This pushy little queen
over here getting on my nerves!
<i>I am not afraid</i>
<i>to shove my way</i>
through the little girls...
Mommy!
And get what I need to get.
- I am gagged,
and not in the good way.
- I got a steal!
- Five-finger discount.
Mm-hmm.
- Ooh!
- All right.
Let's get to work.
- Shopping spree,
shopping spree.
No credit card involved.
<i>We entered back</i>
<i>into the workroom,</i>
and it was time to get to work.
- Whoo, girl!
- Fabulous.
- What are you wearing, Roxxxy?
- This is my makeup dress.
- Why?
- Because I take my makeup off
in it.
Oh, y'all can't take me?
Oh, y'all cannot take
my fishy daytime dress.
- Miss Alaska,
put some clothes on, please.
- First one naked!
- Tucka-tucka-tucka-tucka!
- Look at this.
-<i> The reason she walked in</i>
<i>the room with a horse face...</i>
was 'cause she is a horse.
- Talk about letting it all
hang out, darling.
- Bitch, I live for this.
- Oh, my God,
how did you get that?
- What is that?
- Miss Thang!
- You found that?
- She hit the jackpot!
We got the winner.
- I am happy with what I got
from the dumpster.
I found fabulous
red sequined fabric.
- Ooh, girl,
you got paillettes!
- Mister sisters over here.
- Mister sister?
- Mister sisters.
- Mister sisters?
- Mister sisters.
- It's so funny.
As soon as she pulled out
all them red paillettes,
you are now her best friend.
She's trying to take
Miss Thing's fabric.
She can't be bothered
right now.
- She got Miss Thing
to cut it up.
- What are they talking about
over there?
- Jade, be careful, girl.
- Be careful with her.
- Why you say be careful
to me, Miss Coco?
- Just be careful.
That's all I'm saying.
- Here she comes.
- Miss Jade.
Find out who your real friends
are,
and you stick by
your real friends.
- Girl, you're my real friend,
bitch.
- I'm not saying Alyssa's not.
- You can meet your friends'
longevity, right?
'Cause we've been in
competition.
- We have been in a lot of
competitions.
- And at the end of the day,
it's like you really, truly find
who your friends are
in the end.
- Yeah. That's true.
- That's what it's about.
- So we'll talk about it later,
Alyssa.
- We don't got nothing
to talk about.
- We do have--we have a lot to
talk about.
You say you'll find out later
who your friends are.
So you and I will sit down
and talk about that.
- I wanna know what the fuck
happened.
- When are you gonna tell me?
- Not gonna answer that.
When I'm ready.
-<i> I'm definitely feeling</i>
<i>the pressure because</i>
I floundered
in the dunk tank.
<i>So hopefully, I can redeem</i>
<i>myself.</i>
-<i> Alaska's a one-trick pony</i>
<i>at this point,</i>
<i>because yet again,</i>
she's making another dress
out of plastic bags.
- Saran Wrap?
<i>It's red carpet, honey.</i>
This might get you
on the bottom two.
Good luck.
-<i> Coming up...</i>
- I just wanted to keep it
kinda classy.
- Yeah.
There's a lot of influences
there.
- This is my plastic
evening gown.
I just see it in my brain.
- Okay.
-<i> I hope it's couture</i>
enough.
- [laughing]
- I need like wire cutters.
<i>This week's main challenge</i>
is making dumpster
red carpet couture.
- Where's some pins,
straight pins?
- I don't know.
-<i> The workroom's really tense</i>
<i>at the moment,</i>
'cause everyone's designing
their first runway look.
And it's important to make
a first impression.
- Everyone's all quiet.
That means you guys are
stressed.
-<i> Being an artist,</i>
I feel like the best thing
to do is just, you know,
concentrate on your concept,
chew as much as you can chew,
and you hope that whatever
you spit out comes out right.
-<i> Serena's going very slow.</i>
<i>She's doing this and that,</i>
<i>but there's just kind of</i>
<i>no product being made.</i>
And time's ticking down.
- Hello, hello, hello!
all: Hi!
- Now, is this the real
drag queens of Beverly Hills?
all: Yes!
- Yes, ma'am.
- Well, hello, Coco Montrese.
- Hi, Ru.
- Now, this outfit...
- I want to give
Debbie Reynolds...
Marilyn Monroe
meets Madonna.
I just wanted to keep it
kind of classy.
- Yeah.
Well, there's a lot of
influences there.
-<i> I don't wanna play it safe.</i>
<i>One way or another,</i>
I need to stand out.
<i>So take it or leave it,</i>
<i>this is me tomorrow,</i>
and I'm gonna turn it.
- I know that you have a history
with Alyssa.
Has it gotten in the way so far
in the competition?
- It...kinda threw me.
<i>This Alyssa situation</i>
is a distraction for me
right now.
<i>And I need to put it aside</i>
<i>and focus on</i>
what Coco's gonna present.
- All right, Coco.
- Thank you.
- You're taking a risk,
and I love it, so go for it.
- Thanks, Ru.
- Serena ChaCha.
- Hi, Ru.
- How long have you been
doing drag?
- For three years.
Just turned 21,
just graduated art school.
I do performance art.
- Performance art.
- Yeah.
- Now, do you sew?
- Yes, but there is
a new art movement
called soft sculpture.
It's more about creating
a sculpture
rather than just tailoring.
- Well, that sounds great
on paper,
but what does it look like?
- It looks like this.
- That scares me.
- I'm trying to do detail
first,
just like when you paint.
- There's not a lot of time
here, you know.
- A little scared about that.
- And there's not a lot of dress
over here either.
- No, it's still really abstract
right now,
but I know it's gonna
come together.
-<i> Serena said she went</i>
<i>to art school.</i>
She might want her money back.
- I'm just surprised that
you're so calm and collected,
you know?
There's a lot of experienced
queens here
who are a little further along
in their execution
of their couture outfit.
-<i> All I have to do is come up</i>
<i>with a whole</i>
performative aspect for my
dress, and I'm totally calm.
I know this is gonna work out.
I totally do.
- Well, listen, I know you got
a lot of work to do here.
I can tell.
- I do.
- So get back to it.
- Okay, I will.
Thank you, Ru, I appreciate it.
- All right.
Roxxxy Andrews!
- RuPaul!
- Look at you, girl!
- Girl, I'm rushing.
- Do you sew?
- I do sew.
You know, losing weight
when I was a kid,
you know, I had to take
a lot of my clothes in
'cause we didn't have
a lot of money.
- Now, have you recently lost
a lot of weight?
- I did lose.
I've lost like 70 pounds.
- 70 pounds?
- 70 pounds.
- And how has that affected
the way you dress
and the way you feel?
- Well, girl, now I show
a little more body
than I used to be able to.
I used to be in eight corsets,
ten girdles and not being able
to breathe.
I used to be a big-ger girl.
<i>But I still consider myself</i>
<i>a girl</i>
<i>who's got a little meat</i>
<i>on her bones.</i>
And whether you're juicy, fat,
whatever,
embrace what you got
and work with it.
- You're not a big girl.
You're a thick girl.
- I'm a thick--I'm juicy.
- Oh, okay!
All right, I'm down with that.
- Right?
- Listen, I'm gonna let you get
back to work here.
- Thank you, Ru.
- Thank you.
Penny Tration!
- RuPaul!
- Hi!
You are our fan favorite.
The fans chose you.
- I know.
Which is amazing to me.
I now have a true respect
for politicians.
All the begging and the pleading
and the votes.
- So tell me what you're doing.
The silhouette has sort of
a drop waist.
- Yes, what I have
is this crazy torso,
so what I try and do
is elongate it a bit,
bring it down to my knees,
and then--
- You bring your torso down
to your knees?
- Well, ish.
Make the length come down here.
- Uh-huh.
Well, you know, you were very
enterprising
in your campaigning
to get here,
so you've gotta be able
to translate that
into your couture outfit.
- Yes.
<i>I am going for</i>
a look that is more classic.
<i>Penny Tration is not Lady Gaga</i>
and nor does she wanna be.
- Bring it, mama.
- I'll do my best.
- All right.
- Thanks, Ru.
- Get to work.
The 49th state!
Alaska.
- Hi.
- You're finally here.
- I know, yay!
- How many times have you
auditioned for this show?
- Um, every time that
you're allowed to
and sometimes when you're not
even accepting applications.
- Well, you've worked so hard
to get here for so many years,
and then I was a little bit
surprised that, in the tank,
you sort of kind of gave up.
I just want to encourage you
to just go for it
every single time.
Now, tell me, what are you
working on?
- This is my plastic
evening gown.
- Uh-huh.
- I didn't wanna shy away
from making it look
like it came out
of a dumpster.
- Well, the challenge
is to turn trash into flash.
-<i> Ru is looking at this</i>
<i>a little funny,</i>
<i>and I know I'm taking a risk.</i>
<i>I hope it's couture</i>
enough.
I just see it in my brain.
- Yeah. Okay.
I'm gonna let you
get back to work.
- Thank you.
- All right.
All right, ladies, gather round.
Now, tomorrow, for your
RuPaullywood premiere,
our extra-special guest judges
will be my old friend
Mike Ruiz...
- Yes!
- And from<i> The Real Housewives</i>
<i>of Beverly Hills,</i>
your new BFF, Camille Grammer.
[cheering]
And you only get one chance
to make a first impression.
So don't fuck it up.
<i>Coming up...</i>
-<i> Little bitty Serena--</i>
she's fucking irritating
the shit out of me.
- I have a feeling you just
like to be the only pretty one.
- You're so immature, it's just
really aggravating.
- [laughing]
- Oh!
- Here we go.
Let's get to work, ladies.
-<i> Today is our first</i>
<i>elimination.</i>
Somebody's going home.
Somebody's lip syncing
for their life,
<i>and it's kinda scary.</i>
- That's a lot of unique pieces
of couture clothing.
- I'm finna' get
all nasty rich!
You think Michelle
would like that?
Just pearls hanging off
her boobs, baby.
- Very you.
Very you.
- She likes to come over
and try to throw me off.
She used to do that when
we were in competition.
- Don't worry.
She thinks that
she is very fashion,
but she dresses like a Dracula.
- How are you feeling?
- I am, you know,
back and forth
between nervous and excited.
- I'm not nervous at all.
I don't know if I should feel
bad for it
or if I should feel nervous
about not being nervous.
- I always go by,
if you're not nervous,
then there's something wrong.
- Time to put on<i> Little House</i>
<i>on the Prairie.</i>
Category is "daytime realness."
- I see your
Laura Ingalls Wilder,
and I give you Africa.
- She's Africa, all right.
She's a muumuu.
[laughter]
- Look, guys, it's a picture
of me and Noodles!
- Aw, Noodles.
- I miss her so much.
- Um, Alaska, who's the top,
and who's the bottom?
- Is it competitive
with you guys being together?
Are you guys competitive
against each other?
- Are you guys jealous
of each other?
- Were you bitter last year?
- Go on, don't lie.
You can tell the truth.
- We have so many questions.
- I would have been.
- Is it difficult?
- I mean, we--we have fights,
'cause it's two giant egos
in one tiny house, so...
- And isn't Sharon the superstar
of the relationship now?
- We had some difficult times
last year.
It was very hard.
- Like when she was gone
or like before she even left?
- Before she left, while she
was gone, after she got back.
We fought viciously
about her getting on
<i>Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> and me not.</i>
I felt pain and rejection like
I've never felt in my life.
But as soon as that promo aired
for last year, like showing who
the cast was,
I just burst into tears...
- Aw!
- And I was like,
"I'm so proud of her."
- That's so sweet.
- Yeah, that's really classy.
- I had to choose:
Am I gonna be bitter
or become her biggest fan?
And I made the right choice.
- That's classy.
- But at the same time,
you're an artist,
so that must have been
difficult.
[dramatic note]
- Yeah.
<i>I feel the pressure,</i>
<i>seeing as Sharon just won</i>
<i>this competition.</i>
<i>It's a huge insecurity of mine.</i>
[sighs]
If I was the first to go home,
I would be absolutely
just devastated.
<i>I would feel like I'd</i>
let my family down
and let myself down.
[upbeat music]
- [off-key]
- Okay.
- All right.
- That was just right next
to my ear.
- That one's gonna bug me--
that little one.
She's already starting to bug.
Little bitty Serena--
<i>she's kinda irritating,</i>
<i>and by "kinda,"</i>
I mean she's fucking irritating
the shit out of me...
<i>on a constant.</i>
- I was born and raised
in the republic of Panama.
- Where is Panama?
- It's in between Colombia
and Costa Rica.
It's one of the number one
retirement homes for Americans.
You should consider
going there.
- Not if they're all like you.
all: Ooh!
- Yeah, 'cause your mouth
doesn't shut.
- Oh, okay.
- It wears thin very quickly.
- You know, I have a feeling
you just like to be
the only pretty one.
- I just think you're annoying.
- I can handle annoying.
- I can't.
<i>Serena tries to read bitches</i>
like she can.
<i>She is loud,</i>
<i>she won't shut her mouth,</i>
and I have had it with her.
- There's funny, and there's
just like blunt rudeness.
- Can you not take it?
Is that why?
- Oh, honey, I can take it.
You're just, like, so immature,
it's just really aggravating.
- I'm sorry.
You're only 21 once,
and you only audition
for this thing once being 21
and get in right away once.
- And then you think
because you're younger,
you think that's an advantage,
when we've all done drag
longer, so...
- Does it bother you
I keep saying I'm 21?
- Well, no, not at all, I mean,
because honestly,
I look just as young as you,
but you just--
- Are you sure about that?
- Ooh!
- Easy!
- Girl, you ain't that pretty.
Cover girl,
don't cover boy, baby.
- Go home, Jade.
Go home.
Just go home.
Well, girls, we will see.
- We shall see.
- [laughing]
Welcome to the main stage
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
From Jersey to L.A.,
it's my bi-coastal buddy
Michelle Visage.
- Can you believe
it's season five?
- Wow!
- Gorgeous.
- And my favorite leading man,
Santino Rice.
- You've come a long way, baby.
- Welcome, darling.
And fab photographer Mike Ruiz.
- What's up?
- And the very glamorous
Camille Grammer is here!
- Hello, Ru.
- Now, I hear they're letting
drag queens shop
in Beverly Hills.
- Oh, Ru, we've been doing that
for years.
[laughter]
- This week, it's a classic tale
of drags to riches
as we challenged our queens
to turn Beverly Hills trash
into Tinseltown class.
Now they're ready to make
their RuPaullywood
red carpet debut.
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.
-<i> Coming up...</i>
- The shape is all wrong
for you.
You're gonna get lost in it.
- It was makeup for me.
It was just awful.
- Make a silhouette
and perfect it.
- Hello.
- Is that too much to ask?
- [laughing]
- Commence shake...down.
First up, the queen on
everyone's lips--
Roxxxy Andrews.
Foxy Roxxxy.
- Ooh,
and the hips don't lie.
- Aww...
-<i> I'm walking down the runway,</i>
<i>giving them a little bit of hip</i>
<i>and body--bam!</i>
<i>This is exactly what I would</i>
<i>wear to an awards show.</i>
- All that ass.
- Like to spend a night
in the Roxxxy.
- She has a huge opening...
weekend.
And her box office
ain't bad either.
[laughter]
Jinkx Monsoon.
- I'm ready for my close-up,
Mr. Demille.
-<i> I'm serving 100% aquamarine</i>
<i>Grecian red carpet couture.</i>
<i>I am in heaven right now.</i>
- I dream of Jinkx.
- Loofah, my ass!
[laughter]
Detox on the red carpet.
Oh, it's severe up in here.
- Well, now we know where
last season's backdrop went.
- Yes!
-<i> I'm serving</i>
<i>Jem and the Holograms,</i>
<i>acid punk,</i>
<i>going to the Met gala,</i>
<i>and I feel really sexy</i>
<i>and gorgeous.</i>
- Just another day in Hollywood.
She's detoxing from crack,
by the way.
[laughter]
Ivy Winters!
The ladyboy in red.
-<i> I feel really amazing</i>
<i>because I know that</i>
<i>the garment</i>
<i>is completely hand-stitched,</i>
<i>and it's Hollywood</i>
<i>red carpet couture.</i>
- Isn't she giving Jean Kasem
and...
- And Janice Dickinson.
- Janice Dickinson.
- Yes.
- Let's have lunch at the Ivy.
For your consideration,
Honey Mahogany.
- LaBeija.
-<i> I'm serving Iman,</i>
<i>and I'm stomping my heart out</i>
<i>down the runway.</i>
- The men love me,
the women love me.
[laughter]
- You can catch more flies with
Honey Mahogany.
Jade Jolie.
- I can see her
peacock-cock-cock.
- [imitates NBC chimes]
[laughter]
-<i> I'm serving the judges up</i>
<i>red sequins in your face.</i>
<i>[giggles]</i>
<i>I am a million bucks,</i>
<i>and nothing can bring me down</i>
<i>right now.</i>
- Here's lookin' at you, kid.
Alyssa Edwards.
Wow.
- She's all about the drama.
- It's very drama-filled.
- The bird flew the coop
on this one.
- Yes.
-<i> I'm serving dark and twisted</i>
<i>Alyssa Edwards realness.</i>
<i>My blood is flowing</i>
<i>and my heart is pumping,</i>
<i>and my mind is in it</i>
<i>to win it.</i>
- Somebody took the Black Swan
and mated with the matador.
- And now we've got bird flu.
- Yes.
Penny Tration.
- [laughs]
Yes, please.
- Penny for your thoughts.
-<i> I'm walking slow and letting</i>
<i>them take</i>
<i>all the Penny Tration in.</i>
<i>And I make sure</i>
<i>they can get to see</i>
<i>the backside of Penny Tration.</i>
- You better sissy that walk,
girl.
- All right!
- You better sissy that walk.
- Hey!
- I wonder if she has a twin.
She'd be double Penny Tration.
[laughter]
- Coco Montrese.
- Action!
- She is ready for her close-up.
- Somebody blow into those
bullhorns.
- I know.
-<i> I'm booking it down</i>
<i>the runway,</i>
<i>giving it to you.</i>
<i>I am serving you</i>
<i>old Hollywood.</i>
<i>White woman fish, baby!</i>
- Now, she's a drag queen,
but she really wants to direct.
- Don't we all?
You, on top.
- Vivienne Pinay.
- Oh!
- Oooh!
- Cache spokeswoman.
- Uh-huh.
-<i> I'm giving face,</i>
<i>and I'm giving body.</i>
<i>Hands down, I am the fishiest</i>
<i>bitch in this competition.</i>
- Very J.Lo.
- Mwah!
Box office gold.
She's ready
for the casting couch.
The 49th state--Alaska.
all: Oh!
- That's gorgeous.
- Is that a Birkin bag
or a Glad bag?
[laughter]
-<i> So that dress is made of</i>
<i>plastic,</i>
<i>but I am treating it</i>
<i>like the most expensive</i>
<i>couture gown ever.</i>
<i>And I just wiggle my way down</i>
<i>the runway as best I can.</i>
- She must have
a really big dog.
[laughter]
Alaska.
Oh, dear, I can see Russia
from here.
- Is that Sarah Palin
in that dress?
- It's Saran Palin.
[laughter]
Lineysha Sparx.
- Ooh, glamour.
- Balenciaga!
- Yes.
- She's really working it.
- That's how she walks
to the grocery store.
What are you talking about?
-<i> My dress is full extravaganza,</i>
<i>and my design is flawless.</i>
- And she's got a shoe
on her head.
- Oh, yeah!
- She has a foot up
on the others.
- She does, she's pumped up
the volume,
I'll tell you that.
She's got Lisa Vanderpump
on her mind.
[laughter]
Monica Beverly Hillz.
- Ooh! Look at those legs.
Legs forever!
-<i> I'm feeling extra,</i>
<i>extra fishy.</i>
<i>My legs are bronzed</i>
<i>for the gods,</i>
<i>and I'm just eating it all up.</i>
- She is serving Lady Miss Kier
in the face--you see that?
- Yes, she is, meets Lil Kim.
- Lady Miss Kim.
Serena ChaCha!
- Hey!
- From Panama!
- Panama City, Florida?
- Panama City, Florida...
- Via the Suez Canal.
- Yes.
[laughter]
-<i> Serena ChaCha</i>
<i>is a drag scholar.</i>
<i>I feel avant-garde, couture,</i>
<i>editorial, like some sort of</i>
<i>surreal painting.</i>
<i>I'm giving them something</i>
<i>different.</i>
- It's like Shakira meets...
- Pinocchio?
- Who you calling a lederhosen?
[laughter]
- Cha cha cha!
Welcome, ladies.
Based on your Hollywood splash
photo session
and your red carpet
couture presentation,
I've made some decisions.
When I call your name, please
step forward.
Jinkx Monsoon.
Detox.
Honey Mahogany.
Monica Beverly Hillz.
Vivienne Pinay.
Alyssa Edwards.
Coco Montrese.
To be America's next
drag superstar,
you need to snatch
the world's attention
at every turn.
And unfortunately tonight...
you are...
the S word.
Safe.
- I didn't come to this
competition just to be safe.
<i>I am here to show people</i>
<i>I still got it.</i>
- Anyone who says it's an honor
just to be nominated...
is one lying bitch.
You may leave the stage.
Oh, ladies...
one more thing.
Don't call us.
We'll call you.
That's all.
<i>Coming up...</i>
- I'm wanting to like pull
things off of you
just so I can see more
of who's underneath there.
- What's exposed just looks
like boy.
It was all a mess.
- The time has come...
for you to lip sync...
for your life.
[laughing]
Ladies, you represent the best
and the worst of the week.
It's time for the judges'
critiques.
First up, Roxxxy Andrews.
- Out of all the dresses,
this is the one
that I would be wearing.
Absolutely gorgeous.
- Everything you've done
was just perfect to your curves,
and you revealed enough skin
to keep it classy.
Look at that!
- You just wanna show your ass.
- [laughs]
- I don't know
if you guys noticed,
but when I showed you my shoes,
they're RuPaul shoes.
- I noticed.
- And I found them
in the dumpster.
- What?
- What?
- Who would throw those away?
- I don't know.
- Thank you, Roxxxy.
Next up, Ivy Winters!
- Ivy.
Ooh!
- This dress is absolutely
gorgeous.
You sewed this whole thing?
- I did. I hand-stitched it
completely.
- I was looking at you
and I'm like,
where's the trash?
You kinda have to bring in
some kind of
unconventional material
into this challenge.
- Thank you, Ivy Winters.
Next up, Jade Jolie.
- Hey, Ru, hey!
- You have the sweetest,
softest voice.
- [deep voice] You've never
said that to me, Mike.
[laughter]
- I'm wanting to like pull
things off of you
just so I can see more
of who's underneath there.
There's too many details all
crying out for my attention.
- This is very much my
personality,
kinda like taste
the crazy rainbow kinda girl.
- What does the rainbow
taste like?
- Butterflies and unicorns?
- Yeah. Lisa Frank,
all that good stuff.
- Oh, I love it!
You are just a cute little
thing, aren't you?
- You're a cute little thing.
- I could eat you up
in one bite. Argg!
- All right, thank you, Jade.
Next up, Penny Tration.
What do you got to say for
yourself?
- I'm so glad to be here.
There's a lot to see.
Take a look.
- I think with the dress,
it starts to fall apart
after the bust line.
The left and the right look like
different shapes.
- I just think if you took this
front slit
and made it into a side slit,
I think it would have
been just more flattering.
- One thing I notice is,
your shading is very dark.
Black, dare I say.
- The black on the side looks
like a sideburn almost.
- Next up, Alaska.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Now, did you have any difficulty
putting this outfit together?
- Getting it on my body.
I don't have a zipper.
You can't really sew into
plastic.
- You know, the thing is,
you can take something
that costs nothing
and turn it into something
that looks like
a million dollars.
And you did it tonight.
- Thank you.
- Why no earrings?
- I lost them in the dumpster.
[laughter]
- I like the way you have
accessorized it.
I don't think you need
anything more,
'cause you've got
a lot of shimmer going on
because of the plastic
Saran Wrap.
- Thank you.
- Next up, Lineysha Sparx.
- Puerto Rico in the house.
-<i> Que bella.</i>
This is really elegant.
What is that?
- It's wallpaper, actually.
- Is it really?
- Yes.
- It's brilliant.
- I mean, really impressed
because that is not an easy
thing to work with.
And you made it look
really couture.
- I love the shoe as well
in your hair.
- Yes.
- Repurposed.
- That's really using
your head.
[laughter]
- I love the way you've created
this piece.
- This is because if I need to
do the lip synch,
I can do it like this.
[singing gibberish]
[laughter]
- Thank you, Lineysha.
Serena ChaCha.
-<i> Hola.</i>
- I had a little bit
of an issue
with what you're wearing;
I'm not gonna lie.
The shape is all wrong for you.
You're gonna get lost in it.
And then what's exposed
just looks like boy.
- It looks like you've done
your makeup
in a lighter shade
than your body.
And it almost looks like
if you pulled the head
off of one doll
and put it onto the body of,
like, a G.I. Joe figure.
And this collar really adds this
big weight
around your neck that separates
your head from your body.
- Can I see it without
the neck thing?
- It looks so much prettier.
- I wanna say that I'm open for
all the criticism.
And I'm making sure to put it
toward the next challenge,
whatever that may be.
- All right.
Well, thank you.
Well, ladies, I think we've
heard enough.
While you enjoy
an Absolut cocktail
in the Interior Illusions
lounge,
the judges and I
will deliberate.
You may leave the stage.
All right, kids.
Just between us "goils"...
let's start with Roxxxy Andrews.
- Roxxxy had a very convincing
couture red carpet look
and a great blend of fabrics
and unconventional materials.
- She combined goth with glam.
And I thought she looked great.
- Completely thought-out.
Like she knows what her shape
is all about.
- I do have a con
with Roxxxy Andrews.
I wanted to see more ass.
- [laughs]
- Ivy Winters.
- I mean, the dress
was beautiful.
But I really couldn't stop
looking at her hair
because I just didn't like it,
'cause this gown was
so "elegwent"--
"eloguent."
- You real "eloguent."
- That's my new word.
- You speak "eloguent."
- "Eloguent."
- Talk about couture.
I mean, she hand-stitched
that dress.
- As beautiful as the dress was,
where's the trash?
I didn't get that same kind of
feeling that I get
when I look at Alaska
or Lineysha.
- Lineysha's "eloguent."
- [laughs]
All right, let's move on to
Jade Jolie.
My goodness, Jade Jolie.
She had a lot on.
- I can't really tell where
her taste level is because--
- I think you can.
I think you can.
- She has a very fantastical
sort of outlook on life
about rainbows and unicorns
and all.
But I just don't think
it was very well executed.
- Let's talk about
Penny Tration.
- She came out
with a great attitude.
I get the whole Mae West kinda,
"Come up and see me sometime"
thing going on.
But then you kinda scroll down
a little bit.
- The padding was asymmetrical.
It looked like she had
a tilted pelvis.
Somebody call the osteopath
or something.
- [laughs]
- Make a silhouette
and perfect it.
- Hello.
- Is that too much to ask?
- It is not.
You could be a big girl,
make those proportions
work for you
and actually look couture,
and she didn't.
- Yeah, but it was the makeup
for me.
It was just awful.
- That was probably
the best part, Camille.
[laughter]
- All right, let's head on
to the 49th state,
Alaska.
- I wasn't really expecting much
from Alaska
based on her performance
in the photo shoot.
But a little Saran Wrap
went a long way tonight.
The only thing is, it should've
had a little slit
'cause she had some difficulty
walking in it.
- My one thing was,
I would've loved to have seen
sparkly earrings up on that.
- Well, Michelle,
Alaska's not from New Jersey.
- [laughs]
- All right, let's move on
to Lineysha Sparx.
- What a gorgeous face
on this one.
- Yes.
- The gown was absolutely
gorgeous.
And when we found out that
it was wallpaper,
I was even more impressed.
- And to put a shoe, a pump,
in her hair,
I thought that was really fun
and whimsical.
- You're right.
And it could've very easily been
a disaster.
- But all in all, she's what
we call a TP.
- A total package,
that's right.
Let's talk ChaCha,
as in Serena ChaCha.
- Oh, God.
She literally
was drag Pinocchio.
It was lederhosen.
It was really like I was waiting
for yodeling.
It was all just a mess.
- She was showing so much of
this kind of, like,
oiled up chest.
- And it was like a little boy
with a costume on.
- I think that
she has to start thinking
about her tiny, little body
and the way she's gonna
execute her fashions.
- Well, she executed this
fashion.
[laughter]
- She sure did.
- Silence!
I've made my decision.
Bring back my girls.
[laughing]
Welcome back, ladies.
I've made some decisions.
Ivy Winters, your red gown
looked like it was ripped from
the pages of<i> Vogue.</i>
You're safe.
Alaska,
you had this challenge
in the bag.
You're safe.
- Thank you.
- Roxxxy Andrews,
you dove deep
into the dumpsters
of Beverly Hills
and made rubbish
look ravishing.
Condragulations.
You're the winner
of this challenge.
[applause]
You receive a custom gown
by Marco Marco,
plus immunity from elimination
next week.
-<i> Are you kidding me right now?</i>
<i>I'm on cloud nine.</i>
Suck that--aah!
Thank you
for believing in me.
- You may join the other girls.
Lineysha Sparx,
you lit up the runway
in classic Hollywood glamour.
You're safe.
-<i> I thought that</i>
I was gonna win.
<i>But whatever.</i>
- Serena ChaCha,
on the runway
you moved like Jagger,
but your red carpet look
was "coutorture."
I'm sorry, my dear, but you are
up for elimination.
-<i> Oh, crap.</i>
You really messed up.
<i>I do not wanna be the first</i>
<i>person sent home.</i>
This cannot fucking happen
at this point.
- Penny Tration, we love your
dangerous curves.
But your red carpet couture
veered off in the wrong
direction.
Jade Jolie, you didn't wear
your dress.
It wore you.
But still, your personality
shined through.
Jade Jolie...
you're safe.
- [exhales]
Thank you guys so much.
- Wait.
Hold up, mama.
May I give you a word of advice?
- Yes.
- Edit.
- Edit?
- That's right.
- Thank you so much.
- Penny Tration, I'm sorry,
my dear, but you are up
for elimination.
- [deep breath]
<i>I'm disappointed</i>
<i>because there are</i>
a lot of people who really
wanted me to be here.
<i>And I'm letting them down.</i>
- Two queens stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me
and save yourself
from elimination.
The time has come for you to
lip sync for your life.
-<i> This is my last chance</i>
<i>for the world to see</i>
why I deserve to be here.
<i>You better work.</i>
Like, you better work.
That's it.
- Good luck.
And don't fuck it up.
-<i> I absolutely have never</i>
<i>performed</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
Party in the USA.
<i>And I'm really just focusing on</i>
<i>doing the best job I can</i>
<i>with what I've got.</i>
-<i> The stakes are really high</i>
<i>right now.</i>
<i>Like this is</i>
<i>the real, real race.</i>
<i>And all I can think of</i>
<i>is deliver.</i>
-<i> Serena is turning the party,</i>
<i>girl.</i>
<i>And then, ooh!</i>
She drops into a split.
<i>Now, I know this is</i>
<i>every girl's old faithful,</i>
<i>but she did it the right way.</i>
-<i> I'm looking at Penny</i>
<i>and I'm wondering,</i>
"Why does she keep
turning around?"
-<i> She didn't know the words.</i>
<i>You know, that's an old-school</i>
<i>drag queen trick.</i>
When you don't know the words,
turn around,
do something
to distract them.
-<i> I'm thinking Penny Tration</i>
<i>is going to turn it out.</i>
I was wrong.
[chuckles]
[cheers and applause]
- Ladies, I've made
my decision.
Serena ChaCha...
Shantay, you stay.
You may join the other girls.
- [crying]
- Penny Tration, even though
this isn't
the Hollywood ending
you dreamed of,
never, ever stop
reaching for the stars.
- Don't worry about that.
- Now, sashay away.
- Thank you all.
[applause]
<i>Given the circumstances,</i>
<i>I don't have any regrets.</i>
I don't think there's much else
I would've done differently.
<i>And I'm not sure</i>
<i>that there's much else</i>
<i>I would be able to show them.</i>
And my family's
already proud of me,
regardless
of what happens here.
- My lucky, lucky 13,
condragulations.
Now remember,
if you can't love yourself,
how in the hell you gonna love
somebody else?
Can I get a "amen" up in here?
all: Amen!
- All right,
now let the music play.


- Previously on
<i>Rupaul's Drag Race...</i>
- Coco Montrese.
- Alyssa Edwards.
- We haven't spoken
in two years.
The pageant
tore our friendship apart.
- Alyssa and I will have
our moment later together,
'cause we need a moment.
- You'll be lip-synching
to the spoken word, darling.
- I think Lineysha
is going to struggle the most
because of the language barrier.
- This is not
<i>Rupaul's Best Friend Race.</i>
- No [bleep], Sherlock.
I'm not focused, because I have
so much going on in my head.
[choked up]
I'm not just a drag queen.
I'm a transgendered woman.
- One of you really
lip-smacked the competition.
Lineysha Sparx.
- [laughs]
- Monica Beverly Hillz...
Shante, you stay.
Serena Chacha...
sashay away.
[footsteps approach]
- [sighs]
- Chacha,<i> adios,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> darling.</i>
- We're back in the workroom,
and Serena went home.
Came a mess.
Left a mess.
- Ooh!
[laughter]
- As you can tell,
I am just very upset.
[laughs]
- "Keep hearing light."
What does that mean?
- "Bearing light."
- Oh.
- Oh, okay.
'Cause the only thing I was
hearing was "Sashay away."
[laughter]
- Well, on that note.
[sighs]
I'm happy I survived
the lip-synch.
And I let out a huge secret.
It really took a toll today,
and I just felt like,
you know what?
I can't hold
that secret no more.
- Yeah, seriously.
- Be proud.
- We all love you.
- We love you.
- So, speaking of secrets,
what the hell is going on
with you and Coco?
- Look, at the end of the day,
this, right here, I won.
- Mm.
- But who's in the picture?
- Miss Coco.
- I think you should ask Coco.
- I want to know the T
on what happened
between you and Alyssa...
- Oh, God.
- Because this has been
going on for so long.
- They crowned her
that night, you know?
And things happen, and...
obligations weren't fulfilled.
And it put us in a situation
where our friendship
was on the line.
- 'Cause you took her spot.
- Legally, I had to do that.
- Every story has two sides.
- With all the controversy
at Miss Gay America,
this is a personal vendetta
for myself.
I think it's time for me
to get this off my chest.
- The winner of
<i>Rupaul's Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
receives a sickening supply
of Colorevolution cosmetics,
a luxury trip
courtesy of alandchuck.travel,
headline Logo's Drag Race tour,
and a cash prize of $100,000.
And tonight,
extra special guest judges
Paulina Porizkova and Coco.
- Whoo!
- Whoo.
- Yay!
- [together]
Rolaskatox.
- It's a new day.
I'm walking into the workroom,
wondering what the hell
is about to happen.
No more groups.
- No.
- No more groups.
[siren blares]
- Ooh, girl!
You've got shemail.
Hey, my little ladyboys.
all: Hey.
- Growing up is so overrated,
and America's next
drag superstar
needs to really embrace
her inner child
if she's gonna become one fierce
mother-tucker.
This message was brought to you
by the letter T.
- Oh, my God.
- Yes.
- Oh.
- Hello, hello, hello.
[overlapping greetings]
Do you know what time it is?
all: No.
- It's time for the junior
drag superstar pageant!
- Oh!
[all exclaiming]
- Instantly, I'm thinking,
"A pageant?"
This is my gig, and I've been
quite successful at it.
- But, ladies, you won't be
the contestants.
You need to turn these boy toys
into cutie patooties.
[giggles]
[laughter]
Pick a partner.
- I looked to the left and said,
"Oh, hell no.
I'm not working with Alyssa."
- You've got 15 minutes.
The team with the most sickening
painted baby will win.
Ready, set, drag the children.
- Whoa!
- Oh!
- You know, we're all
considered kai kai now.
We have daughters
with another queen.
- Our girl's gonna win
grand supreme.
You just watch.
- Little flippers.
- [laughs]
- Don't mess it up,
or you won't get no go-go juice.
I immediately
turn into pageant mom.
Now, I never could make it
in the pageant scene
when I was a girl, so you're
so lucky you get to do this.
- Time's up.
Now, may I present the drag
superstars of tomorrow.
First up,
Roxxxy Andrews and Detox.
- Hi, I'm Rachel Zoe,
and this is our daughter,
Vaxeline Androxxx Zoe.
She just wants to go to Paris
every weekend and see the shows,
dressed in
all the finest couture.
And because I'm Rachel Zoe,
we allow that.
- [laughs]
- She's kind of a big deal.
[camera shutter snaps]
- I'd like to present
little Tina Lou Devereaux.
She wants to make makeup
and fashionable accessories
more accessible to young girls,
because it is never too young
to start upholding
the "Amurrican" ideal
of "femininitity".
[laughter]
- I couldn't have
said it better myself.
- Watermelon is decked out
in glitz,
glamour, and a flipper
she's able to grow into
for the years to come.
She's a world champion
watermelon seed spitter.
- [laughs]
- I present to you
our very own Savannah Lee.
She is a former Miss Mesquite,
Little Miss America.
Her platform in life
is world peace for all.
- Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
[applause]
- Now that's a modern family.
- I'd like everyone to meet
Lil' Pound Cake.
Her catchphrase is,
"You're not my real dad,
and you never will be."
- [laughing]
- Lil' Pound Cake
enjoys riding dirty
and being a straight-up
mother [bleep] [bleep] pig.
[laughter]
- [cackling]
- Monica and I have our
daughter, Patty Park Place.
She's won several pageants,
and unlike Savannah, she's
completed all of her reigns.
- Oh!
- Coco Montrese decides
to throw a little bit of shade
to be real cute.
I don't get cute.
I get drop-dead gorgeous.
[whispers] Shade.
- So, the miss junior
drag superstar is...
Lil' Pound Cake.
- Oh!
- All hail Lil' Pound Cake.
[camera shutter snaps]
Now, for this week's
main challenge,
you'll be creating lovable,
eccentric characters
for your own
kidster television shows.
[all exclaiming]
- Children's TV?
I'm like, "What the
mother [bleep] hell?"
- Your target audience
is the young
and the young at heart,
so your program
should be both entertaining
and "edumacational."
You'll be working in two groups.
Lineysha and Alaska, since
you won the mini-challenge,
you'll be team captains.
Lineysha, you pick first.
- Honey.
- Toxie.
- Coco Montrese.
- Hey, girl.
- Roxxx-an.
- Rolaskatox!
both: Rolaskatox!
[laughter]
- Jinkx.
- Vivienne.
- [nasal voice]
Ivy Winterrr.
[laughs]
[nasal voice]
Winterrrs.
- "Montica".
- Yay.
- All right, Lineysha.
Who do you choose next?
- [whispers indistinctly]
We were all in Lineysha's ear
saying, "Don't pick Alyssa."
- Jade.
- [whispers] Thank God.
- So Alyssa will go
to Alaska's team.
- Darling.
- I might have been picked last,
but honestly,
I ended up on the team
that I wanted to be on.
The queens of the competition.
- Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best woman win.
- I have a idea.
Why you can't make,
like, a muppet,
and take talking like,
"la la la la," and--
- Ohh.
- Ventriloquist?
- Ventriloquist, so--
- Yes, you,
and she's the little girl.
- Oh,
like a ventriloquist dummy.
- Girl, they 'bout to try
to send me home.
In the show in Vegas,
I'm the star.
So when you give me a role
like a ventriloquist doll...
- So what are some things
that we can talk about?
Um...
- Um...
- Now is the hard part.
We have to actually
come up with the material.
I'm trying to find out--figure
out how to make it funny.
- This is really, really hard.
- At some point,
I think Coco got frustrated
and kind of walked off.
- I want to wear my hair up.
I'll be glad when
the group challenges are over.
- I'm kind of panicking.
How are we gonna pull this off?
- Coming up...
It never occurred to me that
you'd actually be out of drag.
- I'm in drag, Ru.
- But you're in a male drag.
- I heard that you went around
everywhere and badmouthed me.
- [bleep] you, Alyssa.
- [laughing]
- So our challenge
is to put together
a children's television show
which is full of sneaky little
dirty double-entendres.
Our word of the day is "box."
This is the challenge
that I've been waiting for.
Finally we get to act
and we get to write
and we get to create.
I'm gonna be a farmer.
And we can each be,
like, a barnyard animal.
- I'll be the chicken lady.
- And you should be, like,
Venus Xtravaganza.
You should be her.
"Oh, you wanna talk about..."
both: "Reading, dahling."
- You can just be Uncle Dick
the cross-dresser.
- Be, like,
real butch about it.
[rough voice]
Look at how pretty I am.
And not fishy.
- Really?
The cross-dressing uncle?
Girl, they're pulling the patch.
Can't be bothered.
Do you think
it would be more funny,
'cause she's fishier than me,
if she was the Uncle Dick?
- I like you
as a cross-dresser.
I'm a little worried about
Alyssa because she's very much
into, "Oh,
Alyssa has to look this way,
and Alyssa
has to look that way."
And I hope that doesn't
hold us back.
- Hello, hello, hello.
[all shouting greetings]
Did I catch you boys
playing dress-up?
- Uh-huh.
- Well, hello, team Alaska.
all: Hi, Ru.
- How's it going over here?
- It's going.
- Who's gonna be your host?
- Hi.
- Now, what character
are you doing?
- Buffalo Bill.
- Oh, okay.
- And, um, it's a barnyard,
and our show is called something
like<i> Barnyard Boogers.</i>
- [laughs]
So who's doing
the word of the day?
- That's me.
- What is the word of the day?
- Box.
- Box?
- B-o-x.
- Of course.
And it's just now coming to me
how you can make--
- A lot of things
come in my box.
- [laughs] Yes, a lot of things
could come in your box, exactly.
[laughter]
Now, what are you kids doing?
- She's teaching the social
lesson of the day.
- Don't be throwing no shade.
- And how do you get kids
to not throw shade?
Well, you know,
the thing about these shows,
especially, like,<i> </i>
<i>Pee-wee's Playhouse,</i>
is that a lot
of what you're doing here
has a subversive twist to it.
Do you have a message
that you're trying to convey
to the children?
- Down with communism.
[laughter]
- Okay.
You guys have
a lot of work to do,
and I'm gonna let you
get back to it, okay?
- Thank you, Ru.
- All right, I'll see you later.
- Thank you, Ru.
- Hey, team Lineysha.
all: Hi.
- So tell me about your
kidster show.
Who's gonna do your "how to"
segment?
- Lineysha and myself.
- Oh, really?
- We are making banana splits.
- In two languages.
- What are you gonna do to
really send it over the top?
- It's gonna be funny.
[laughs]
- All right.
Are you the host?
- Yes, Lineysha asked me
to be the host.
- And which--
what part of the challenge
have you been assigned?
- Actually, Coco and I
are both doing
the social lesson
for the day.
- Which is what?
- It's "Always tell the T."
- Of course.
- T.T. and Tiny.
T.T.'s always teaching Tiny
to tell the T.
- Right.
Are you gonna be able
to bring the funny, though?
- I think we're gonna
focus more on quality
and not quantity.
- All right.
Well, you kids have a lot
to work with.
You've got a lot to do.
So I'm gonna let you
get back to it, okay?
- All right. Thanks, Ru.
- All right, turn it out.
- Thank you, Ru.
- We'll just have to show Ru
that we all can be funny.
- Look, do you like that look?
- You look like Willam.
- [laughs]
- Hello, ladies.
- Hi, Rupaul.
We're right about to shoot
our TV show for kids,
and I'm feeling very excited,
because I really feel like
we're gonna nail it.
- It's funny, 'cause when
we talked in the workroom,
and you said Buffalo Bill,
it never occurred to me
that you'd actually
be out of drag.
- I'm in drag, Ru.
- But you're in a male drag.
That's an interesting choice.
- Here we go.
We're going to get read
before we even start?
Two thumbs down.
- All right, Michelle and I
are here to direct you.
So show us what you got.
Action.
- Look, everybody.
It's clucky the cock!
- [clucking]
It's our secret word of the day.
You want to hear what it is?
It's "box"!
- Whoa!
- [laughs]
- Cut.
Clucky, you're delivering
your lines to Buffalo Bill.
You've got to play
more to the camera.
Action.
- So many things
fit inside my box.
- [laughing]
- This is a petite box.
I don't think it's Michelle's.
- [guffaws]
- [squawking]
Boxes!
- [lisping]
I am so excited to be here!
I'm ready to toss
your salad, Anita.
First thing you want to do
is clean your lettuce.
- I like a cheesy salad.
- Cut. Vivienne...
- Yeah?
- If you can bring your energy
up to meet Roxxxy's--
- Okay.
- It feels like you're in
two different sketches.
- You get lost.
- [flat] Say, let's go get our
other friends to toss our salad.
- Moving on.
- It's real sunny up here,
but I do like
a little bit of shade.
- Can't you see
I'm trying to get some sun?
Sunlight on the skin...
Boom. I blank.
- Cut.
- Can't you see I'm trying
to get some sun on this skin?
Sunlight is, uh--
- Cut.
- Can't you see I'm trying
to get some sun?
Sunlight on the skin--
[bleep].
I'm, like, totally [bleep]
my [bleep] bathing suit.
And that's not cute.
- Monica, do you want to look
at the lines again?
- Yeah, they're right here.
- Oh, they are.
- And you're not reading it?
- All right, ladies.
Fantastic.
- When you're team captain,
if the whole thing
goes like a train wreck,
then it's you
who has to pay for it.
Ugh.
- Coming up...
- A nice, plump banana.
-<i> En Espanol, guineo.</i>
- Lineysha just literally
translated it.
- And this is my little friend.
Coco doesn't know
what her lines are.
- Is that it?
[laughing]
- We're walking on set to shoot
our children's television show.
- And they are all in drag.
- Funny how that works
on<i> Rupaul's Drag Race.</i>
- Uh-huh.
- Comedy's kind of my thing,
so I'm really excited
to really shine.
- All right,
let's see your big opening.
- Are you guys excited
for today's episode?
The word of the day is...
"blow."
- Jinkx revealed my word, blow.
It kind of threw me off.
I had a speech ready,
and everything rhymed,
so I just had to scramble
and just kind of
come up with something quick.
If you think of blow,
I think of bubbles.
- Oh, look at all those bubbles
you're blowing!
- Blow.
[giggles]
- Cut.
Jade, it took you a little bit
longer to land the lines.
Get to the point
a little faster.
- Little aggravated.
- Action.
- Now, my favorite treat
is the banana split.
And the ingredients are a nice,
plump banana.
-<i> En Espanol, guineo.</i>
- Lineysha is not really
bringing the Latin flavor
that I thought
she was going to bring.
- Go ahead and cut that in half.
-<i> En Espanol,</i>
<i>cortalo por la mitad.</i>
- She just literally
translated it.
- Cherries.
- All right, moving on.
- Hello, everyone.
I'm T.T., and this
is my little friend...
we haven't even practiced.
Coco doesn't know
what her lines are.
- Jessica.
- All right, cut.
- Your timing is too slow.
You need to pick it up.
Coco, you need to be on it.
- Ready, and action.
- What's the T?
Why do they really
call you Tiny?
- 'Cause I'm small.
Yeah.
I'm a ventriloquist doll.
I don't know if I'm supposed
to look at the camera,
look away from the camera.
- Coco, think more Pinocchio
and less the puppet from<i> Saw.</i>
- Do you have something
that you'd like to say?
- Is that it?
- That's it.
- All right.
Do you have any notes?
- Nope.
- Okay, that's a wrap.
all: Rolaskatox.
- It's elimination day, and
today's theme for the runway
is "think pink".
Jinkx.
- Mm-hmm?
- Are you gonna
add that hair into that hair?
- Yeah.
My grandma got me this wig
when I was, like, 17.
- So your grandma
was buying you wigs, girl?
- My mom wasn't really into it.
- Uh-huh.
- But my grandma and I
would be getting me in drag,
and then I'd go out to the club.
She'd let me be
who I wanted to be, you know?
My grandma made it possible
for me to do drag
at a very early age.
And that's when I really started
coming alive.
She helped set up my life
to put me where I am today.
So it has a lot of sentimental
value to me.
- I feel so mentally drained
right now.
I'm trying to finish my costume,
and this whole Alyssa thing,
it's still bothering me.
We competed at Miss Gay America
together.
- Huh?
- They crowned her.
I ended up having
to take over the title.
We haven't talked in two years.
- Coco, if you want to come talk
to me, you can talk to me,
but you don't have to read me
over there, though.
- I'm not reading you.
I'm not saying
anything about you.
I've got to get this
off my back.
This needs to be done.
Can I talk to you, like,
five minutes, just me and you?
- Oh, [bleep], this is gonna get
[bleep] interesting.
Let me get some popcorn.
- It was pure hell.
- Okay.
- How would you feel
if you're standing onstage
with a crown on your head,
singing your song,
and someone yells out,
"You ain't the real
Miss America anyway!"
I just smile and wave.
In the inside, I am torn.
I almost lost my relationship
because of that whole thing.
That whole thing
turned my world upside-down.
- Well, I lost
my whole reputation
I'd worked ten years for.
[chuckles]
He didn't win Miss Gay America.
I did.
So he wasn't the one embarrassed
in front of the whole community.
I was. I'm the very first
to get dethroned.
Nobody gets dethroned.
I'm not a drug addict.
I'm not an alcoholic.
I'm a teacher.
I'm a mentor. I'm a leader.
But, Coco, I heard
that you went around everywhere
and badmouthed me, saying
I couldn't fulfill my reign.
You got on your face--hold on.
Let me finish.
But, see, you're doing all that,
and you're not even
being fair to me.
- I am being fair to you.
I'm listening to you.
- Girl, you are saying, "I'm on
the beach drinking a margarita.
I'm the one with the crown.
I'm the one."
- I don't--I--
- Why did you write
on your Facebook,
"Alyssa shouldn't have won
in the first place"?
Do you feel like
that was a hit below the belt?
- [crying] I laid in bed next
to my husband, and, like, God--
he's like,
"What is wrong with you?"
And I can't--I couldn't take it.
And--
- And then the tears come out.
Coco is doing what he does best.
He's making it seem like
he's the victim.
He's always the victim.
And the Academy Award goes to...
- [bleep] you, Alyssa.
- I gave him the benefit of
the doubt and got nothing back.
- This whole thing
was not resolved.
I'm done with that situation.
I got to get ready
for the runway.
- [laughing]
Welcome to the main stage of
<i>Rupaul's Drag Race.</i>
Michelle Visage,
won't you be my neighbor?
- Always, my little lemon drop.
- [laughs]
Santino Rice.
- I am ready to school
these children.
- I look at her here,
and I see seductive.
I look at her hair,
and I see wicked beauty.
Paulina Porizkova.
- I am so glad to be here.
I've been trying to get on your
damn show for five years now.
[laughter]
- Mrs. T's in the house.
Coco.
Rupaul loves Coco too.
- I love Rupaul.
- [laughs]
This week,
our queens were challenged
to create breakout characters
in their own
kidster television shows.
And tonight, they're dressed
to tickle you pink.
- Whoo.
- Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best woman win.
Coming up...
- You committed the number one
crime in showbiz--
you bored me.
- [laughing]
First up, the 49th state,
Alaska.
So pink mafia.
- I look like a ghost
from the Civil War.
A McQueen fashion show.
- She bleeds pink.
- She's a sex pistol.
- Monica Beverly Hillz.
Someone caught the bouquet.
- I'm feeling extra fishy.
My nails are right.
My hair's tight.
I'm just giving it.
- This is very
Singapore Airlines.
- Come fly with me.
- Alyssa Edwards.
- I want that outfit.
- I am channeling
my Little Miss Perfect gig.
It's the deal. It's the ish.
- Madonna reborn again.
- Yes.
- Vivienne Pinay.
- Hold me closer, tiny dancer.
[laughter]
- I'm feeling cute,
prissy, and girly.
And the judges
are really eating it up.
- Ooh.
- I think I just saw
her pink slip.
[laughter]
Next up, Detox.
- This is
<i>Playboy: The Victorian Years.</i>
- My tits are bouncing
everywhere.
I mean, I have a great body,
so why not show it off?
- Okay, no kidding,
I have this outfit.
- [laughs]
- She is a hot mesh.
Roxxxy Andrews.
- Bam.
- Pink Panther on the runway.
- The dress is flowing.
I look drop-dead gorgeous.
- It's a mullet dress!
- [laughs]
- Uh-huh.
- Business in the front,
party in the back.
- Lineysha Sparx.
Sell the garment, honey.
- I feel so fierce, flawless,
like a top model.
- Looks like Cinderella's
got a hot date.
Jinkx Monsoon.
- Ooh, la, la.
- Oh,<i> Dangerous Liaisons.</i>
- I am flouncing
down the runway
with my snuff box,
let them eat all this cake,
bitches.
- Marie Aqua Net.
[laughter]
- Coco Montrese.
- Shirley Temple Black?
- Why it got to be black?
- I am giving you
your baby doll fish.
I look so cute.
- I didn't know
she was into bears.
[laughter]
[nasal voice]
Ivy Winterrrs.
- Where is Crystal Conner
when you need her?
- Yes.
- I'm strutting
like a Vegas showgirl.
I feel like
a beautiful flamingo.
- You can just stick her
in somebody's front lawn.
[laughter]
- Honey Mahogany.
- She just jumped out of bed
and grabbed the duvet cover.
- Very Bed Bath and Beyonce.
- [laughs]
- I am feeling really strong,
pummeling the runway.
- That face is Iman...
- Yes.
- But that walk
is pure pissed off.
[laughter]
- Jade Jolie.
- Work it.
- Very<i> Girls Next Door</i>
Holly Madison.
- I'm feeling so pretty in pink.
I'm serving the judges
pure fish, hunty.
- [laughs]
- Barbie girl in a Barbie world.
- Life in plastic,
it's fantastic.
- Welcome, ladies.
Let's take a look
at your kidster TV shows.
First up,<i> Barnyard Buddies.</i>
[cow moos, cow bell clanks]
- Hi, everybody!
I'm Buffalo Bill.
Let's meet
some of my amazing friends.
- [clucks]
- Look, everybody!
It's clucky the cock!
- [clucking]
Hi, kids!
- Now, I heard
you're sitting on a secret.
- It's our
secret word of the day.
Shh.
It's "box"!
- Whoa!
[laughter]
- Can I borrow your horse?
- Yeah, sure, clucky.
- Let's try to cram it
in the box!
- Cram it in! Yeah!
- Your horse won't fit
in the box!
[kids giggling]
Your horse is just too big
for my pink box!
[kids laughing]
- Look, everybody.
It's Anita Bum!
- Today we're gonna learn
how to toss salad
with my good friend,
Tasha Salad.
- [lisping] I'm so excited
to be here today.
Well, let's get started.
First thing you want to do
is clean your lettuce.
- Now, is it harmful
to toss a dirty salad?
- Some people are into that.
- Instead of using
the uncut carrots,
can we use the cut carrots?
- Yes. What you want to do is
peel the skin back.
Cut carrots always seem
to be cleaner. Okay?
We're tossing salads one person
at a time across America.
[kids cheer]
- What's up, Fanny?
- Today I'm going to be...
teaching a social lesson.
Don't be throwing no shade.
- Look, it's everyone's
favorite cross-dresser,
Uncle Dick!
- It's real sunny up here.
But I do like
a little bit of shade.
- Don't be throwing
no shade, sir.
Can't you see
I'm trying to get some sun?
Sunlight on your skin
creates vitamin D
and elevates the mood, so...
all: Don't be shady.
Be a lady.
- Bye-bye, everybody!
- [clucks]
- Bye!
[laughter and applause]
- Next up,<i> The Magic Bush.</i>
- My name is Princess Pinklips.
Are you guys excited
for today's episode?
Then let's all bounce.
And now shake your hands
like this.
Ooh, isn't this fun?
Oh!
Today we have a special word of
the day.
The word of the day is...
"blow."
- I always think of bubbles.
Now with bubbles,
you really work it.
Just give it your all.
Kind of like an explosion
of bubbles.
- You're so good at blowing,
Jolly Jade.
- Well, I don't have blue lips
for no reason.
[laughter]
- Next we're going to welcome
Cherry Chocolatina
and Lola the Exploda.
- Now, my favorite treat
is the banana split.
Now, go ahead
and peel the banana.
-<i> Suavemente, vas a pelar</i>
<i>para atras el guineo.</i>
- Oh.
- Ooh.
- Ooh, Miss Lola's
favorite part is the cream.
- [panting]
Help me, girl.
[both panting and murmuring]
- Ooh! Oh!
- Oh!
- Wow.
- It exploded!
- Hello, everyone.
I'm T.T.,
and this is my little friend.
- Tiny.
- That reminds me.
It's time for
our social lesson of the day.
Always tell the T.
- Is my T my truth?
- Yes, your T is your truth.
Do you have something
that you'd like to say?
- Uh-uh.
[awkward silence]
[solo clapping]
- All right.
- I think there were
some weak links,
but I think there were some weak
links in the other team too.
At least this team's
all in drag.
- Coming up...
- You're gonna get lost,
'cause there's some
hungry bitches up here.
- This is<i> Rupaul's Drag Race.</i>
- Not<i> Rupaul's Best Friend</i>
<i>Out Of Drag Race.</i>
[laughing]
Ladies, this week
you worked as teams,
but tonight, you'll be judged
as individuals.
When I call your name,
please step forward.
Honey Mahogany.
Ivy Winters.
Jade Jolie.
Alyssa Edwards.
Lineysha Sparx.
Lineysha, you're lucky
you have immunity.
Otherwise,
you'd be in the bottom.
The girls I've called forward,
you are all safe.
You may leave the stage.
Ladies, you represent
the very best
and the very worst of the week.
It's time for
the judges' critiques.
First up, Alaska.
- Hi.
- I love your dust bunny hair,
and I love your
pink splattered blood.
You are such an original.
- Tonight on the runway,
I love it.
I'm just concerned for you
with the boy-drag.
It is a drag show.
You know, I'm paying my $5.
I want to see Alaska.
- Next up,
Monica Beverly Hillz.
- I don't know if
during the<i> Barnyard Bunch</i>
you just got nervous,
but you need to project more,
or you're gonna get lost,
'cause there's some
hungry bitches up here.
- It's inside of you.
I could see that--
that Beverly Hills bitch--
when you walked out.
But then you kind of went
in your shell after a while.
- Thank you, Monica.
Vivienne Pinay.
- Tonight you look really cute.
It's unfortunate that
you created that character
and then that it
kind of fell so flat.
- You committed the number one
crime in showbiz--
you bored me.
- Moving on to...
- Your costume wasn't
my favorite part of you.
It was really just,
like, your jokes
and your mannerisms
and your volume.
- You rock the stage.
You rock it in acting.
I really like the shake
in the boobies.
Yeah, thank you.
- I know I had a lot of
competition up here tonight...
- Yes, right?
- Up next, Roxxxy Andrews.
- You float above the concrete.
- Thank you.
- I love it.
- Tasha salad was freaking
hilar.
- Jinkx Monsoon.
- Jinkx, you're the North Star
in your little group,
because they would've been lost
without you.
Looking like Glenn Close
in<i> Fatal Attraction</i>
for a kids' show?
I mean, that in itself
is completely demented.
- Coco Montrese.
- This was not your challenge.
I can't really tell you why.
- They wanted me
to be a marionette,
and I was just supposed
to answer the question.
And that's not me.
In the show in Vegas, I am the--
I'm the front. I'm the star.
- If you are good
at being in the spotlight,
you should know how to steal it.
- There's been a lot on my mind.
- What's on your mind?
- [tearful]
Alyssa's my friend.
We didn't talk for two years.
And...
Coming here and seeing her here
completely threw me off.
And I don't feel like
I'm showing you who--
who I really am,
'cause I'm better than that.
- I know there's distractions,
but, Coco, keep your head
in the game
and be Coco.
All right, ladies.
I think we've heard enough.
While you untuck in
the Interior Illusions Lounge,
the judges and I
will deliberate.
Okay, just between us "goyls,"
what do you think?
Starting with Roxxxy Andrews.
- She's absolutely a stunner.
The hair color.
J.Lo wishes.
- Yes.
What did you think of her
performance as Tasha Salad?
- There is nothing
more attractive
than seeing a beautiful woman
dare to be ugly.
- Uh-huh.
- I expect some good stuff
out of that one.
- Next up, Alaska.
Now, Michelle, you and I
both looked at each other
when Alaska came out
dressed as a man...
- Mm-hmm.
- And thought, "What the F?"
- It really was
just Pee-wee Herman.
- Yeah, that's true.
- And this is
<i>Rupaul's Drag Race.</i>
- Not<i> Rupaul's Best Friend</i>
<i>Out Of Drag Race.</i>
- Okay.
- Alaska, to me,
he doesn't stand out.
He's, like, someone I would
hang out with in high school.
- What high school
did you go to?
- Well, I mean, I was
a homeschooler, but, um...
[laughter]
- Monica Beverly Hillz.
- Who was she again?
- She played Fanny
the farm hand--sunglasses.
- Oh, well, see,
that's how memorable she was.
- Well, there you go.
- She was such a nervous wreck.
You can never let them
see you sweat.
- She's stopping herself.
- Exactly, the calls are coming
from inside the house.
Vivienne Pinay.
- Anita Bum was forgettable.
- Right,
'cause if she was Anita Bum,
she could've been really hyper,
like, you know, um, yeah, um--
She could've gone for it,
you know?
- When I see a Plain Jane,
kind of like her--
'cause she is boring--
I like to do them up.
- Turn her out.
- Turn her out!
That's what I love to do.
- Detox.
- Kids would love watching
Clucky the cock.
- I see Faye Dunaway had a child
with Anjelica Huston,
and then she lost
all her fashion sense
and started wearing clothes
with holes in them.
- Yes.
- Sorry, Coco.
[laughter]
- Jinkxy Monsoon.
- She got me in the mood.
Like, I was singing with her.
I was raising my hands.
- Oh, right.
- I was a little girl.
- She was the only reason
that team stayed afloat.
- Coco Montrese.
- She had an issue with,
you know,
not getting the right part,
but you have to take lemons
and make lemonade.
- Blaming your shortcomings
on somebody else?
- Mm-hmm.
- Please.
- And you know, Santino,
playing the dummy can be
a real scene-stealing role,
right, Michelle?
[laughter]
I mean--
- [guffawing]
- You know I love you, and I
only say it 'cause it's true.
- Yeah.
- I was just telling everybody
how much nicer
you were than Tyra.
[laughter]
- Silence.
I've made my decision.
Bring back...
[whispers] My girls.
[laughing]
Welcome back, ladies.
I've made some decisions.
Roxxxy Andrews,
your portrayal
of Tasha Salad was,
in a word,
[lisping] sensational.
You are safe.
Jinkx Monsoon.
You're safe.
- Thank you.
- Monica Beverly Hillz.
Your kidster character
was not after-school special.
I'm sorry, my dear, but you are
up for elimination.
Detox, your Clucky the cock...
bl-bl-bl-blocked...
The competition.
Condragulations, you are the
winner of this week's challenge.
[applause]
You've won a wig wardrobe
from new attitude wigs.
- I won the challenge!
- Alaska, your choice
to perform as a boy...
[sighs]
was a real drag.
You are...
safe.
Coco, your ventriloquist act
could have been hilarious,
but your performance was wooden.
Vivienne Pinay.
America's next drag superstar
has to be more than just pretty.
Much more.
Vivienne...
you...
are safe.
But consider this a warning.
Coco Montrese,
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
- I cannot believe
I'm up for elimination.
Is this really happening?
I'm not ready to go home.
- Two queens stand before me.
Ladies, this is your
last chance to impress me
and save yourself
from elimination.
The time has come...
for you to lip-sync...
for your life.
- Bitch, win or lose, let's go.
- Good luck...
and don't [bleep] it up.
- Mama ain't going that easy.
I gotta pull it out and let Ru
know why I should be here.
So here goes.
- We're all kind of like,
"Oh, my gosh."
Coco's serving it up.
- Monica doesn't seem
to have much energy.
She just didn't seem
to have that will
to lip-sync for her life.
[applause]
- [mouths words]
- Ladies,
I've made my decision.
Coco Montrese...
Shante, you stay.
You may join the other girls.
- Thank you.
- Monica,
you came here with a secret.
And the secret is
you are fierce and talented.
Go share that with the world.
- [crying] Thank you
for believing in me.
Thank you for seeing something
in me that I never saw.
[sniffles]
- Thank you.
- I love you.
Thank you so much.
- We love you.
Now sashay away.
- I had a hard time
opening up to the girls.
I've always had that problem.
It did hold me back
in this competition.
But I am fierce.
And I need to just step back
and be okay with that.
- 11 queens, 1 crown.
Now, remember,
if you can't love yourself,
how in the hell you gonna
love somebody else?
Can I get an amen up in here?
all: Amen!
- All right,
now let the music play!


- Previously on
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race...</i>
To make it in RuPaulywood,
you've gotta dive in
the deep end.
- Agh!
I can't do it.
I fail.
- Welcome to the slums of
Beverly Hills.
- Aah! Mommy!
- Ow! That's my leg.
You know, I have a feeling
you just like to be
the only pretty one.
- You're just--
like, so immature.
It's just really aggravating.
- Little bitty Serena,
she's fucking irritating
the shit out of me.
Penny Tration.
Alaska.
Roxxxy Andrews.
You made rubbish look ravishing.
Condragulations.
- Oh!
- You're the winner
of this challenge.
Serena Chacha,
Shantay, you stay.
Penny Tration,
sashay away.
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, look what Penny wrote.
- Aww.
- We love you, Penny Tration.
We're back in the workroom
after Penny was just eliminated,
and it's really hard 'cause
I'm really gonna miss her.
- All right, Penny,
here we go.
Bye-bye.
- All: Bye, Penny.
- I happen to have stumbled.
And that's okay.
I know that destiny
wanted the queens to see
how good of a performer I am.
Maybe that's what I needed for
the queens to really respect me.
- Well, I already thought
I was gonna be on the bottom.
It scared the shit out of me,
and I realized looking
at you guys competing,
I was like, "You know what?
That could've been me."
I just feel like
I'm different
from the rest of these girls,
you know.
My head, mentally, it's, like,
somewhere else.
- There was something
about Monica
at Penny's elimination.
She just wasn't happy
that we were safe.
- I thought Penny was revving up
for it at the beginning.
I was like, "Watch out, girl."
- Aw, does that mean you guys
were rooting for me?
Were any of you guys
wishing I went home?
- I love Penny.
And Penny and I have gotten c--
you know what I'm saying?
And I'm not trying to be a bitch
or anything,
but you've kind of gotten on
my nerves a little bit so far.
I'm upset because I really would
rather see Serena go home.
- Serena has annoyed me
to the point where
I can't say anything nice
about her.
I'm just gonna try my best
to avoid Serena,
and if she's gonna
get in my way,
I'm just gonna smack her
like a fly over a cow patty.
Just go home, bitch.

[contestants ohh]
Hello, hello, hello.
[cheers and applause]
- Hi!
- Condragulations,
Serena Chacha.
You survived the first
lip-synch for your life.
- Yes!
- Let that be a lesson
to all of you.
To win $100,000,
you're going to need to put your
money where your mouth is.
Oh, pit crew!
[big band music]
- Ooh!
[laughter]
- What?
- Now, for today's
mini-challenge,
you need to pucker up
and impress me with the power
of your pie hole.
- Whoa.
- Using just your mouths,
I want to see winning
lip-synch performances
of my songs<i> Tranny Chaser,</i>
<i>Ladyboy,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
and<i> Peanut Butter,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
all available on iTunes.
[laughter]
You'll be competing
in three groups,
and the best lip sync
from each round will win.
So put on some lipstick,
and then go for the glory.
[laughter and cheers]
[energetic techno music]
- There are some crazy lips
in this room.
Detox looks like the Joker.
Lineysha looks like
a painted peacock fantasy.
And Coco's looking like she just
fell into a vat of glitter.
- Ladies, assume the position.
[dramatic drum roll]
You do that all so well.
[laughter]
[RuPaul's<i> Tranny Chasers]</i>
[laughter and applause]
That was awesome.
But one of you...
really, really...
popped.
[laughter and applause]
Serena Chacha.
- I won a mini-challenge.
Boom.
Take that, bitches.
[gong crashes]
[RuPaul's<i> Ladyboy]</i>

Hungry, hungry holes.
Ooh.
Ivy Winters.
[cheers and applause]
Nice lip jobs, ladies.
But consider that
just a warm-up.
For this week's main challenge,
it's gonna be a lip-synch
extravaganza.
[queens cheer]
You'll be taking classic moments
from the herstory of<i> Drag Race</i>
and recreating them
in your own scene-stealing
viral videos.
You'll be lip-synching
to the spoken word, darling.
I'm Laura Linney, and this is
<i>Masterpiece Theatre.</i>
[laughter]
Serena Chacha, Detox,
and Ivy Winters,
you're team captains.
Serena, you choose first.
- Ms. Roxxxy Andrews.
- I want my Lasky.
- [laughs]
- Toxy!
- Lasky!
- Ms. Lineysha.
[laughter]
- Ms. Alyssa, come here, baby.
- Give me Monica.
- Ms. Vivienne.
- Ms. Jinkx,
come here, baby.
- Coco Montrese,
get your ass over here,
bitch.
- Ivy Winters,
take your pick.
I'm sorry, Jade, but I'm gonna
have to go with Honey.
- That's okay, girl.
- And that means Jade Jolie
goes with Serena Chacha.
- I'm not exactly, like,
the person
that would normally
be picked last.
That kind of pissed me off.
- Yay!
Welcome to our... team...
- Ladies, I need your lip syncs
to be as tight
and unforgettable
as your charisma,
uniqueness, nerve,
and talent.
Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best woman win.
- Our team gets an envelope,
and we are gonna be lip-synching
to a video of past seasons
of<i> Untucked.</i>
And we are doing season three's
Raja and Delta
and then the scene with
Shangela, Mimi, and Mariah.
Shangela.
- Shangela.
- Mariah.
Somebody has to be Mimi.
- I think you should be Mimi.
- I think I should be Raja.
- I think you're Raja,
hands down.
- Yeah, I'll do Mimi.
- Okay, guys, so let's just
finalize this.
We have Raja, we have Delta,
we have Shangela--
- I'm Delta?
I was pretty much ignored.
I kind of got dealt with
what was left.
If our team is in the bottom,
I am gonna throw Serena right
into the freaking pit.
-<i> Coming up...</i>
Jade, did you choose
to be Delta?
- Do it again.
- Can I have a second?
- Oh, but you want to
really fight.
- [screams]
- [laughs]
- [laughs]
- So Ru tells us that
we will be reenacting scenes
from<i> Untucked</i><span style="bodyStyle"> from seasons</i>
two, three, and four.
- Aah!
- Season four.
- Season four.
- So we have
Ms. Lashauwn Beyond,
Jiggly Caliente,
Phi Phi O'Hara,
and my boyfriend,
Sharon Needles.
- We're Sharon and Phi Phi!
I call Phi Phi.
- No!
- I call Phi Phi.
- Okay, I'll be Sharon.
- I'll be the--Jiggly.
- You wanna do Jiggly?
And you'll be Lashauwn?
- Here we go.
- Phi Phi, I was not trying
to throw you under the bus.
- Girl, what you do best
is you act.
- Can you please
put a wonky eyelash on?
That's all I ask.
- Yes.
- This is gonna be sick, girl.
Anybody have any orange paint?
I know Phi Phi personally,
and I think she's
a lovely person,
but I'm taking this exaggeration
to the nth degree.
- [laughing]
Whoo!
- My foundation
is sickeningly dark,
and one of my lashes is gluing
one of my eyes shut.
That might be a little too dark.
- Um, Lineysha,
why don't you play Tyra?
- Tyra Sanchez.
I am doing season two.
We've got Morgan McMichaels,
Mystique, Tyra,
and Tatianna.
- There isn't anything else
to say.
- But why are you talking?
- Why are<i> you</i><span style="bodyStyle"> talking?</i>
- Because if I have a problem
with someone
or I have something to say to
someone, I say it to them.
If I don't like you,
I don't like you.
- Quite honestly,
I think Lineysha
is going to struggle
the most because of
the language barrier.
- Hello, hello, hello.
- Hello, Ru.
- Hi.
- Team Serena Chacha.
- Hola, hola, hola.
- Serena, you're playing...
- Raja.
- Raja.
- Yes.
- Did you assign the roles
for each person?
- We did it evenly.
- Jade, who are you playing?
- I'm Delta.
- Did you choose to be Delta?
- No, I was kind of, um,
a team player and just
gonna work it out.
- Okay.
So Jinkx is Mimi Imfurst.
What about you, Roxxxy?
Who are you playing?
- I'm doing Mariah.
- Mariah, of course.
- Mm-hmm.
- And you're playing?
- Shangela Halleloo.
I put her in drag
for her very first time.
- You did?
- Yes.
- A family that drags
together...
- All: Stays together.
- As you well know,
one of the best queens who's
ever used spoken word
in lip sync is Lypsinka.
- Yep.
- She is famous
for using dialogue
from Joan Crawford
and Bette Davis films.
Absolutely the best.
So now, are you kids gonna
give me just a taste?
- Are you, like,
curious at all
as to why Stacy didn't, like,
immediately pick you?
- I smell fear in her,
and I tend to kind of--
not pick on her, but I'm just
very, like, hard on her.
- So you're reading
off the thing.
You haven't memorized it yet.
And you haven't done any
characterization yet of Raja.
[dramatic music]
- Um, well, she doesn't really
move very much.
- She would still
have character.
Bring it up.
- Bring it up. I can do it.
I can do it. I can do it.
- Y'all make it work, okay?
See you later. All right.
- Thank you.
- Just make up a character,
honey.
Make up a something.
- Team Detox.
- Hi, Ru.
- Now, I know you're doing
season four.
Who's playing Sharon?
Who's playing Phi Phi?
- Phi phi.
- Duh.
- You're Phi Phi?
[laughs]
And you're Sharon?
- Yeah.
- It's interesting.
You live with Sharon.
Why didn't you play Sharon?
- I do Sharon all the time.
- Yeah.
- [laughs]
Now, who are you two?
- Ms. Jiggly Caliente.
- Jiggly Caliente.
- I'm Lashauwn Beyond.
- Lashauwn Beyond.
- Yes.
- What is the key to doing this?
Have you ever done spoken word?
- Not that much.
- What's the biggest challenge
with this scene?
- Honest, just listening to
Phi Phi's voice over and over.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Well, I'm gonna let you kids
get back to it.
- All right, Ru.
- And make it special.
- Okay.
- Thank you, Ru.
- Ivy Winters.
- Hi, Ru.
- So you're doing season two.
- Yes.
- And who are you playing?
- I'm playing Morgan.
- And who are you playing?
- Tatianna.
- Tatianna, of course.
- Yes.
- And you are?
- Mystique Summers.
- Mystique Summers Madison.
I wanted to call her
Mystique Summers eve.
But she wasn't having it.
Okay, who are you?
- Tyra Sanchez.
- You're the other, other Tyra.
Can we hear a little bit
of Tyra and Tatianna?
- Sure.
- Tapped me on the shoulder.
- I tapped you on the elbow
first.
- If it bothered anyone,
if they would have just said,
"Could you keep it down?
It's bothering me,"
that had would've been fine.
- And I did that.
- If someone comes to you...
- [laughs]
- And saying you're obnoxious--
- I'm watching you lip-synch.
- Ah, okay.
- That's not how I started it,
though.
I tapped you on the shoulder.
First I-I said your name
across the room.
- Okay, well, you got a lot
of work to do.
Get at it.
- Thank you, Ru.
- All right, see ya.
- Mwah.
- All right, dolls.
Now, I warned you this is gonna
be a lip-synch extravaganza.
Read my lips.
[silent]
[laughter and applause]
- Queens: Bye.
- Bye, Ru.
[hip-hop music]
- Oh.
My train, girl, my train.
Our challenge this week
is to lip-synch
to a past scene from<i> Untucked.</i>
Where do you want me to be?
- Mimi over here, then.
- My team had to do scenes from
season three.
It's Shangela, Mimi Imfurst,
and Mariah.
- Boo, just 'cause you got
a sugar daddy
who pays for everything
for you--
- Bitch!
- Oh!
- Hey, hey.
- No, no, no, no.
- Okay, ready?
[beep]
- Boo, just 'cause you got
a sugar daddy
who pays for everything
for you--
- Bitch!
- Oh!
- Hey, hey!
- No, no, no, no. No.
- Oh, my gosh. Watch out.
Watch out, watch out, watch out,
watch out, watch out, watch out.
Anybody get hurt?
- Graceful.
Do it again. Come on.
Push play.
- Bitch!
- Oh!
- Hey, hey!
- No, no, no, no. No, no.
- [laughing]
- Do it again.
Do it again.
- Can I have just one second
to get this back on?
- Here.
- Just get it for her fast.
Ready?
Five, four--
- Oh, shit!
- Do it again.
Just roll it up.
- I will never look like that.
- True.
[dramatic music]
- Do it again.
- It is easier for you to say,
"Do it again," okay?
- Hold on.
- Can I have a second?
- Oh, but you want to
really fight.
- It got to the point where
I had to yell and scream
and snap at people
just to be heard in that group.
[choked up]
And this is too important to me
to let them get to me like this.
-<i> Coming up...</i>
- Sweetie, if I hit you...
- You already lost.
- That would take the lose away.
- Honey, you are already out.
- I'm really starting
to get annoyed.
- [laughs]
- [laughs]
- Our challenge today is
we have to lip-synch
from a past season.
The second scene is with myself
and Serena.
We're playing Delta and Raja.
- Like,
it's like a soccer player
from, like, Paraguay
or something,
mixed with, like, Afghanistan
and<i> Charro.</i>
- I wonder if people
talk about us this way.
- At the end,
when you hear,
"I wonder if they talk about us
this way,"
you turn to us like you just
heard the entire conversation
or whatever.
- Okay.
- Then I'll just pass out.
I come from
an arts school environment,
and I believe that drag
is performing gender
through various skills, like
makeup as a form of painting,
fashion as a form
of self-sculpture,
and showmanship
through performance.
- I wonder if people talk
about us this way.
[coughs]
- Serena playing Raja...
that was really bizarre.
- All right.
How'd you guys feel about that?
I feel good.
[clapping]
How did you guys feel?
- Oh, my God.
We're so gonna be on the bottom
because of you.
- All right, ladies.
- All right.
The first scene that
my team is performing
is a catfight between
Morgan McMichaels
and Mystique Summers
from season two.
- Go fix your hair.
- I don't need some--
- Fix your mug.
- I don't need to fix my mug,
bitch.
- Honey, you do need to fix
your mug.
- Sweetie. Sweetie.
- You do need to--
- I don't gotta hit your ass
to probably get voted off,
bitch.
- Hit me. Do it.
- Walk off. Step off, bitch.
- Do it.
- Lineysha's acting crazy.
- Okay, let's do it again.
- We should be working
as a team,
and she's goofing off
and playing around.
- Don't be, like, banging
'cause the argument's
mainly about
what Morgan and Mystique
are saying.
- Hit me.
- Sweetie, if I hit you...
- You already lost.
- That will take the lose away.
- Honey, you are out. Lost.
- That will take the lose away.
- You already lost.
- I think Lineysha wants
all the eyes on her,
and I'm really starting
to get annoyed.
- Ooh.
- I'm playing Tatianna
in a scene where
Tatianna and Tyra are bickering
back and forth.
- If I don't like you,
I don't like you.
- And I don't like you.
Are you happy?
I don't like you.
- I was not talking to you.
- I'm saying it to your face.
Then why are you looking
in my direction?
- Ugh.
- I don't like you.
- I was not talking to you.
- I'm saying it to your face.
Then why are you looking
in my direction?
- [laughs]
Lineysha was the worst person
to work with,
but her performance as Tyra
was awesome.
She was so on point.
Um, she's one
to be reckoned with.
- Okay.
My team has two scenes
to reenact from season four,
one of which is between Phi Phi
O'Hara and Sharon Needles.
- Do you really think I'm upset
that I didn't get a cruise?
- The only thing
you keep saying is,
"I promised Alaska one thing,
"and that was to bring her back
a trip.
[whiny voice]
Why didn't I get a cruise?"
- I will say that
I really wanted a cruise,
but I wanted the $100,000 more.
And look. Guess what.
We got both.
[laughs]
- Do you really think I'm upset
that I didn't get a cruise?
- The only thing
you keep saying is,
"I promised Alaska one thing,
and that was to bring her back
a trip."
- I'm doing an okay job,
but luckily,
Phi Phi does this a lot,
so I can do that
to cover the fact
that I don't know what
she's saying.
- It's bullshit.
- No, you're bullshit.
- [laughs]
- That was a lot better.
- Hell, yeah. That was fun.
- Our second scene is between
Jiggly and Lashauwn.
- I'm not here to make
best buddies, bitch.
This is not<i> RuPaul's</i>
<i>Best Friend Race.</i>
- No shit, Sherlock.
- Of course, I get to be
Lashauwn Beyond,
who has a little bit of problem
with her makeup.
I'm not saying that I do,
'cause I think I'm beautiful.
And then Monica
got to be Jiggly--
after the weight loss.
- If you lacking one thing
somebody else ain't lacking,
then shut the fuck up.
- I didn't say anything about
you going on the runway,
looking like that.
I said nothing about your look.
- Okay, really quick,
Monica,
you're fumbling a little bit
on the lines,
so when you're doing that,
just act up.
Just get nasty with it.
- Okay.
- If you lacking one thing...
- [muttering lines]
- Somebody else ain't lacking,
then shut the fuck up.
- Monica started
to talk her lines,
when we're supposed to be
lip-synching.
It kind of threw me off
a little bit.
I felt like I was just
letting you have it
'cause you didn't throw it back
at me.
Throw it back at me.
- This is not<i> RuPaul's</i>
<i>Best Friend Race.</i>
- No shit, Sherlock.
- Ew.
- I'm like, "Ugh,
I'm fucking it up."
I'm not focused, and I don't
have my 100% in this competition
because I have so much going on
in my head.
- I feel like Monica
gets a little bit nervous,
so I'm hoping that
she shakes out of that.
[dramatic music]
- Rolaskatox is in the building.
- Ding-dong!
- It's always a little tense
on elimination day.
- I do not want to be in
the fucking bottom.
- We won't be in the bottom.
I promise.
- We're sort of looking
around the room
to see who's gonna be on
the chopping block.
- Something's a little different
with Monica.
I'm not sure exactly what it is,
but there's something
on her mind.
You all right?
[sad music]
- I have so much on my mind,
and I don't want to be here.
I'm petrified to tell these
girls my huge secret.
I don't know how they're gonna
take it.
[crying]
It is hard being here.
- Listen, you're here
for a reason.
You could tell inside
she's just breaking down.
I don't think she's all here
at the competition.
[dramatic music]
- [laughing]
[music crescendos]
[RuPaul's<i> Cover Girl]</i>
And what?
[applause]
Welcome to the main stage
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
Michelle Visage.
- Darling, this is the best set
of queens yet.
- From your lips to God's ears,
darling.
- Mwah.
- Well, shut my mouth.
It's Santino Rice.
- Oof, my fair lady.
- Kristen Johnston,
how are you doing tonight?
- I can't believe it,
but I'm actually very attracted
to you right now.
- [laughs]
Juliette Lewis,
you look g-g-g-gorgeous.
- Thank you.
I'm happy to be here.
- This week,
our queens paid lip service
to<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> herstory.</i>
And tonight, they've come
dressed to impress.
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.
<i>Coming up...</i>
- The lip-synching was
completely off.
- What the "F"?
- I don't want to see boobs
when I'm at<i> Drag Race.</i>
- [laughing]
[laughing]
[electronic music]
-<i> Commence shakedown.</i>
- First up, Lineysha Sparx.
Gorgeous. Look at those legs.
- I'm looking Latina.
I feel<i> caribena.</i>
Totally flawless.
- I wore that at the beach
last week.
- [laughs]
I'll meet you at the cabana.
- [laughs]
Oh, yeah.
Honey Mahogany.
Caftan realness.
- I'm feeling pretty fierce.
This look is gonna slay
the judges.
- Juliette, is she wearing
a<i> Cape Fear?</i>
- [laughs]
- Hello!
- Ivy Winters.
Wow.
- Oh.
- Now, that's what I call
stiletto.
- Being a circus queen,
I decided to pull out my stilts,
and I did a butterfly goddess
look.
- Does anybody have a really big
butterfly net?
- [laughs]
- Mwah.
- Vivienne Pinay.
- She's got her own stilts.
Check 'em out.
- Yes.
Sissy that walk, honey.
- I'm wearing a sick gold dress,
low cut, very short,
looks fucking fierce.
- Little Grecian goddess.
- Oh, mighty Isis-is-is-is.
- [laughs]
- Alyssa Edwards.
- [barking]
- I think she's choking her dog.
- I have my clutch
in my left hand
and my baby chinchilla
in my right,
and I'm serving Rodeo Drive
fishness.
- She walks like
a dressage horse.
[laughter]
- Serena Chacha,
representing Panama.
- That's it.
- You can't even fit that
through the Panama Canal.
- Walking around
in this carnival costume
from the Republic of Panama
is a dream come true.
- Pants-off dance-off.
- [laughing]
Yeah.
- Jade Jolie.
It's the missing Ringling
sister.
- Screw the rainbows.
Give me leather.
- I'm serving up real
lion tamin' realness.
Bitch, send in the clowns.
- [laughs]
- Our little Jade
is all grown up.
Roxxxy Andrews.
If Cher had breastfed,
this is what she'd look like.
- I like to have the fringe
going down my boobicles
and on my booty and want to try
and win two times in a row.
- Tita Turtur.
- Turtur.
- Tina titties.
- [laughs]
- Jinkx Monsoon.
Hollywood glamour.
- Meets space.
- I am serving up
Hollywood 3012,
space-agey and beautiful.
- Very<i> 3rd Rock From the Sun.</i>
- Yes!
- Monica Beverly Hillz.
- Oh, yeah.
- Can you pay
my telephone bills?
- [laughs]
- My moneymaker is my face.
I know for a fact
that I'm beautiful.
- That is a nice ass.
- And it's not padded.
Natural-born thriller.
Alaska.
The 49th state.
- I'm trying to give sass
and flirt
and be cute
and sell this garment, sweetie.
- Party girl on her way home.
- Oops, I left my phone inside.
- Coco Montrese.
- This is Patti Labelle
meets Ziggy Stardust.
- Yes.
- Yes.
- I love fetish,
so I thought I'd give Santino
a little bit of something to
dream about tonight
while he's at home.
- You better "ass" somebody.
- Damn, girl.
Detox.
- Ohh.
- Snow White and the hunty man.
- Tonight I am wearing
an over-the-top gown
and feeling really sickening.
- How many black cocks
had to die for that outfit?
- [guffaws]
[laughing]
- Welcome, ladies.
Let's take a look
at your viral videos.
First up,
team Serena Chacha.
In the Interior Illusions
Lounge,
Shangela and Mariah
confronted Mimi Imfurst.
- You told them
you could do glamour
and you were high-fashion.
Do you feel that you delivered
that today?
That's the question.
- No, but I don't think
that was the challenge.
- Don't tiptoe
around the answer.
The thing is,
you just told us
that what you do is camp.
- You'll never be glamour.
- Boo, just 'cause
you got a sugar daddy
who pays for everything
for you--
- Ooh!
- I've never had a sugar daddy.
If I wanted a sugar daddy,
yes, I probably could go out
and get one,
because I am what?
Sickening, bitch!
- Hey, hey!
- No, no, no, no.
[laughter]
- Meanwhile, in the bar,
Delta gossiped with Raja.
- Manila was just that,
like, amalgamation
of every Asian stereotype.
- She was, like, Chinese,
Japanese,
dirty knees,
look at these.
Remember that?
- Right, like,
she's like a place in France
where the naked ladies dance.
- She was Cambodi-China-no.
- She was, like,
middle-America's interpretation
of Asian people, but when they
call them Oriental.
- [laughs]
I wonder if people talk about us
this way.
[coughs]
- All right.
[applause]
- Watching Serena was like
watching an old Chinese movie.
[silent]
- Next up, team Ivy Winters.
In the gold bar,
Tyra defended her singing,
which infuriated Tatianna.
- I'm not gonna replay it
because I already know
what happened,
and you already know
what happened.
- Okay, well, then--then
there's nothing else to say.
- I'm not replaying it with you
over and over again.
There isn't anything else
to say.
- But why are you talking?
- Why are<i> you</i><span style="bodyStyle"> talking?</i>
- Anyway, if you have a problem
with someone, address it.
And that's probably why
I seem like a bitch.
If I don't like you,
I don't like you.
- And I don't like you.
Are you happy?
I don't like you.
- I was not talking to you.
- I'm saying it to your face.
Then why are you looking
in my direction?
[laughter]
- Back in the lounge,
things were getting heated
between Morgan and Mystique.
- Go fix your hair.
- I don't need to.
- Fix your mug.
- I don't need to fix my mug,
bitch!
- Honey, you do need to fix
your mug.
- Sweetie.
- You have no manners.
- How do I have no--no manners?
- No class and no manners.
- No class, no manners?
You piss me off some more,
I will whoop your fucking ass.
Bitch, I am from Chicago.
[laughter and applause]
- I'm actually super confident
that I'm gonna be the winner
of the challenge
because I feel like
I turned it out.
- Next up, team Detox.
In the gold bar,
Jiggly was mad at Lashauwn.
- I'm not here to make
best buddies, bitch!
- Neither am I.
- I'm not here
to be your friend.
Then shut the fuck up!
You been everybody's B.F.F.
and ki-ki-ki-ki-ki-ki-ki.
No.
- Clearly, I don't get along
with you.
- That's fine.
I don't have to be your friend.
This is not<i> RuPaul's</i>
<i>Best Friend Race.</i>
- No shit, Sherlock.
- Back in the lounge,
Sharon defended herself
for calling Phi Phi O'Hara
cutthroat.
- I wasn't tarnishing your--
- Bullshit.
- I said you were cutthroat
and you hogged that
choreography, which is true.
- Because I'm fucking fierce,
and I'm good at what I do?
- No, you're the one
that fucking lied,
saying I'm just here for a trip.
We all know that's a joke.
- Bullshit.
Every fucking time.
It's bullshit.
- No, you're bullshit.
[laughter and applause]
- Oh, my lord.
- Ladies, you all did
an amazing job.
But one group was more
in synch than the others.
The winner of this week's
main challenge is...
[suspenseful music]
<i>Coming up...</i>
- Is that a prosthetic nose?
- You were like Chewbacca
in drag.
- Is this really your best drag?
- [sobbing]
- [laughing]
[laughing]
Ladies, one group was more
in synch than the others.
The winner is...
team Ivy Winters.
- Yay!
[laughs]
Yay.
- But one of you really
lip-smacked the competition...
Lineysha Sparx.
- [laughs]
- Oh.
[applause]
- You've won a couture latex
outfit from Siren Latex,
plus immunity from elimination
next week.
- [laughing]
- You may leave the stage.
- Yes.
- Ladies, it's time for
the judges' critiques.
Alyssa Edwards.
- Your Shangela lip-synching
was--
- Was better than Shangela.
[laughter]
- I do a bit of acting myself
on the side.
But I love
when people transform,
and I didn't recognize you.
- That's a good thing.
- Yeah.
- Serena Chacha.
- What the "F" was with that
little teeny flag?
You come out with this ginormous
thing and, like,
- The panties are almost<i> abuela,</i>
grandma panties.
And the lip-synching
was completely off.
- It was just kind of
uncomfortable to watch too.
- Roxxxy Andrews.
- Mariah--it was a
great lip-synch,
and you gave it
over-the-top Mariah-isms.
- With all the fringe
hanging down and the color,
I thought that you were like
Chewbacca in drag.
- [gasps]
- Shut up, Santino,
because that's perfection.
- [laughs]
- Come on.
- All right, Jinkx Monsoon.
- The hair was a little thirsty.
- I tried to tease it,
but I just pissed it off,
I know.
- [guffaws]
- Yeah, it's that--
- Your Mimi--I couldn't
take my eyes off you.
You're bananas,
and I love it.
- Jade Jolie.
- Your Delta--work!--
was hilar.
- Thank you.
- You should've practiced
with that whip, though,
a little bit more.
If you're gonna walk
with a whip,
you better crack that shit.
Am I allowed to say whip?
- [laughs]
- Just kidding.
- [laughs]
- Monica Beverly Hillz.
- Jiggly's probably
one of the biggest characters,
and you let that
completely go away.
- Also, on your runway as well,
I don't know, maybe you're sad
today or it's a hard day.
You're kind of disconnected.
- Monica, tell me.
What's on your mind?
- It's true,
what you're saying.
There is a lot
going through my head.
I feel I'm not here.
[crying]
I've just been
holding a secret in
and trying so hard, and--
- What secret?
[sad music]
- I'm not just a drag queen.
I'm a transgendered woman.
Ever since I got here,
I've been lying to myself
and to other people.
[sobbing]
I'm a transgender woman.
The only way I'm gonna be able
to give 100%, if I come clean.
I feel like I'm not
being myself.
Every day is hard.
- I invited you here
because you are fierce.
You deserve to be here,
and that's why you're here.
You have to believe in yourself,
and the only person
who does not believe is you.
Stay strong,
Monica Beverly Hillz.
- I will.
- I think she's here now.
- I think you're here too.
- It felt good to say that.
- Monica has been through
everything.
Right now, she's my hero.
She's the strongest girl
in this competition.
- All right.
Alaska, the 49th state.
- Hi.
- The Phi Phi--
- Is this really your best drag?
- This is actually Detox's
best drag.
- [guffaws]
[laughter and applause]
Coco Montrese.
- I think everything
is flawless.
You're yummy.
- If it ever comes down
to lip-synching against Coco,
I fear for each and every
one of you
because she is no joke.
- Thank you so much.
- Your Sharon Needles scared me.
- [laughing]
- And that's hard.
- You've been around
a little bit,
I can tell, right?
- Oh, what are you
trying to say?
- Been there, done that.
Just a little vibe of that
coming from you.
Just loosen up a little bit
on everything.
- It's a shock to hear
that I'm overconfident.
This is something that I've been
wanting to do for years,
and to finally be here,
I'm humbled.
- Well, my queens,
I think we've heard enough.
While you enjoy
an Absolut cocktail
in the Interior Illusions
Lounge,
the judges and I
will deliberate.
[engine revs]
All right, now,
just between us "goyls"...
Alyssa Edwards.
- She revealed
this whole other talent
with the lip-synching.
- I love her mouth so much.
It's very hard for me
to take everything else in.
I get hypnotized.
- All right, Serena Chacha.
- I have a special place
in my heart for Raja,
and she got nothing right.
Don't swim in the big pond
until you got your little
floaties on, girlfriend.
- I see improvement.
Is it enough improvement?
I'm not sure.
- Roxxxy Andrews.
- Her performance as Mariah,
it was spot-on.
- Yeah.
- But I don't want to see boobs.
I mean--
- Why are you sitting
next to Michelle, then?
- I don't want to see boobs
when I'm at<i> Drag Race.</i>
- Jinkx Monsoon.
- This is not meant
to be offensive,
but is that a prosthetic nose
tonight?
- No, that is her real nose.
- Oh, my God.
- So do you think that,
the way she shaded it,
it looked almost
Alice the Goon-ish?
- Yeah.
- That said,
she's certainly the best actress
up there.
I mean, she's phenomenal.
- Jade Jolie.
- Had it not been for
her portrayal of Delta,
that whole thing would've been
unwatchable.
- I'm a little bored.
You know, come on.
Fat suit, funny.
- Monica Beverly Hillz,
who confessed to us
that she actually is
in the middle of transitioning.
- Good for her.
I think she looks great.
She's gonna have a great life.
- But she didn't embody
any Jiggly.
She could've gone all the way
and blacked out some teeth.
- Yes!
You could've even done
her expression,
you know, that, like--
- [guffaws]
- I don't see the performer.
- Alaska.
- Her Phi Phi was fantastic.
- I actually think her
performance really failed.
I thought it was over the top
in not a funny way.
- Coco Montrese.
- She is such a badass.
The lip-synching she had down
to a tee.
- Her Lashauwn was beyond
Lashauwn.
- Detox.
- Flawless and beautiful.
- It just didn't do it for me.
She didn't do it for me.
She kind of feels like
she's figured it all out.
You love her.
We get it.
- No, I love all of them.
- Silence!
I've made my decision.
- Thank God.
- [mumbles incoherently]
- [laughs]
- [laughing]
[laughing]
Welcome back, ladies.
Based on your performances
in this week's challenge
and on the main stage,
I've made some decisions.
[suspenseful music]
Monica Beverly Hillz,
please step forward.
Serena Chacha.
Monica,
your performance this week
was a little too Jiggly
and not enough caliente.
And, Serena,
as team leader,
you forgot to cover
your own ass.
I'm sorry, my dears, but you are
both up for elimination.
The rest of you...
may join the other girls.
- It was no surprise to me
that I was gonna be
on the bottom two.
[sighs] I should've said
something earlier.
- Bottom two again.
Fuck my life.
- Two queens stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me,
to save yourself
from elimination.
The time has come...
to lip-synch...
for your life.
- Sorry, Serena.
I'm gonna lip-synch
for my motherfucking life.
- Good luck.
And don't fuck it up.
-<i> I think I'm the bigger</i>
<i>contender, honestly.</i>
<i>I think I have a lot more</i>
<i>than she has.</i>
-<i> Oh, my God.</i>
Serena did a split.
Oh, wait, she did that
last time.
- Monica is slaying the hell
out of Serena,
and I'm very happy.
Serena can get the hell out of
here.
- [laughing]
Whoa!
[laughter and applause]
- Ladies,
I've made my decision.
Monica Beverly Hillz,
shantay, you stay.
- [exhales]
- You may join the other girls.
- Thank you.
- Serena Chacha,
you are a young
and talented queen
with so much more
to show the world.
Keep on keeping on, Pana-mama.
Now sashay away.
- Thank you.
It sucks.
I feel like there was a lot more
to offer.
But there's nothing
I would change,
except for not being
team captain.
To the other queens,
pick up a book and go read.
- One dozen queens,
one step closer
to becoming America's
next drag superstar.
Now remember,
if you can't love yourself,
how in the hell
you gonna love somebody else?
Can I get an amen up in here?
- All: Amen!
- Now let the music play.
[RuPaul's<i> The Beginning]</i>


<i> Previously on</i>
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race...</i>
Welcome to the new<i> Snatch Game.</i>
 Get your life!
 I can never tell if it's pâté
or if it's giblets for the cats.
 [laughs]
 I just wrote "anus."
 Flip her hair back and forth.
 You're at the<i> Snatch Game,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
honey.
 What's that?
 This is about to get real
ugly.
 Girl, look how orange you
fucking look.
 I'm not joking, bitch!
 I'm not getting "glamour."
 To me, this looks glamorous.
 Celia Cruz
was really generic.
 Jinkx Monsoon, you are the
winner of this week's challenge.
 Thank you very much.
 Detox, shante, you stay.
Lineysha, sashay away.
 [groaning]
 We see Lineysha's message,
and we're all really sad.
We're gonna miss her.
 "Latino shade!"
 Beautiful, crafty lady.
both: She was.
 Detox, how did it
feel up there?
 Girl, you don't even
want to know.
I will never be
in the bottom two again.
Just makes me want to step my
game up even more.
<i>Jinxalicious.</i>
 It was an amazing
performance.
Congratulations.
 Thank you.
 Don't count out Tamar,
bitch!
 What about Tamar?
 [singing]
 Even though I'm doing well,
I'm not really getting the same
kind of emphatic reaction
from the rest of the queens
that members
of Rolaskatox get
when they do well.
 Rolaskatox is firmly intact
and ready for the kill.
 Oh, here we go with that
shit again.
 I am in it to win it.
To dismiss me, right now,
would be a bad move
on their part
because you should be
taking me as a threat.
[snores]
<i> The winner of</i>
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race receives</i>

 At this point,
it's all or nothing.
It's balls to the walls,

[siren wails]
<i> Ooh, girl!</i>
<i>You got shemail.</i>
My queens...
a ladyboy needs to give
till it hurts.
 [laughs]
 So whether you're saving
the whales
or saving face,
America's next drag superstar
needs to get by with a little
help from her friends...
with benefits.
all: What?
 Hello, hello, hello.
all: Hi.
 Now,
in my illustrious career,
I've had to put on my makeup
without a mirror
or during a power blackout.
So for today's mini-challenge,
you have to apply your makeup
in total darkness.
[laughter]
 I am losing confidence
in myself doing makeup
in the light.
[groans]
 Oh, and ladies,
thanks to these
night vision goggles,
I'll be watching
your every move.
all: Oh!
 Lights out.
all: Oh!
 Oh, my god.
 Oh!
 A table.
 What is this?
 Oh, my god. Ow.
 Whoop, that went into
my eyeball.
 It's all fun and games
till the looting starts.
 Miss Coco, how are you going
to blend your powders?
[laughter]
 Oh, really, Miss Detox?
 I'm certain that,
whether it's light or dark,
Alyssa is still making this face
in the mirror.
 Ladies, I'm watching you.
 Hmm, interesting.
Very interesting.
All right.
[clapping hands]
Lights up!
[all sighing]
 Ooh!
 Do you remember
where we parked the car?
 All right, first up,
Jinkx Monsoon.
Oh, dear god!
 [mock crying]
 Are you ready to take a peek?
 I think I'm ready
for a funeral.
 Whose?
 My career's.
 Oh.
Next up, Detox.
Ooh!
Actually, you look
kind of gorgeous.
I bet you get dressed
in the dark a lot.
Alyssa Edwards.
all: Ooh!
 It's kind of gorgeous.
Alyssa, we're still here, hon.
Over here.
Ivy Winters.
[gasps]
Wow.
It's very drama-filled.
 Yeah.
 Roxxxy Andrews.
Nice, take a look.
 Oh, no, ma'am.
 Jade Jolie.
Ooh!
Young boy, first time in drag?
Miss Coco Montrese.
You've got that highlight under
those eyes, don't ya?
 That's bad, Ru.
 Well...
laughs]
 Girl, what was those colors?
 Alaska.
[both screaming]
No, it looks perfect to me.
[laughter]
The winner is...
Detox.
Face, face.
Ladies, it's always darkest
before the dawn,
and now it's time to share
your light with the world.
Now back in the '80s,
music's biggest superstars
formed super-groups,
like "Band Aid"
and "USA for Africa."
They lifted spirits
and raised money.
So for today's main challenge,
you'll be writing and recording
the newest inspirational anthem.
Can I get an amen?
all: Amen.
 No, I mean, actually
that's the name of the song:
<i>Can I Get an Amen?</i>
[laughter]
Yeah.
Now, you'll be writing lyrics
in three teams.
Detox, since you won
the mini-challenge,
you get to decide the teams.
[laughter]
So who's your first
team of three?
Alaska and Roxxxy,
get your asses over here.
 Rolaskatox formation.
 Formation.
[laughs]
Okay, and I think
that the rest of the groups
are already
paired together...
 Oh.
 The way that I want them.
 Oh, oh.
 So we have Jade, Ivy,
and Jinkx.
And we've got Coco and Alyssa.
 You are a shady bitch.
Me and Alyssa had a very heated
argument,
and these girls know that.
 I'm a little thrown.
Once again, here we go.
 You can see
the storm clouds gathering.
[imitates cat hissing, snarling]
 All right, ladies.
Later, you'll be recording with
my producer, Lucian Piane.
[cheers and applause]
 And the dress code?
Flashback, '80s ladies.
[cheering]
All right, gentlemen,
start your engines.
And may the best woman win.
 Do we want to start it off,
olr do we want...
 Yeah.
 If Coco's gonna act like that
when I give her a team,
then show me what you can do
with this fucking first verse.
Have at it.
Okay, so Alyssa and Coco,
you guys are gonna do verse one.
Jinkx, Jade, and Ivy,
you guys are gonna do verse two.
 Okay.
 And then, Rolaskatox,
we're gonna be doing the bridge.
Listen to this a few times
and get to work.
That's all.
 "You guys are
the first verse."
Which means we'll be
the first take.
I'm so over these girls.
I'm done.
 What's the "T"?
 I don't need y'all
to gang up on me.
You, you, or you.
 I wasn't instigating shit.
 [giggles]
[laughs]
 The challenge for this week
is to write lyrics
to a "save the world"-inspired
drag anthem.
We have to have an '80s look
put together,
and we have to perform the song
in front of Lucian.
It's a doozy.
I'm gonna alter
some of these words.
Can I get an amen?
That would make it funny.
 No.
This--oh, this is horrible.
I need to finish this.
 I feel like Coco's over it.
And it's kind of
wearing me down.
I'm trying to overcompensate
for not having a voice,
and I'm really channeling
my inner<i> Glee</i><span style="bodyStyle"> personality.</i>
 Let's start throwing out
some--
just, like,
some one-liners.
 I like the "rhinestones are
a girl's best friend."
Then you say, "They're cheap."
 Um...
I need my headphones.
I would have been really fine
if it was just Jinkx and myself.
 Lately, like,
I've been feeling like Jade
just needs to
step it up a little bit.
 Just keep your head up
and you can achieve.
 It's so close.
 We don't have to rhyme
the last line with anything.
 Oh, it doesn't?
 No.
 When your own friends
don't believe in you,
it makes you just kind of,
like, second guess yourself.
So I'm just feeling
a little underestimated again.
 I'm not worried whatsoever
about myself
or Rolaskatox.
 [scat singing]
 We're gonna fucking
nail it.
I have an idea for a line
that I think
we should put in somewhere.
[laughter]
[wails]
 I love Roxxxy and Detox
as friends...
 But the importance of me
sticking out from the pack
is extremely huge
right now
because I'm the only part
of Rolaskatox
who hasn't won a challenge.
 Can I get an amen?
 Hello, hello, hello.
all: Hello!
 How are my little
singer-songwriters doing?
 All right.
Coco and Alyssa.
 Hi, Ru.
 Cocolyssa.
Now, who sings?
 I'm gonna try to take it to
church a little bit.
 All right, what about you,
Alyssa?
 I don't know if I'm gonna be
able to take it to church.
I may take it down the street
to the Jack in the Box.
 Can I hear a little bit?
 Yeah, you can.
 Whoa, okay.
 We got auto-tune?
 All righty, then.
 Can we get auto-tune?
 Alyssa in
a dancing challenge,
she's bringing home the trophy.
Alyssa in a singing challenge...
she ain't bringing home shit.
 Now how is this gonna
inspire people
in the context of your song?
 We did ours kind of towards
straight people, you know?
 Oh.
both: "Lost and confused.
"I had to smile deep within.
When I realized
these women were men."
 Um, look at those
lyrics again
and put some fun in there.
All right, kids,
you get back to work.
I cannot wait to hear
the finished product.
 Okay.
 Ivy, Jade, and Jinkx.
[overlapping greetings]
 It's like Wilson Phillips is
back together.
Now, who sings in the group?
 I grew up singing, doing,
like, classical music.
I was classically trained.
 I sing professionally,
actually.
 What about you, Jade?
 I sing in the car.
I think I'm just gonna have to
freestyle it and just...
 Well, this is a competition.
You know, you got to plan
something out.
 Jade?
She's just kind of floating by.
 Jinkx, you and Michelle
aren't coming together
on a style angle.
What do you think that's about?
 I think we used the word
"glamour" in different ways.
But I think this next runway,
I'm going to get right on there.
 There's a lot
of show-stopping queens
around here.
You need to steal the spotlight.
All right, get back to work,
and I cannot wait to see you.
 [sighs]
 Rolaskatox.
 What's going on?
 Hey.
You're doing the bridge
and the last chorus.
What message have you
all written?
 Now, you're gonna make this
the g-rated version, right?
All right,
get back to work,
and we'll see you out there.
 Thank you, Ru.
 All right.
All right, ladies,
gather around, my children.
Tomorrow, on the main stage,
we will debut your
<i>Can I Get an Amen?</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
music video.
And our extra-special guest
judges will be
three amazing women
who appeared on the original
<i>We are the World:</i>
Anita and Ruth,
the Pointer Sisters.
[cheers and applause]
And La Toya Jackson
will be here.
 La Toya!
 Oh, my god.
So excited to have them here
when I know I'm
on top of my game.
 And for the runway, I want
you to put together a look
that shows off
your favorite body part.
 Oh.
 'Cause, honey, if you can't
love your body part,
how in the hell you gonna--
well, you get
the picture.
Just don't fuck it up.
Okay?
All right.
I'll see you later.
 Coco, there's a lot of
pressure on you
to start this out.
 Yeah.
It's great.
Thanks, Detox.
 For what?
 [giggles]
[laughs]
 Ooh.
 Amen.
 The main challenge
for this week
is to record a song about
how drag can save people's lives
and change the world.
 Hello, ladies.
all: Hi.
 Okay.
We're recording the track,
and we're recording
a live video.
Coco, there's a lot of pressure
on you to start this out.
 Yeah.
 All right.
 It's great.
Thanks, Detox.
 What, honey?
 I said, "Thank you."
 For what?
 Nothing.
Go ahead.
 Is something wrong?
 No. Not at all.
 Well, apparently there is.
What's going on?
 We're ready.
 Yeah, I'm pissed off.
I'm the first one up.
I'm nervous as hell.
 Cue track.
[lyrical music]
 You lost all hope there,
didn't you?
You literally did.
Okay.
 Coco, remember to use your
headphone in the other ear.
For the camera.
Got to see your beautiful face.
[lyrical music]
 Uh, missed my cue, sorry.
[laughs]
 Just catch up.
 Coco, what's going on?
 I'm good.
 Coco and Alyssa had
very strange chemistry.
They seemed like
they were on different planes.
Let's move on.
[lyrical music]
 Why are you looking down
and, like, not performing?
 Sorry.
[laughs] I was just trying
to focus on the words.
 Confidence and owning it
is a good idea.
 That was awesome.
Ivy, great job.
Ivy's got the energy,
the performance,
and the voice.
 I feel that Jinkx
is the weakest
because all these girls
with the gimmicks
are getting by, and it's kind of
pissing me off.
[glass shattering]
 You guys have the bridge,
so you know this is, like, the
most inspired part of the song.
 Uh-huh.
 Are you saying "sequin" or--
 Sequinsed dress.
 "Sequin dress," I think is
what you mean.
 I say "sequinsed dress."
"Sequinsed" is more than one
sequins.
A "sequins" is one little
circle shiny little sequins.
Is it wrong English?
Sequin?
A sequin is one.
Sequins is plural?
Sequinsed.
Oh, fuck.
 Detox, don't swear during
a recording take.
 We'll stop there.
Both of you are doing what,
right there?
 The second part.
 No, are you crazy?
 [laughs]
 You guys changed keys
before the song changes keys.
Just--ugh--a train wreck.
 [laughs]
 Detox and Roxxxy
are joking around too much,
not taking it seriously.
That's unacceptable.
 So now it's time to do
some freestyling
over the choruses, ladies.
Do whatever you think works.
 [laughs]
 I'm going Beyoncé
on Destiny's Child.
I can't be Kelly Rowland.
[wailing]
 Next.
 Give yourself a big round
of applause.
That's a wrap, ladies.
 Ah!
 Whoo!
 "Love yourself."
 That was so much fun.
 Girl, I thought you was about
to go off.
 No, girl.
 Do you feel like
she was instigating it?
 Yeah.
And then try to play like,
"Oh, I didn't do anything."
 What's the "T"?
 I'm fine.
I'm totally fine.
 Well, I was thinking if
you're gonna say my name,
you've been throwing
dust and shade.
 I said, "Thank you."
All I said was,
"Thank you, Detox."
 Well, thank you for
what though, miss thing?
 Well, she feels like
you were instigating.
 I wasn't instigating shit.
I'm not trying to be dusty.
I'm not trying to sabotage
anybody in this competition.
If you feel that way,
I'm sorry you feel that way,
'cause that's not the case.
 I'm giving dust,
I'm giving this.
I ain't said a word.
I'm just standing here.
 You haven't said a word,
but you said a lot to Alyssa
this whole--
 I don't need y'all
to gang up on me.
You, you, or you.
 Miss thing, I'm not ganging
up on anybody.
 I don't need that.
 I'm not ganging up
on anybody.
 I said what I had to say.
 When you're on stage
and you say,
"Thank you, detox,"
snotty like that--
when I see this and I see
eyeballs flying at me,
I'm gonna fucking say something.
 Girl, I didn't even
look at you.
Who eyeballs were flying at you?
'Cause my eyeballs
didn't fly nowhere.
 Coco always wants to say
that she's very positive
and looks at the best
of everything.
 Oh, my god.
 Yet she's been
playing the victim
the last couple of weeks,
and I'm just
pretty much over it.
 Ro!
 Laska!
 Tox!
 The theme for today's runway
is "best body part."
It's imperative for me to burn
the building with the look,
because Coco wasn't herself,
I'm not a singer,
and I didn't come to
this competition
to be in the bottom three.
 What are you featuring today?
 I'm gonna show off
my whole body.
I've had so much done
to my body,
I might as well show it off.
 What all have you had done?
 I have had a little bit
of plastic surgery
here and there.
I've had my hips
and my ass done.
I've had my pecs done.
Underneath my eyes done
and my brow area done.
My six-pack done.
 You've had a six-pack done
with silicone?
 Uh-huh.
My cheeks done and my lips done.
My chin done,
and my jawline done.
My shoulders, I've had--
 Your shoulders?
 My muscles are all silicone.
And then I've had a little bit
done on my bicep here.
 [laughs]
You're a silicone maniac.
 The only thing I haven't
had done
is my knees and my nose
and my big toe.
I'm like walking tupperware,
girl.
I'm part of the Glad family
of products.
[laughter]
 How do I feel about queens
who've had plastic surgery?
Jealous.
If I had my way,
my upper lip would
look like this.
 It wasn't
the most pleasant experience
for coming out for me.
[laughs]
 Did you have anyone
in your family
who was supportive of you?
 It really, like, ruined
my world for a while.
I had, like, really
dark times as a kid.
I parted from my family.
We parted on bad terms,
and I really just
didn't have anyone.
I didn't have any friends.
I didn't have anybody.
I was just very lost.
And I wasn't happy with myself.
 You don't need to waste time
trying to impress the people
who aren't gonna accept you
for who you are.
 Right.
And I think when you get older,
you just really appreciate
things so much more.
You know what I mean?
Like, I'm glad that--you
know, I don't regret anything.
I pride myself on
where I'm at now
and the person that I've become.
I'm much stronger,
and I love myself much more.
You know, when Ru says,
"You have to love yourself",
you definitely do, so...
'cause if you don't love
yourself,
how the hell are you gonna love
anyone else?
[laughs]
 I thought that Detox
was trying to be
a little malicious
when she put us together.
 [laughs]
[RuPaul's<i> Cover Girl]</i>
 Welcome to the main stage of
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
Michelle Visage,
can drag change the world?
 Yes, just you and me.
 [laughs]
Santino Rice?
 We're gonna make music
her-story tonight.
It's Anita and Ruth,
the Pointer Sisters.
"I'm so excited."
 Oh, and you better
not hide it.
 And my queen,
Miss La Toya Jackson.
Third time as a judge.
 That's right, three times.
And it never gets a dull moment
when I look at you.
 How's life with La Toya?
 You'll see.
 Good.
This week,
our queens were challenged
to record and perform
an inspirational anthem.
And tonight,
they're ready to wow us
with their favorite body part.
Ooh.
Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best woman win.
Commence shakedown.
First up, Coco Montrese.
It takes a lot of guts to wear
that outfit.
 I'm giving them a Coco
they've never seen.
I'm showing off my heart.
 She's got a "heart on"
for you.
 I love that little shy thing
she does like Prince.
[laughs]
 Alyssa Edwards.
She's showing off her poochy.
She's not ashamed.
 I'm showing off my legs,
and they are wearing
the runway out.
 That's how you wear
that caftan dress.
 That's what I'm saying.
Take that, Honey Mahogany.
 Jade Jolie, rainbow bright.
 I'm featuring my arms.
I try not to carry over
5 pounds,
so I'm very proud to have
the petite arms that I have.
 She forgot to shave.
[laughs]
 Ivy Winters.
 Ivy's a real pinup.
 I decided to make a dress
completely out of paper,
pictures of my face.
[laughs]
 I love that dress!
Just don't get near
the shredder.
 No.
 Or an open flame.
 Jinkx Monsoon.
 It reminds me of
the really old Hollywood movies.
The glamour movies.
 My look tonight
is rich, white bitch.
And my attitude tonight
is so over it.
 Waiter, can you wrap
that ass to go?
[laughter]
Roxxxy Andrews.
 Bam!
 Oh, hey!
 An element of surprise.
 Give me body.
 I've learned to love
every single piece of my body,
and I want them to see it.
 She's so shy.
No, she's not.
 Ooh.
 Alaska.
 That sweet little girl
who caught our eye.
 Well, I was going to come out
in ass-less chaps,
but they were at the cleaners.
So I'm showing off
this bone right here.
 There is purple ice
in Alaska.
 [laughs]
 Yes.
 Hi.
Detox.
It's just so simple and elegant.
 I know.
 It's a simple--
all: Oh!
 Say "yes" to crack.
 The minute I turn around
and show them that ass, honey,
it was
Body-ody-ody realness.
 She got that dress
from her crack dealer.
 Peek-a-ru!
I see you.
 [laughs]
 Welcome, ladies.
It's my honor to present
the world premiere of
<i>Can I Get an Amen?</i>
[synthesizer fanfare]
[piano music]
 [laughs]
 Nice work, ladies.
The single is available
on iTunes.
And a portion of the proceeds
will go
to the L.A. Gay &amp; Lesbian
Center's
homeless youth services.
Yes.
Now it's time for
the judges' critiques.
 How do you tuck your junk?
[both laugh]
 No!
Worry about you!
 [giggles]
 [laughs]
Ladies, this week
you worked as teams,
but tonight you'll be judged
individually.
Starting with Coco Montrese.
 I was a little confused
with the top.
I wasn't sure what it was
showing me.
 Coco, we lost you
in that number.
 I know that the two of you
have had your differences
in the past.
What was it like working
together as a group?
 I thought that Detox
was trying to be
a little malicious
when she put us together.
 Truly, I was not.
I just think that you got
in your head
a little bit too much
yesterday.
 Coco, you have to stay
grounded in your own foundation.
All right.
Alyssa Edwards.
 You are absolutely gorgeous.
Your singing...
[laughs]
That's kind of a bit different.
[both laugh]
 It's clear you do not sing,
but that did not stop you.
You were very funny
and still in it.
 Next up, Jade Jolie.
 The singing, it was a little
bit of a let down.
 It was almost as if you were
dying for this song to get over.
 I don't know what's going on
here,
hair coming out of the hips,
hair coming out of a boob.
What?
 Next up, Ivy Winters.
 Hi, mama.
 I love your dress.
 Thank you.
 Are those your pictures
on there?
 They're all my face,
body shots.
 Oh, that is so clever.
 You can carry a tune as well.
I liked your harmonies the best.
You stood out.
 Next up, Jinkx Monsoon.
 I love the way you held that
long note.
That just put all the icing
on the cake for me.
 Look, I'm gonna give you
a tip.
You don't need to contour
so hard.
Though we have
a touch of crazy in us,
you don't need to
look it.
 Next up, Roxxxy Andrews.
One question.
Is that your skin color?
Is that all painted on?
 That's peanut butter.
 Yes.
 Peanut butter.
 Peanut butter, peanut butter.
 It was so hot from the moment
you stepped out there.
And when you threw that
cape off, it was on, honey.
 In the video, as a group,
it was rough, because
no one was harmonizing
and it got
a little monotonous.
 What's going on with you
and Detox?
 Rolaskatox.
 You got this little sisterly
thing going on?
 We're just becoming
best of friends,
and Alaska as well.
 Remember, this is
a competition.
Cliques can be dangerous.
 All right, next up, Detox.
 Stunning shape tonight,
and a real payoff
when you turned around.
 I get worried about you
relying on crutches.
Last week you lip synched for
your life,
and you did
your little jaw thing,
and it's funny.
Let's not kill it.
 All right.
Who's gonna ask her?
Al-as-ka!
 Hi.
 I loved the lyric
when you said,
I think it was,
"tuck my junk"?
Yeah, I--
How do you tuck your junk?
 After the show,
I can show you.
 [laughs]
 I'm almost getting bored.
Something's missing, Alaska.
In your singing performance,
you were hiding behind glasses,
almost so we don't
get to see you.
I don't know why
you're holding back.
Don't worry about your group,
whoever you're with.
No!
Worry about you!
We want to see what Alaska has.
Bring it.
 I get a sense that you hide
behind shticky character.
There's a level of vulnerability
that you're not allowing us
to see.
You are in a relationship with
Sharon Needles,
and she's got the shtick,
but there is a heart there.
And I want to get to the heart
of Alaska.
Are you hearing any of that?
 I'm...
um, I need to show you
the real me
and--and show that
to you every time.
To hear that I don't have
a heart,
and I don't have vulnerability,
that's extremely hard
for me to hear.
 All right, ladies,
while you untuck
in the Interior Illusions
lounge,
the judges and I
will deliberate.
All right.
Just between us siblings,
what do you think?
Let's start with Coco Montrese.
 Child, that highlighter
was higher and lighter
than I've seen in many a time.
 Yes.
 I don't think she's focused,
and that's her problem.
The stronger people are gonna
take over
and win at the end of the day,
and that's what's happening
right here.
 Alyssa Edwards.
 I loved her look tonight.
She was showcasing legs
and face.
 She does that walk.
Every time she goes somewhere,
she points to the...
 Yes.
 Spot she's gonna go to.
 "I'm going over here."
"Now I'm going over here."
"Back here."
 I love it.
 Her singing was
a little off balance.
 She's not a great singer.
Don't judge me!
Don't judge me!
 But I think she compensated
for that with her movement.
 Let's move on to Jade Jolie.
Oh, my goodness, that outfit.
 It just was a miss
on so many levels.
I don't even know
where to begin.
 I don't really remember
her vocals.
I guess I wasn't impressed.
 Forgettable.
Just forgettable.
 Moving on to Ivy Winters.
 Tonight, on the runway,
was very creative.
 I like when she added
the harmony to the song.
I thought that was very good.
 The girl can sing.
She really surprised me.
 Jinkx Monsoon.
 There was, like, 20 different
eras going on tonight
in this glamour.
The belt was from the '80s,
the dress was, like, the '50s.
There are so many things
that are consistently a mess.
 But she can sing.
Jinkx has some pipes.
 Very strong and powerful.
Liked it very much.
 Roxxxy Andrews.
 When it comes to sexy,
she was the top for me.
 She could not sing a lick,
and that did not stop her.
She was hilarious.
 Moving on to Detox.
 She kind of phoned it in
in the song department.
 Can't remember
the performance.
The dress just
took my mind away.
 [laughs]
 Crack is back,
and that was that.
 Alaska.
 Every time
she comes out here,
she's got the same
little wiggle,
the same little, "Hi."
I'm bored.
 I think, truthfully,
that she's given us all she has.
Michelle, this is probably it.
Remember,
we're paring everybody off,
and the competition's getting
really strict and hard now.
 Silence!
I've made my decision.
Bring back my girls,
and, uh, can I get an amen?
all: Amen.
 All right.
[giggles]
[laughs]
Welcome back, ladies.
I've made some decisions.
This week's winner is...
Ivy Winters.
[applause]
You've won a Flight 001 package.
Luggage for the queen on the go.
 Thank you so much.
I'm so excited that I won
this challenge,
and I proved to the judges
that I am here for a reason.
 Jinkx Monsoon, you're safe.
 Thank you.
 Roxxxy Andrews.
You are safe.
 Thank you.
 Detox.
You're safe.
But--
and it's a big butt--
 [laughs]
 We expect more from you.
You may join the other girls.
Alaska, you've been coasting
on kooky,
and we want you to go deeper.
You're safe.
Coco Montrese,
this week you wore your heart
on your sleeve
but your mind got
the better of you.
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
Alyssa Edwards, your singing
proved you are...
an amazing dancer.
 [laughs]
 Jade Jolie, you light up
our lives,
but this week, you let the other
queens outshine you.
Jade Jolie,
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
Alyssa Edwards, you are safe.
You may join the other girls.
Two queens stand before me.
Prior to tonight,
you were asked to prepare
a lip-synch performance of
<i>I'm So Excited</i>
by the legendary
Pointer Sisters.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me
and save yourself
from elimination.
The time has come for you to
lip-synch for your life.
 Everything that I didn't give
in that video,
I have to pull it
and give it right now
'cause this is my last chance.
 Good luck.
And don't fuck it up.
[disco music]
 I'm spinning, I'm kicking.
I'm high energy and fun.
I'm just laying everything
on the table.
 I can't underestimate Jade.
She wants this just as bad
as I do.
I've got to give this my all.
 Whoo!
[applause]
 Yeah!
 Ladies, I've made
my decision.
Coco Montrese,
shante, you stay.
You may join the other girls.
Jade, I'm so proud of you.
 Thank you so much.
This has been the most amazing
experience in my life.
[cries]
 Keep being<i> tres</i><span style="bodyStyle"> jolie.</i>
 Girl, I will.
 Now, sashay away.
 Thank you, guys.
I gave it my all,
and if anyone was gonna
send me home,
at least it was a close friend.
This has been so amazing,
and I'm just gonna keep going
and be more fabulous
than I've ever been.
 My drag-nificent seven,
remember.
If you can't love yourself,
how in the hell you gonna love
somebody else?
Can I get an amen up in here?
all: Amen.
 All right.
Let the music play.
[RuPaul's<i> The Beginning]</i>


- Previously
on<i> RuPaul's Drag Race...</i>
We're throwing the first ever
Sugar Ball.
[all gasp]
Are you passionate about
becoming America's next drag
superstar?
- You're wrong, Jinkx,
on the lollipop.
- Roxxxy's grasping at straws
to try to shake me.
- Jinkx, your sweet 16 party
girl--16 going on 47.
- It's unfortunate that there's
a disconnect
and it makes me question
your taste level.
- Alaska, you're the winner
of this week's challenge.
- [squeals]
- Jinkx Monsoon...
shantay, you stay.
Detox, sashay away.
- [whimpers]
- Holy shit.
- Detox just went home.
This has been the hardest
elimination for me.
My baby.
- What giant lips she has.
- If I was
on that judges' panel,
Jinkx would have been gone.
Jinkx does not deserve
to be here.
No offense, Jinkx, but I know
what they were saying about
looking 70 'cause you did look
a little older.
- But that's how Jinkx Monsoon
would have looked.
She would have been 16
in the '70s.
I know Roxxxy is upset that she
doesn't get to go through this
last part of the competition
with her best friend.
But I'm not gonna stop fighting
for this
until the very, very end.
- One of the three of us is
going to win $100,000.
- How many challenges have you
won, Jinkx?
- Two. We've all won two.
- You've won two and I've won
two.
- Ooh, an even playing ground
except I've never lip-synced.
I'm coming right off winning
last week's challenge.
So I just say bring it on,
darling.
Alaska is back in full force.
- Alaska thinks she can just
slide right underneath the radar
and go for the crown.
But guess what, bitch.
I'm not gonna let that happen.
Alaska, my dear, sashay away.
- Words you will never hear.
- The winner
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
receives a sickening supply
of Colorevolution cosmetics,
a luxury trip courtesy
of ALandCHUCK.travel,
headline Logo's Drag Race tour
featuring Absolut vodka--
cocktails perfected--and a cash
prize of $100,000.
- Top three, fantasy.
- Top three,
fantasy.
Where my top three at?
- [sighs] Aw, look.
I have a note.
- Oh, my gosh.
A little note from Detoxy.
- It says, "Roxxxy, this was
such an amazing journey
and I'm so thankful to have made
it with you."
- Mine says, "Lasky, you're
fucking terrible.
I love you so much."
- And--and I didn't get a note.
[laughs]
- You didn't get a note?
- No.
- Well, here. I'll make one up
from Detox to you.
"Jinkx, you sent me home,
you fucking hot fucking mess."
[laughs]
[alarm blares]
- Ooh, girl.
You've got shemail.
Ladies, make a case why you
should be America's
next drag superstar and you
could be awarded
a judgment of $100,000.
And if you're really lucky,
you might even get a hung jury.
- What?
- Hello, hello, hello.
[all squeal]
- She has legs.
- And I know how to use 'em.
- [laughs]
- The final three!
Condragulations.
[all cheer]
RuPaul is getting some
last-minute cosmetic procedures.
So he asked me to tell you
all about your final challenge.
And it's a doozy.
This week, you'll be starring
with RuPaul
in the official music video
for<i> The Beginning.</i>
- [squeals]
- You'll be working with
choreographer Candis Cayne.
- Continental.
- And then, with director
Mathu Andersen,
you'll be shooting a dramatic
courtroom scene.
And each of you will be playing
defendant,
defense attorney,
and prosecutor.
All three parts.
And on the main stage, you'll
need to defend your life
and convince the judges and the
world why you deserve
to be America's next drag
superstar.
- If there's something
in this competition
that I've been waiting for,
it's to express to these judges
why I should be America's next
drag superstar.
- To help you build an ironclad
case, you'll each have
one-on-one time with mega
attorney Gloria Allred.
- [gasps]
- [laughs]
- And if that wasn't enough,
you're having lunch
with RuPaul too.
- Oh, my god.
- [laughs]
So don't fuck it up.
- Hello, girls.
all: Hi.
- Last year, I had choreography,
but to step it up,
I thought I would add a little
chiffonography.
Today, we're going for a
seductive, goddess-y theme.
A lot of fans, a lot of hair, a
lot of chiffon in the fan.
I want you to be sexy, soft,
beautiful.
- Okay.
- Five, six, seven, eight.
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.
- [squeals]
- Alaska, you're getting
nervous, it seems like.
And think about not turning in.
'Cause that's kind of not the
choreography.
- I'm making a fool of myself
in front of Candis Cayne.
- All right, girls.
We're gonna do some hairography.
Bring me my fan.
[all gasp]
The basic point of fan use is
all about flicking your hair.
The fast and then the slow.
Very good.
- I am definitely the most sexy.
I know how to work some
motherfucking hair.
And, uh, I like being blown.
- Give me goddess.
Try not to let your hair
in your face.
Uh...
This is challenging
choreography.
Think more Beyonce and less
Cousin It.
But, you know,
this is the top three
and I really need them
to step up.
Whip it.
-<i> Bonjour.</i>
- It's time for us to shoot a
music video
for RuPaul's<i> The Beginning.</i>
Nice car.
- [laughs]
- The basic idea here is that
you're driving into the wild
blue yonder
and you're going to fly
to heaven.
[all laugh]
- Wow.
- Action. Whoa!
Whoa!
And left.
- Oh!
- Okay, we have a tragedy.
- Oh, she trying to pull the
patch!
- [yelps]
Dear god, do I really have
to be attached to her now too?
- Drive, drive, stop!
[horn beeps]
- Whoa!
- What?
[all laugh]
- Jinkx kind of took over,
going crazy and having fun.
- [laughs]
- And here she is.
It's Mama Ru.
Oh, my lord.
Alaska, shake your hair out.
- Alaska, did you not get
the concept of hairography?
Afro?
- Okay, we've sped this song up
1 1/2 times
so that when we slow it down,
the effect will be lip-syncing
perfectly to the song.
Let the chipmunkery begin.
Cue the music.
[song sped up]
[rapid, high-pitched singing]
- What?
- And now we have to sell the
lip-sync at double the speed?
I feel like I'm going insane.
- Cut.
Let the chiffon drift.
Give me mystery.
- Cut.
- Alaska's movement
is a little awkward.
She had trouble
with the chiffonography.
- Cut.
- Beautiful.
- Yeah! Spin!
- Roxxxy did great hair
movement.
- Give it a spin, Roxxxy!
- She had her lip-sync down
really good.
- Yay!
- Nice.
- Good job, Roxxxy.
- Amazing.
All right, ladies.
- Give me goddess.
Hit it!
Six, seven, eight.
And one, look,
three, four, five.
Cut.
I need you to be on, Alaska.
It's about precision, precision,
precision.
From the top.
Five, six, seven, eight.
One, two, three, four.
Pick it up, Alaska.
Cut.
- The other girls are doing
really good
and their hair is flowing
and their chiffon is flowing in
the right places, and I'm, like,
terrible and this is awful.
- What are your winning
qualities?
- Um...
- You need to believe
in yourself.
- For you to just discredit
all my work--
- I know, you're the victim.
- I have done well
in this competition
and I love what I do.
- Huh?
[laughter]
- Hi.
- Hi, Alaska.
- Gloria Allred is a mega lawyer
who is known for
taking on really high-profile
cases.
- Make yourself comfortable.
- Tomorrow, we are going to have
to present
our final arguments
as to why we should be
America's next drag superstar.
- Let's go right to what your
case is gonna be.
What are your winning qualities
that are unique to you?
- I have star quality.
The "X" factor.
- That's not good enough.
Give me specifics.
What is your most important
strength?
- Um...
- Just lay it on me.
- Well, I mean, I guess we can
see which one
you think is the most impactful.
- Okay, but you need to believe
in yourself.
Now, when you go out there
to make your argument,
you're gonna need to make it
with confidence.
Do you think you can do that?
- Hello, Mother.
- Hi, Jinkx.
How's tricks?
- Tricks are for kids.
I'm a lady.
- [laughs]
Listen, I hope you have
an appetite.
- Oh, yes.
This looks more than I can
handle.
- Now, Jinkx, what do you think
your life's gonna be like?
What--what do you want to do?
- It's been my life dream ever
since I started doing drag
to do drag on Broadway.
- I could see you
as Blanche DuBois.
- I could see that too.
- So what was it like for you
growing up?
I know that you had to sort of
grow up really fast.
- Mm-hmm.
- Tell me about that.
- I had no real mother in my
house when I was a teenager
because of her alcoholism.
There were times where me and my
brothers wouldn't have
gone to school that day if I
hadn't gotten us up.
- What effect has that had on
who you are as Jinkx Monsoon?
- This is my way of making peace
with a dark childhood
and make light of the disheveled
kind of crazy, kooky mom.
And then I adapted into my
mature drag queen
from yesteryear character.
- Right, so--and so you're
saving the Britney Spears
part of your career for later.
- It never even occurred to me
before my lunch with Ru
that maybe the reason I do drag
as an older character
is because I never really
connected with my childhood.
- I think you're
a really bright star
and I'm so happy you're here.
- Thank you.
I'm happy I'm here too.
- [laughs]
- And I'm not gonna eat these.
I'm gonna make a necklace
out of 'em.
- Oh, good.
[laughs]
- What are your unique strengths
that should persuade the judges
and everyone else
to vote for you?
- My unique strengths are that I
have shown you
that time after time,
when presented challenges,
that I could succeed even when I
didn't believe I could.
And I learned that not being
perfect is being perfect.
- Okay, let's stop right now.
What you don't want is you don't
want kind of pageant babble.
- Okay.
- As the kids would say,
keep it real.
You think you can do that?
- Yeah.
- All right.
What are some of the obstacles
that you have faced
and how have you overcome those
obstacles?
- Actually before coming
to this competition,
I wanted to quit doing drag.
I was done.
I was done with the criticism
from the audience.
I was done with nobody
wanting to date me
because I'm a drag queen.
- Okay, but how did you
overcome it?
- Woman, can I speak?
- Remember, I want to...
- Yeah. I--well--
- Get the negative
into the positive.
- I overcame it by realizing
that God has given me a gift.
And I consider myself
a chameleon.
'Cause when the lights, camera,
action, that curtain opens
and you don't know
what's coming out,
that's the excitement of going
to a drag show.
- What would you say are some
of the weaknesses
of your competitors, Roxxxy?
- Jinkx needs to stop being
such a one-shtick kind of girl.
Alaska, in the kids' show,
came out as a boy.
This is a drag competition.
Where's the beauty?
Where's the creativity?
It pisses me off.
- You're showing passion,
so that's all good.
But how can you say this without
being too, kind of, catty?
- Hello, Alaska.
- Hi.
- [laughs]
Now, if you win,
what would it be like
to be part of drag's first
royal couple?
- Wow, I would feel just like
Kate Middleton.
I would rule the drag world
with dignity and grace
and lots of lace front wigs.
- [laughs]
Tell me something I don't know
about you.
What are you afraid of?
- I have a fear of dying.
- Why?
- Because I f--I've worked--
I've worked so hard to get so
many things in my life
that I'm so happy to have.
And I guess it's just a fear of,
like, losing that.
Like, my relationship
with Sharon.
It's like a castle that we built
and I don't want it to--
to go away by me dying,
you know?
It's a crazy love that Sharon
and I have
and it's something that I never
expected to happen.
She's my soul mate.
And I don't know that I've ever
had that before.
- Don't be afraid of that.
Just practice living
in this moment.
Think about how sweet it is
right now.
I am so proud of you.
Good luck, sweetheart.
- Thank you.
- What do you think
are your strengths
that are superior to your
competitors'?
- I'm a captivating performer
onstage
and I think comedy and the
ability to make people laugh
is such a huge and important
part of drag.
- But what about your
competitors?
I noticed you kind of shied away
from that.
- The thing that pushes me out
of my comfort zone the most
is when I have to talk poorly
about my other competitors
because I have a huge respect
for every drag queen.
- You sound like a person who
wants to be positive,
but in this competition...
- Yeah.
- You're gonna need to elevate
yourself up...
- Mm-hmm.
- And move them down.
- Well, hey, Roxxxy.
- Hi, Ru.
- You've done really well with
meeting the challenge head on
with this fearless attitude.
Have you always been that way?
- I've always been a competitor.
That's what drove me
to pageants.
- What do you want people to
take away from your experience?
- I came in here wanting to
represent for the big girls,
and, you know, a big girl has
made the top three.
And I think it's time to crown
a thick and juicy kind of girl.
Being a gay man
and being thicker,
it's harder, but I love it.
I'm representing
for the big girls.
I can't wait to make them all
proud of me and, you know,
let them know that,
hey, love yourself.
- You're an amazing queen.
- Thank you.
- You are an amazing queen.
- Oh, my god.
- Thanks, Roxxxy.
- Thank you, Ru, so much.
This isn't a joke to me.
I've had it.
I've fucking had it.
I'm ready to plead my case
on this runway.
[laughter]
- We're right about to do our
courtroom scene,
directed by Mathu Andersen,
in which we all
have to play three distinctly
different characters:
the witness, the defense
attorney, and the prosecutor.
- Ladies, you've been instructed
to create
different characters
for each role.
So blow me away.
Here we go. Action.
- All rise for the honorable
Judge Rudy.
- Order in the courtroom,
hunties.
- Judge Rudy,
the evidence will prove
that the accused is one
cold-blooded biatch.
- As the defense attorney, I
would like to submit my briefs.
- Cut.
Alaska, I 'd like to know what
your inspiration
and motivation for your
character at the moment.
- Her name is Peg Hollis.
She smokes two packs of Misty
Slim Menthol 100s
and she's a hard-ass.
She's going on 60.
40 years in the business.
Graduated law school at 20.
I don't know how that happened.
[all laugh]
- It's a miscarriage of justice.
[laughs]
- "I smoke 80 packs of Virginia
Slims every day."
I'm sorry, that's not funny
to me.
- Okay, and action.
- Those hideous, uh, drag queens
had it coming.
It was a murd--mercy murder.
- Cut.
- Sorry, I messed that up.
- Taking a deep breath,
and... action.
- If I'm guilty of being
anything up in "herrre,"
it's of being fierce.
- And cut. Roxxxy?
- Uh-huh?
- Who are you?
- I'm Roxxxy Andrews.
A ghetto bitch.
- Roxxxy's character of Roxxxy
is definitely Tamar Braxton.
- Where my people at?
Where my people at?
- Dot-com.
- Okay, ladies.
It's time to do musical chairs
and change into your next
character.
Hit the changing rooms.
So here we go.
Action.
- Judge Rudy, the prosecution
would like to submit
the murder weapon.
- Objection!
Reading the witness.
- You want answers?
- We want the "T," stupid.
- You can't handle the "T."
- Jinkx was the most solid
in her characterizations.
She has the leading edge
in this courtroom drama.
And cut.
Big change.
Next role.
Okay, ladies.
I see you're all in different
positions and ready to go...
on action!
- Those damn fucking drag queens
had it coming.
- I say, I say--
- Cut, cut, cut, cut.
One moment.
Just gonna back up a little bit
because, um...
- I said a bad word.
- You said naughty words.
Action.
- Those hideous drag queens
had it coming.
- Judge Rudy,
the evidence will prove
that the accused is one cold,
hard-blooded bitch.
Biatch.
- Cut.
Roxxxy, what's the motivation
for your character?
- Uh, actually just a bitch.
- Okay.
Jinkx Monsoon?
- Her name is Daisy A. Irwin
and she's a little older than
she tries to pass herself off as
and she's just a simple
Southern lawyer.
- Fantastic. Alaska?
- I hope I don't go to prison,
but if I do,
I hope it's a men's prison.
- [laughs]
Okay, really bring it.
I want to see Satan,
ancient crone, and...bitch.
Action!
- I say, I say, objection.
- And Alaska?
- What's the line?
- "I can't face it."
- I can't face it.
I can't face it.
[sobs]
- What is it you can't face?
- What did you just call her?
- Roxxxy, humor me.
Your spit take
was a bit overly long.
Try and get the water
out of your mouth
so you can get to your line.
- Okay.
What did you just call her?
- Spit takes are usually a bit
more, "Puh!"
Nnn!
- Am I still not doing it right?
- Tight.
It seemed a little bit
problematic for Roxxxy
with the old spit take.
I just need you to snort it out
like a, "Puh!"
"What did you say?"
- I didn't know you wanted me
to say the line.
- You can tell it's really
affecting her
when Mathu calls her out.
The frustration
has gotten to the point
where you can tell she's mad.
- Ladies, guess what.
That's a wrap.
- Whew.
- [groans]
- This isn't even my character
anymore.
I just literally
have the shakes.
This day has been so long.
- [laughs]
My brain is completely gone.
- Melted.
- Are you okay, Roxxxy?
- I'm perfectly fine.
- No, you're not. You're upset.
- You guys are comedy girls,
so your spit takes were fine.
Didn't know a courtroom scene
was comedic.
- Girl.
It's a courtroom scene
that's written to be funny.
This is not<i> NCIS.</i>
- I take what I do extremely
professional and real
and I don't make a joke
out of everything.
And they're gonna read me 'cause
I'm lost
because there's
so much bullshit going on.
So trying to sell comedy,
trying to sell comedy,
trying to outdo each other--
I know what I've done
and I've--
I-I'm ready to plead my case
on this runway.
I'm sick of the gimmicks.
I feel that America's next
drag superstar
should take her career a little
more serious
than completely joking
all the fucking time.
I'm so--I've had it.
I've fucking had it.
This isn't a joke to me.
- I don't think you--
- This competition
is extremely serious
and it's the rest of my life.
Girl, I'm over it.
Why do I have to make up a name
to who I'm doing?
I'm acting like an attorney.
A bitch.
Why do I have to have some kind
of fucking character?
"Well, I'm so and so.
And I do this
and I'm 80 years old."
No, you're not 80 years old.
You're Jinkx Monsoon
playing a character.
- Roxxxy has admitted
to me before
that she's lashed out at me
when she's felt insecure
with her performance.
And she's obviously
doing it again.
- I'm just frustrated with this
whole fucking competition.
- I'm sorry if you missed the
mark on this challenge,
but stop trying to blame
everyone else
when you don't do well.
- The time has come for you
to defend your life.
[laughter]
- Ah!
- It's the last time we're gonna
see this place.
It's the final day.
And I just want to soak up this
experience
for everything it's worth.
- How did you guys feel
about yesterday?
- Yeah. Um--
- You know--
- I know I had a breakdown,
but the buffoonery that was
going on in that room?
All of our characters
are not supposed to be funny.
- Yes, they are.
- I think they were.
- No, they're not.
- I love how you say, "comedy,"
like it's a bad thing.
- Well, honey,
not all drag is comedy.
- I take comedy very seriously.
Comedy is not poking fun
at drag.
Like, comedy's--
- Well, it's not funny to me.
And the fact that drag continues
to get insulted
in this competition
is not funny to me.
They're making fun of drag.
I take my drag very seriously
and I look good
from head to toe.
Not in the same shoes
since day one.
Not in the same wig
since day one.
Sorry, I change it up.
- So what has been
your favorite moment
throughout this competition?
- Seeing you in the bottom two.
- I just don't get
what's so rewarding
about being hurtful like that.
- I'm not being hurtful.
I'm being truthful.
You asked me.
I gave you an answer.
You skated through this whole
competition.
- For you to just discredit
all my work,
it just shows how immature
and bitter you are.
- I can't hear you.
I'm blow-drying my hair.
- I would never discredit
your form of drag.
- Huh?
- It doesn't make me feel good
to talk to other people the way
you talk to me sometimes.
- I know, you're the victim.
Everybody hates you and nobody
gets you and--
- I'm not a victim.
I've been very strong throughout
this competition.
- Roxxxy's a pageant girl,
and those pageant girls
play some wicked mind games
backstage.
- I know it's gonna get under
her skin.
I want her going in tonight
bothered.
Jinkx is competition to me and
I'm gonna do anything to get her
off her track.
- Victims blame other people
when they don't do well.
- You're getting all angry and--
- I have done well
in this competition
and I love what I do,
so I am not angry.
- This was the gas that I needed
for tonight.
I'm ready to tell the judges why
these two jokes should go home.
They have no idea what's coming
to this runway.
I'm here to win America's next
drag superstar,
and I'm going for blood.
- Alaska, what's been your
favorite part
of this competition?
- Seeing you in the bottom two.
[laughs]
- [laughter]
Welcome to the main stage
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
Hey, judges.
Tonight, it's just family.
Michelle Visage,
can I get a witness?
- Of course.
You got one right here.
- Santino Rice, any objections?
- Just one, Ru.
You are looking too damn fine
tonight.
- Oh.
- [laughs]
- Objection!
Ass-kissing overruled.
- For their final challenge,
our queens starred
in the official music video
for my latest single,<i> </i>
<i>The Beginning.</i>
And tonight, they're ready
to hit the runway
in their very best drag
as they prepare
to defend their lives.
Are you ready for some justice
to be served?
- Bring it.
- Ready.
- Gentlemen, start your engines
and may the best woman win.
- First up, the queen
on everybody's lips,
Roxxxy Andrews.
- Ooh!
- Glamour.
- This is my last time walking
this runway
and I'm feeling
so good right now.
The dress is stone
from head to toe.
I'm giving them a little bit
of my hair.
I'm feeling absolutely
glamorous.
- Foxy Roxxxy.
- She must have just come
from Paisley Park.
- Where my Paisley at?
- [laughs]
- Next up, Jinkx Monsoon.
- Aww.
- Fairy tale come to life.
- Very<i> Princess Bride.</i>
- It is.
- I am exuding beauty
from within.
I want them to see how gorgeous
and proud I feel.
- Like, it's soft, earthy Jinkx.
- She's a real
Renaissance woman.
- What kind of sauce
is Renee sauce?
- Ooh, it's good
on some chicken.
- Mmm.
- Up next, 49th state, Alaska.
High fash-i-on.
- That's what she's giving you.
- Yes, she's giving some fear up
in here.
- I'm coming down the runway
and I'm looking like a high
fashion ghoul
and I feel lovely.
- Oh, she got some booty today.
- Oh, yeah.
That's what she got
from her mama.
She's wearing
a lace front dress.
[all laugh]
Welcome, ladies.
The judges' final critique
is now in session.
Let's take a look
at the evidence.
- As the defense attorney, I 'd
like to submit my briefs.
- The state accuses Roxxxy
Andrews
of deplorable acts
of slayin' bitches.
- I plead guilty of being
devastatingly beautiful.
- Those hideous drag queens
had it coming.
It was a mercy killing.
- The evidence
will prove beyond a doubt
that the accused is one
cold-blooded biatch.
- Objection!
Reading the witness!
- The prosecution would like
to submit the murder weapon.
A size three stiletto.
- But I wear a size 14.
- If the pup don't fit,
you must acquit.
- [laughs]
Now it's time
for the judges' critiques.
[laughter]
Ladies, it's time
for the judges' critiques.
First up, Roxxxy Andrews.
- Tonight, you look fantastic.
And what's been really exciting,
Roxxxy,
is seeing you come in
as a pageant queen
and you leave as a fully
rounded--pardon the pun--queen.
- In that video,
you exuded sex appeal.
Your hairography was on point.
Then in the courtroom scene,
there was a point where
some of the characters started
to blend a little bit for me.
- Next up, Jinkx Monsoon.
- You gave so many different,
varied performances.
Tyler Perry better watch out.
- I think her head piece tonight
is adorable,
but the dress
is just not my favorite.
It's very prom-ish. Very '80s.
- But your face looks amazing.
And you moved like you feel
beautiful tonight.
- All right, next up, Alaska.
Hi-eee!
- Hi-eee!
- Tonight, I really loved this
look on you.
The courtroom, your characters
were realized,
thought out, and you may not
be the strongest dancer,
but I think you made it work.
I don't know if I would have
chosen an afro.
- You had a lot to live up to.
And I think now you're--you're
not in anyone's shadow.
You're standing as Alaska.
You're your own queen.
- You've made so many of my
dreams come true being here.
It means everything to me.
Thank you.
- Thank you.
Ladies, now we are ready
for your closing arguments.
Convince me
and everyone watching
why you deserve to be America's
next drag superstar.
The time has come for you
to defend your life.
First up, Roxxxy Andrews.
- The reason I should be
America's next drag superstar?
What they don't have, I do have.
I have grace, I have beauty,
I have professionalism.
I want to be a person that kids
look up to.
I am a thick and juicy girl,
and that makes me so proud.
I could never let you down.
And I will be one hell
of a superstar.
- Thank you, Roxxxy.
Jinkx Monsoon.
- Growing up, I was continually
an outcast,
and in my teen years,
I discovered drag.
So even though I was hurting
at home, I was living onstage.
My whole life, I've danced
to the beat of a different drum.
And when I came here, I took
the critiques and I was able to
adapt and grow while still being
true to who I am as a performer.
And anything else was just water
off a duck's back.
- [laughs]
- Thank you, Jinkx.
- Um, can I say something else?
- What's on your mind?
- I said something to Jinkx
earlier today that I just--
it has nothing
to do with the runway,
but I want to apologize to her.
I really didn't mean that,
and I really do love you.
I love you.
- Thank you, Roxxxy.
Last, but not least, Alaska.
- When it comes
to pleading our case,
Roxxxy and Jinkx totally
copped out.
We're supposed to say
why the other queens
shouldn't be America's
next drag superstar.
My name is Alaska,
and I am hungry
to be America's next drag
superstar.
Not hungry.
I'm practically starving.
As for my fellow competitors
tonight, Roxxxy was faced
with a challenge of presenting
a 16-year-old girl.
What did she present?
A tawdry, 27-year-old tramp.
And Jinkx Monsoon.
During the Sugar Ball,
she failed not just one,
not just two, but three
different looks.
I am the queen who takes the
tragic and turns it into magic.
I take trash and turn it into
treasure.
And having never fallen
into the bottom two,
I am Alaska and I am America's
next drag superstar!
Thank you.
- Wow.
Thank you, Alaska.
And thank you, ladies.
While you enjoy an Absolut
cocktail in the Interior
Illusions Lounge, the judges
and I will deliberate.
You may leave the stage.
All right, now, just between us
girls, what do you think?
Let's start with Roxxxy Andrews.
- Roxxxy is the embodiment
of a superstar.
In the music video, she whipped
that hair.
- She a video ho.
- She's thick and juicy.
She--she owns it
and she's come up
with some pretty amazing looks
this season.
- She comes from the pageant
world of drag.
To go from that
to this competition,
she's a fully-rounded
entertainer.
Jinkx Monsoon.
- Unlike Roxxxy, Jinkx does not
care at all what she looks like
and will go completely
into a character.
- She's in love with her craft.
And you see it
in everything she does,
but her style is--is lacking.
- But if we saw Carol Burnett
out at a red carpet event
and she looked a hot mess,
are you even gonna care?
- She talked about dancing to
the beat of a different drummer
and that's something each of us
on this panel right now
can relate to.
Miss Alaska.
- The cards were stacked
against her.
I love that she's persevered
through that.
- Alaska's got a really great,
sick, twisted sense of humor.
I like that she was able
to drop down that wall.
Mr. Gorbachev,
knock down that wall.
- [laughs]
- And when she gave us more
vulnerability,
I loved her even more.
Her defend-your-life speech
was the best.
- Well, they worked
with Gloria Allred.
- But she was the only one
out of the three
that read the other two.
- Yeah.
- It was actually part
of the assignment.
- Yes.
- Alaska has evolved
understanding the power,
not only of drag,
but the power of Alaska.
They're all so different.
Let's just break it down.
This week, Roxxxy really rocked
the music video,
Jinkx excelled
at the courtroom scene,
and when it came
to defending her life,
Alaska had the upper hand.
Damn, this is a photo finish.
- Hell, yeah.
- Silence!
Bring back my girls.
[laughter]
Welcome back, ladies.
Only one of you will be named
America's next drag superstar
and walk away with a prize
package that includes a crown
designed by Fierce Drag Jewels
and a cash prize...
of $100,000.
Now, based on your performance
in this week's final challenge
and throughout the season,
each of you
has earned the right
to lip-sync for your life.
- I have never lip-synced
for my life before, and now
I have to lip-sync against two
other queens for $100,000.
Help me, Mommy.
- Three amazing queens
stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me
and prove to the world
that you are America's
next drag superstar.
- This is the last chance
to show ourselves to Ru,
the judges, and the whole world.
- I'm so ready for this.
I'm ready to dance,
I'm ready to show them
why I should be America's
next drag superstar.
It's what I'm here for.
- Good luck.
And don't fuck it up.
- Jinkx Monsoon represents
the awkward kids of the world.
Being America's next drag
superstar
means everything to me.
- I just want to win this so bad
and it's what I love to do.
It's my passion, it's my art.
I am America's next drag
superstar.
- I am a queen who takes trash
and I turn it into treasure.
You have to take whatever you
have and make the most of it.
This is the beginning
of the rest of my life.
This is it.
- [laughs]
- Get it, girls.
- Wow. [laughs]
Ladies...
I have not made my final
decision.
The race is that close.
And like last year, the crown
could still go
to any one of you.
Now I need the help of<i> Drag Race</i>
fans everywhere.
Based on all the evidence,
who do you think
should be America's next
drag superstar?
Is it Alaska?
Jinkx Monsoon?
Or Roxxxy Andrews?
Tweet your top choice

<i>Countdown to the Crown.</i>
Alaska, Jinkx Monsoon,
Roxxxy Andrews.
With one week remaining, this
season
is the closest contest
in<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> history.</i>
Even I can't quite put my finger
on the charisma, uniqueness,
nerve, and talent
it will take to win the title
of America's
Next Drag Superstar.
That's why I want to hear
from you.
Which queen deserves to win,
and why?

To win the crown,
your favorite queen
needs all the help you can give,
tonight and all week long.
Now speaking of favorites,
I want to check in with
my countdown correspondents,
Latrice Royale, Willam,
and Sharon Needles.
Welcome, ladies.
- Hi-yee!
- Hey, Ru.
- Can you help me make sense
of this crazy season?
- Ru, the suspense is killing
me, and not in a good way.
My marriage is at stake.
- Boo-hoo. I'm mad.
Season five was all about
performing,
and I could have tore it up,
like an episiotomy.
- Ooh, Ru, I'm living
for these season five girls.
Honey, you've got some funny
characters on this season.
Bitch, I live!
- Well, thank you, ladies.
I'll be checking back with you
in just a minute.
Now, to truly understand
how Alaska, Jinkx, and Roxxxy
ascended to the top three,
we need to do an instant RuPlay
of the bad-ass bitches they beat
down in their battle to become
America's Next Drag Superstar.
Game on.
- Hello, boys.
- Week one, Cincinnati cougar
Penny Tration hit the field
with a seasoned swagger.
Thousands of fans voted to get
her here,
but it took just one devastating
block by rookie
Serena Chacha to send
her packing.
all: Hi!
- College draft pick Serena
Chacha arrived a young pup,
eager to run with the big dogs.
- I have a feeling you just
like to be the only pretty one.
- I just think you're annoying.
- But on her second outing,
a flag on the play...
- Doo-de-doo-de-doo.
- Signaled that Serena was a
little out of her league,
and she cha-cha'd her way out
of the game.
- To the other queens,
pick up a book and go read.
- Hello, girls.
- Big-hearted Banji girl
Monica Beverly Hillz...
- With a "Z."
- Was a prospect with promise.
- Monica Beverly Hillz
is very good at giving face.
- While she didn't always bring
her "A" game...
- Can't you see I'm trying to
get some sunlight--
[stammers]
-<i> Cut!</i>
She bravely shared her "T"
with the rest of the world.
And when she lip-synched
for her life against Coco,
Monica Beverly Hillz
was sent back to
the 9-0-2-1-oh, no,
she better don't.
- Hey, sisters.
- San Francisco treat
Honey Mahogany
brought her own mystique
to the challenges.
- Bitch, I am from Chicago!
- But in her dance debut,
her kicks were incomplete.
- You know, I've never done
Diana before.
- Clearly.
- Hey, y'all.
- Week after week, catch
of the day Vivienne Pinay
felt stiff-armed
by the competition.
- Great.
A bunch of loudmouths.
- But her dance in the end zone
failed to put her
on the scoreboard.
A lackluster lip sync came down
to a coin toss,
and both Honey and Vivienne
hit the showers
in<i> Drag Race's</i><span style="bodyStyle"> first</i>
double elimination.
- Oh!
- Oh, word!
- Now, if pretty scored you
extra points,
Lineysha Sparx would have been
an all-star.
Her Tyra-nese performance got
her named MVP.
But sadly, Lineysha's snatch
game was over before it began...
- French fries.
- Leaving Detox to bench
this beauty for good.
- Hey, girls, hey!
- Jade Jolie arrived all
sparkles, rainbows,
and sunshine.
Her laugh was her best defense.
- [laughing]
- But still this queen could
dominate the offense whenever
shade was in play.
- Some people shouldn't come
down and wear a two-piece
because the view
that I had was not too cute.
- But instead of finding
her voice...
- She found herself lip-synching
against Coco,
and in the end, sashayed away.
- Uh-oh.
- Hey, ladies! Aah!
- Oh!
- Ivy Winters turned out to be
a triple threat.
She could sew, she could sing,
and she gave great face.
Although sometimes it seemed her
presentation
was a little stilted.
Wah!
Sadly, a fumble in the fragrance
challenge...
- New York City.
- Uh, that's Tokyo.
- Kept this queen from making
the final playoffs.
Texas Tornado Alyssa Edwards
hit the field,
ready to play hard
and settle old scores.
- Game on, bitch.
The sequel.
- She gave game face
for the ages.
- [smacks lips]
- And her countless
Alyssa-isms...
- I don't get cute.
I get drop-dead gorgeous.
- Gave inspiration...
-<i> Back rolls!</i>
- To the nation.
-<i> Why you being cute?</i>
- On the main stage,
this dancing diva
had all the right moves.
But by the telenovella...
- I have the same disease!
- Her pageant prance
was played out.
- What?
- And she was sent home
by her archrival...
Coco Montrese.
- The diva has arrived!
- A Vegas veteran who was
always ready to rumble...
- Don't try it, little boy.
- Or lip-synch the house down.
Ever the underdog, Coco scored
a big win at the roast...
- Pants so high, he look like
he in New Orleans at
Hurricane Katrina, girl.
[laughter]
- But dropped the ball
in the army-navy makeover,
forcing this beauty queen
to take her final bow.
Feeling overwhelmed?
You need to Detox.
This silicone cyclone put in
major work before suiting up
for<i> Drag Race.</i>
- I've had my hips
and my ass done.
I've had my pecs done.
Underneath my eyes done.
My six-pack done.
- And once here,
she had a few surprises
to pull out of her b-b-b-box!
- [clucking] Hi, kids!
- A runway rock star, Detox
never let us see her sweat...
all: Oh!
- Prompting some to accuse her
of coasting toward the end zone.
Ultimately this final four
standout
hit a sugar wall
in the sugar ball.
And after losing her lip sync
to Jinkx,
parting was bittersweet.
- I've had it. Bye.
- Well, there you have it,
skorts fans.
This season's rocky road
to the top three.
Damn!
I need a protein shake.
Coming up...
- The shade of it all.
-<i> With Latrice, Willam,</i>
<i>and Sharon Needles.</i>
<i>Plus never-before-seen</i>
<i>too-hot-for-Drag-Race outtakes.</i>
- Come here and sit on my face,
bitch.
- And for the first time
anywhere,
we reveal<i> Untucked:</i>
<i>The Lost Episode.</i>
- No one's hiding any knives or
shivs on their dresses,
are they?
- Keep tweeting who you want to
be crowned America's Next
Drag Superstar,
as<i> RuPaul's Drag Race: Countdown</i>
<i>to the Crown</i><span style="bodyStyle"> continues.</i>
[laughing]
[laughing]
Welcome back to<i> RuPaul's Drag</i>
<i>Race: Countdown to the Crown.</i>
This has been the stormiest
season on record.
- I could give a fuck.
- One thing's for sure,
the forecast always included
a 100% chance of...
- Shade.
- Early in the season,
super storm Coco collided
with hurricane Alyssa
and let us have it.
- I don't think she wants
to talk about it.
But we're gonna talk about it...
if she doesn't go home first.
- Shade.
- Just pearls hanging off
her boobs, baby.
- Very you.
- Shade.
She's won several pageants,
and unlike Savannah, she's
completed all of her reigns.
- Shade.
And then the tears come out.
And the Academy Award goes to...
- Shade.
You need to be worried about
what's going over there with
that same makeup
every single time.
- Look how orange you
fucking look, girl!
- Girls, you're both pretty.
both: Shade.
- Now is it just me, or are you
over this pageant feud mess?
Officially.
Ain't nobody got time for that.
Now I got some extra yummy,
never-before-seen leftovers
from the RuPaul roast.
- Michelle, your nails are
so long,
how the fuck do you wipe
your ass?
- Oh-ho!
- But better yet, how do you
wipe Ru's before you kiss it?
[laughter]
- Let me tell y'all about
Santino.
All the hems on his clothes
be crooked.
You know why?
'Cause he's always looking
at you like this.
[laughter]
- Knock, knock.
all: Who's there?
- Ivy Winters.
all: Ivy Winters who?
- Exactly.
[laughter]
- RuPaul, you don't need
a roast, mama.
By the looks of your face,
it's been roasting
for quite some time.
[laughter]
- Ru, you're always saying,
"You're born naked,
and the rest is drag."
but in your case,
you were born naked,
and the rest was just fucking
terrible.
[laughter]
- Now, joining us live from
the<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> Weather Center,</i>
mother meteorologist
Latrice Royale.
Hi.
- Hi. I got news for you.
- Ooh, child.
Now what do you think of all the
romper room fuckery this season?
- Ru, I have one thing to say.
The shade.
The shade of it all.
- [laughs]
Now, Latrice, does the
competition bring out the worst
in some queens?
Or are they just shady ladies?
- RuPaul, in my experience,
the camera don't lie,
and neither do I.
Oh, and, girls, stop blaming
the editing, okay?
- Bible.
Bible, girl, uh-huh.
Tell it. Tell it!
- But you know what I love
about<i> Drag Race?</i>
Just when you think everything
has gone dark,
out comes a rainbow
of truth and light!
Hallelujah.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Let's take a look at some of
the most heartwarming moments
this season.
- Hey, Alyssa, this is Dad.
- Oh!
- I just want you to know...
- [cries]
- [cries] I'm proud of you.
And now I'm not ashamed
to tell people my son's gay.
- Oh! Oh, my God.
[crying]
- Forgiveness is free, baby.
Give all you can.
- I've just been holding
a secret in,
and I've been trying so hard
and--
- What secret?
- I'm not just a drag queen.
I'm a transgendered woman.
Every day is hard.
- I invited you here
because you were fierce.
The only person
who does not believe is you.
Stay strong,
Monica Beverly Hillz.
- I will.
- God makes no mistakes.
You be you, child.
- I continually regret and,
like, second-guess the fact that
I left my youngest brother
with a woman who wasn't ready
to be a mom.
When I'm, like, doing shit like
this, I feel so selfish...
- Don't, Jinkx, don't.
- [cries] To have left
my youngest brother.
- Don't.
Not at all.
- It feels like--right now,
like I've abandoned him.
- You haven't.
- Patience and love, honey.
Patience and love.
- My mother left my sister
and myself
at a bus stop
when I was three.
[cries] I try to stay so strong,
but I'm so weak
at the same time.
[crying]
It just hurts that I was left.
Nobody cared.
- You know, we as gay people,
we get to choose our family,
you know?
We get to choose the people
that we're around.
I am your family.
We are a family here.
- Bless us all.
Bless us all.
This is large and in charge,
chunky, yet funky,
Latrice Royale.
Back to you, Ru.
- Thank you, my queen.
- Aah!
[beep]
- Tonight, we're getting up
close and personal
with each
of our top three queens,
starting in alphabetical order
with the 49th state, Alaska.
Wiggling in from Pittsburgh,
Alaska arrived as a dark horse.
She auditioned for every season,
only to watch her girlfriend
snatch the crown last year.
But when this bowlegged beauty
arrived, she had me at "Hi-yee!"
- Hi-yee!
- Hi-yee!
- Hi-yee!
Hi-yee.
Hi-yee.
- Hi-yee.
- She tanked her first challenge
and quickly joined forces
with Rolaskatox.
But after some tough love...
- No!
- Alaska declared a state
of independence.
- Alaska.
- Until last week, she was the
only queen never to lip-synch
for her life.
And, girl, when it comes
to making us laugh,
Alaska has always been
right on the money.
- [whispering]
Your makeup is terrible.
- From the fragrance challenge
to the sugar ball,
she delivered one
of the strongest finishes
in<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> history.</i>
And her triumphant testimony
on the main stage last week
showed us why Alaska could be
America's Next Drag Superstar.
So if you believe in Alaska,
let me feel it.

celebrities are just like us.

The legendary Sally Jessy
Raphael lives for Jinkx Monsoon.
- Jinkx Monsoon, you're special.
Shout-out to you.

Her favorite new expression...
- All "T," all shade.
- And, Mariah,
what you got, girl?
Now this next queen is so viral,
she's sickening.
Hi, Willam.
- Thanks, Ru.
Hey, superfans, you tweeted us
questions, and I got answers.
[beeping]
@johnbrunskill--
that's a lot of name.
"If you had to pick,
which season five gal
would you kai kai with?"
Coco, she's black.
@mcbrewster,
"You're a friend of Detox."
@fozziebare, "Don't you agree
that we need #LessFishMoreFun?"
No.
If you want ugly,
turn on Discovery Network.
Good-bye.

Oh, I've had that too.

double elimination or yours?"
Mine.
They didn't even throw up.
Fucking amateurs.
@RuPaul, "Love you baby,
but your time is up.
Thanks, gi--"
Oh, I gotta go.
- Thanks, Willam.
And for the record, opinions
expressed by Willam
do not reflect that
of RuPaul Inc.,
Logo TV, President Obama,
or Tuckahoe State Prison
for ladies.
- [hums]
- Now, our superfans don't just
watch the show,
they do recaps and become stars
in their own right.
I love them all.
But these are some
of my favorites.
Can I get a RuCap up in here?
- Hi-yee.
- Hi-yee.
- That was best episode ever!
- Whoever is making up these
mini-challenges, bitch,
they need an Emmy.
Did you see--whew!
- My favorite walk
of this runway was Alyssa.
- [laughs]
both: Alyssa Edwards.
- She ain't gonna win.
- With that fucking
faux dog-rat thing.
- [laughs]
- That is if she don't go home
first.
- Like, I wanted, like,
5, 6, 7, 24, 52.
- Jade is a string of pearls
away from becoming a showgirl!
- I am serving you fish, honey.
Fish on a platter.
[laughs]
- It was the best mini-challenge
of any reality TV show,
past, present, and motherfucking
future, bitches.
- Some of the biggest
<i>Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> fans</i>
are our extra special
guest judges.
Hold onto your wigs for
celebrity guest stars exposed.
- Do you tuck the balls, too,
or just--
- You gotta tuck them balls,
girl?
- Yes.
- How do you tuck the balls?
- Well--
- Actually, I give a detailed
description in my book,
<i>Workin' It!,</i>
which is available on Amazon.
- You can definitely tell
Alaska has two feet,
but we embrace the two feet,
and we're trying to help her--
- The left--
Everyone has two feet.
Two left feet.
- Sorry, two left feet.
- This one.
Sharp as a knife.
- Anita, I think Coco's
in trouble.
- I think so too.
[laughs] If she had done what
Santiago had suggested--
- Or Santino.
- Or Santino.
- Oh, Santino, I'm sorry!
- Or Santino!
- And from the Fashion Police,
George Kotsiopoulos.
What are you gonna do,
arrest me for smoking?
'Cause my pussy's on fire.
[both laugh]
- It's "bro-cod," black
and with this gold,
horrible "bro-cod,"
but it's, like--
- Are you trying to say brocade?
- No, I say "bro-cod."
- It's brocade.
- Uh, in France, it's "bro-cod."
- It's fucking brocade.
- I don't care where the fuck
you went to school--
- It's brocade.
- Swear to God.
- They so crazy!
But nobody get it twisted
like my girls.
I try to raise them right,
but what you gonna do?
- Whoa!
- [laughs]
- I won the challenge!
- Oh, my God.
Not by my bag!
Not by my bag, not by my bag!
- Aah!
- Some of these girls
are cock-hungry dick pigs.
- I want to see Lineysha naked.
- Trade! Trade!
Come here and sit on my face,
bitch!
- They said, "What do you like
the best about the werk room?"
I said, "There's a lot
of naked men."
- Trade!
- Would they have to blur this?
- I made this for you.
- [laughs] That's wonderful!
- Do you see
what's happening there?
- Gay sex in the service!
- It's time to play America's
new favorite game,
"Cut or Uncut."
[laughter]
Blue! Not a match.
- I sucked.
- Oh, not a match.
- Well, I didn't suck.
I wanted to, but--
Sorry, Mr. Cameraman.
- She bring it
to you every ball.
Why y'all gagging so?
Did you understand that?
If not, you could use
a refresher course
in drag linguistics.
#ShitMyGirlsSay.
- Can you say "not on tonight,"
Miss Roxxxy?
- Not tonight.
- No.
"Not on tonight."
- That makes no sense, girl.
- "Mama, they ain't gonna be
able to read me.
Not on tonight."
Not on tonight.
Not on
tonight.
Not on tonight.
- I've had it.
I have had it.
I've had it, officially!
- Detox, I'ma need you to stop
playing with my outfit.
- Well, I'm gonna need you
to stop relying on your body.
[laughter]
- Whoo!
- Stop relying on that body.
- Stop relying
on that body.
- Stop relying on that body.
- Stop relying
on that body.
- Stop relying
on Sharon Needles.
- The time has come for our
next up close
and personal profile.
Top three queen, the sleeper
from Seattle--Jinkx Monsoon.
- Ow!
[laughter]
- At 14, Jinkx's drag career
started with a wig
her grandmother gave her.
- And I've had it ever since.
- She brought her show biz
skills to RuPaulywood.
- From the very start, Jinkx
kept getting the same criticism.
- It's rather pedestrian.
- But before you could say...
- Water off a duck's back.
Water off
a duck's back.
- Jinkx became a real contender.
[gasps]
- I love it!
- Ah!
- And her breakout performance
as Little Edie got everybody
talking.
- This is the revolutionary
costume for the day.
- From Snatch Game on,
Jinkx gained momentum.
-<i> Si, si, si!</i>
- But she nearly crashed
at the sugar ball.
At last week's courtroom,
she brought the drama, mama.
- You can't handle the "T"!
- And as one of the most
talented comedy queens ever,
Jinkx has stolen our hearts.
But can she mop the title
of America's Next Drag
Superstar?
What do you think?
Is it monsoon season?
Let us know.

brought to you by peanut butter.
Peanut butter by RuPaul.
Must be jelly,
'cause jam don't shake.
Now, to find out what it means
to be the champion,
I've invited back our reigning
queen Sharon Needles.
- [laughing] Hi, Ru.
How are you?
- Now, everyone wants to know.
Who do you want to win?
- That's an obvious answer.
Lil' Pound Cake.
[both laughing]
- So if Alaska wins, can two
queens live happily ever after?
- Yeah, she spent a year
blowing my prize money.
So I would love to just get
a little bit of that back.
- Now, I wanna ask you
about winning,
and how has it changed
your life?
- This year has been
a nightmare, um, come true.
I've gotten to travel the world,
I've been the face of PETA,
I played Frank Furter in the
<i>Rocky Horror Picture Show,</i>
I came out with a whole album.
Um, what the crown can do
for you
is make all your dreams come
true if you let it.
- Yeah, wow.
- And it's been great to see
kids all over the world identify
with this, you know, kooky,
spooky, bat-shit crazy
drag queen
that I really thought would
just, uh, be making people
laugh in small bars
in Pittsburgh.
- Sharon, any words of wisdom
for America's Next
Drag Superstar?
- What other people think of you
ain't none
of your damn business.
- That's right.
- My advice, when in doubt,
freak 'em out.
And of course, what Lady Bunny
always says, "Retire!"
[both laughing]
- Oh, I almost forgot.
Do you have anything
to shamelessly plug?
- You can buy my album<i> PG-13</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
now available on iTunes.
Oh, and make sure to check out
all the fabulous music
that the<i> RuPaul Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> girls</i>

- Oh, Sharon.
I didn't know you were there.
You really are spooky.
I thought you had left.
- Boo.
- It's time to get up close
and personal
with top three queen
Roxxxy Andrews.
<i>Hey.</i>
Where my people at?
<i>A cute kid from Orlando,</i>
<i>Roxxxy Andrews got her start</i>
<i>as a pageant queen.</i>
<i>She dropped 70 pounds...</i>
70 pounds?
<i>Before dropping</i>
<i>into the competition.</i>
<i>But she never lost her thick</i>
<i>and juicy personality.</i>
<i>She won the first main</i>
<i>challenge,</i>
<i>then formed the super group</i>
<i>Rolaskatox.</i>
<i>A true knockout, Roxxxy always</i>
<i>came out swinging,</i>
<i>on the runway</i>
<i>or in the werk room.</i>
- This isn't a joke to me.
- I don't think--
- This competition
is extremely serious.
-<i> Roxxxy proved she could make</i>
<i>us laugh...</i>
- [with lisp] I am ready
to toss your salad, Anita.
Get your life.
-<i> Make us cry...</i>
- [crying]
-<i> And she could even make over</i>
<i>a soldier.</i>
<i>And in the music video,</i>
<i>Roxxxy's</i>

<i>girls away.</i>
She could also be the first big

to snatch the title of America's

Coming up...
<i>Untucked: The Lost Episode.</i>
Plus, a Ruvealing interview.
Don't mess with me, little boy.
And later, the music video world
premiere of<i> The Beginning.</i>
Don't move a love muscle because
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race:</i>
<i>Countdown to the Crown</i>
is about to pop off.
[laughing]
[laughing]
Now, sometimes when you tuck
things away, they get lost,
especially if you've been
sitting all day.
But lucky for you,
the long-lost episode
of<i> Untucked</i>
has not only been found,
it's been restored,
filled with extra
dramatic sound effects,
and brought to us by its host:
the one and only RuPaul.
Hello, hello, hello.
My dear, you look gorgeous.
Oh, you.
So what do you got for us?
Girl, it's a doozy.
I can't wait.
Rupaul, is it true that you
never get to see<i> Untucked</i>
until the show airs?
Yes, I see it
when America sees it.
They shoot<i> Untucked</i><span style="bodyStyle"> when the</i>
judges and I are deliberating.
So it's not like I can be
in two places at once.
Duh.
Duh!
Now, Ru, while I have you here,
fans are dying to know what was
up with your lighting, girl,
in season one?
We couldn't even see you, child.
"Exsqueeze" me?
And just how damn old are you?
Oh, it's gonna be like that,
huh?
Are those your real teeth?
Well, I bought 'em.
Hey, Urkel, uh, you trying to go
<i>Untucked</i><span style="bodyStyle"> on me right now?</i>
Don't mess with me, little boy.
Oh, no "T," no shade,
Miss Thing.
Let's keep it cute.
Yeah, uh-huh.
That's what I thought.
Now, without further ado,
for the first time anywhere,
<i>Untucked: The Lost Episode.</i>
Welcome to<i> Untucked.</i>
This week, our top three queens
took it to court,
stating their cases for becoming
America's Next Drag Superstar.
- What they don't have,
I do have.
I have grace.
I have beauty.
I have professionalism.
- I was able to adapt and grow
while still being true
to who I am as a performer.
- Roxxxy was faced with
a challenge of presenting
a 16-year-old girl.
What did she present?
A tawdry, 27-year-old tramp.
And Jinkx Monsoon, she failed
three different looks.
-<i> Afterwards, Roxxxy, Alaska,</i>
<i>and Jinkx</i>
<i>headed to</i>
<i>the Interior Illusions Lounge</i>
<i>to have an Absolut cocktail</i>
<i>and let off some steam.</i>
- So how do y'all feel?
- Well, I wrote out the things
that I was gonna say
specifically about you two.
Then all of it seemed forced.
I was ready to tear down Roxxxy
and compare myself to Alaska.
But on the stage,
none of that seemed to matter.
- I knew exactly where I wanted
to go with it and made,
like, an outline.
But when I went to on the stage,
I was just coming
from the heart.
I made a choice not to call
everybody out on this runway
because doing that is not me.
- I just did the assignment.
I mean, we were supposed to,
like, cite exact things.
- Oh, Miss Thing.
Like, I could've sat there and
critiqued Jinkx and, you know,
critiqued Alaska
and these things--
I didn't wanna go there.
I just wanted to say--
- But I think that's
what they wanted us to do.
The assignment was specifically
not to give pageant answers.
Sorry, it's hard,
but it's our last challenge.
- I don't know.
I-I--all I could say was
that what I have,
you guys don't have, so--
- Like beauty and grace?
You said that onstage.
- No, I know.
- I may not have grace...
- [slurping]
- But I can possess beauty.
You can take a garbage bag
and be a fucking beauty queen.
You can be glamorous without,
like, 1,000 million stones
on your dress.
- It's just how I know
how to do drag.
Right now in the gold bar,
there's a lot of tension.
It was, once again,
my defense going up.
And I realized
that I owed them an apology.
This has been such
a learning experience.
In the pageant world, I feel
like I'm on top of my game.
And coming into this,
it's a whole nother story,
where you're up against
all these girls
that can beat you
at other things.
You're competing to be
the Next Drag Superstar.
And a superstar is not just
someone who can walk a runway
in a gown and be--
you know,
anybody can kinda do that.
- Except us.
- [laughs] Exc--
- Except you two 'cause you--
you can't possess it.
But, you know,
and anybody can do that.
And it's so much more than that.
- You know what's so funny,
is it has really been a similar
experience for me,
but in such a different way.
It got to a point where I felt
so attacked by other drag queens
because I have my own way
of doing things.
And then I come here,
and then all of a sudden
I'm not a pretty girl,
I'm the comedy girl.
Where back home, I'm, like, one
of the prettiest drag queens
there are.
- And I didn't have to bring it
up on the runway,
but I really
wanted to apologize for what
I said to you in the werk room.
It was being mean and--
and I didn't mean it.
- It meant something to me that
you apologized,
just so that our last
interaction together
didn't have to be a fight.
-<i> Wow. Bam, bam.</i>
Oops.<i> </i>
<i>Bam, bam.</i>
Oh!<i> </i>
<i>On fire.</i>
Oh!
You caught me playing
with myself.
I mean, playing my fabulous new
game,
the<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> edition</i>
of<i> Dragopolis,</i>
available May 6th for iPhone
and iPad on the App Store.
<i>Fierce!</i>
Now, which one
of my top three girls
is your Next Drag Superstar?
Are you Team Alaska, Team Jinkx,
or Team Roxxxy?
Don't go away.
Because we've got
the world premiere
of the music video
<i>The Beginning,</i>
as<i> RuPaul's Drag Race: Countdown</i>
<i>to the Crown</i><span style="bodyStyle"> continues.</i>
[whirring]
[laughing]
[laughing]
One week from tonight, herstory
will be made as we crown
America's Next Drag Superstar
at<i> RuPaul's Drag Race: Reunited.</i>
Who do you think deserves
to win...
the witty and wild Alaska...
- Hi-yee!
- This year's consummate
chameleon,
evolving at every turn?
Or the sleeper queen,
Jinkx Monsoon,
who brought Broadway brass
and vintage va-va-voom?
Or bronze bombshell
Roxxxy Andrews,
the queen of wham, bam,
thank you, glam?
I wanna hear from you.
Tweet us @RuPaulsDragRace.
Comment on Facebook and make
your voices heard everywhere.
Thanks to my countdown
correspondents,
Latrice, Willam,
and Sharon Needles.
And most of all,
I wanna thank you,
all my squirrel friends
out there watching at home.
We couldn't do it without you.
The world premiere of my new
music video<i> The Beginning</i>
is dedicated to you.
And remember,
if you can't love yourself,
how in the hell are
you gonna love somebody else?
Can I get an amen up in here?
all: Amen.
- That's right, baby.
Now let the music video play.
- These are serious allegations.
-<i> We have one thing to say.</i>
all: No comment.
[laughter]
- I plead innocent.
- I'm guilty of being fierce.
- You can't handle the "T."
- You're out of order.
- We want the "T."
- You can't handle the "T"!
- Sickening!
- The accuser
is one cold-blooded biatch.
- Objection!
Reading the witness.
- This had better be good.
- The murder weapon--
a size three stiletto.
- I wear a size 14.
- I can't face it.
I can't face it!
- What is it you can't face?
- [spits]
You're out of order!
You're out
of order!
Why, I ought to throw the book
at all of you.
- Jesus!
What the--
- [grunts]
You, over here!
- Aah!
Court dismissed.


- Previously on<i> </i>
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race...</i>
- Rolaskatox is Roxxxy,
Alaska, and Detox.
- I have narcolepsy.
[snores]
- You'll be writing
and recording
an inspirational anthem.
- Coco, there's a lot
of pressure on you
to start this out.
- Yeah.
Thanks, Detox.
- For what?
- What's going on with you
and Detox?
- Rolaskatox.
- No!
Cliques can be dangerous.
- Jinkx Monsoon.
- There was, like, 20 different
eras going on.
She's consistently a mess.
- This week's winner
is Ivy Winters.
- Thank you so much.
[giggles]
- Coco Montrese,
shantay, you stay.
Jade, sashay away.
- Thank you guys.
- Oh, Jade.
- "Cheers to my fish, fabulous,
and fierce sisters."
- We love you, Jade.
- Oh, God.
Bottom two twice.
I can't let Ru down anymore.
I'm not gonna take it
for granted anymore.
So you bitches
better look the fuck out.
- Oh!
- Ivy, you won your challenge.
- I know!
- Congratulations.
[cheers and applause]
- And you always look amazing
on the runway.
I had my fingers crossed I could
possibly win two challenges
in a row, but, I mean, Ivy,
it was very well-deserved.
- Jinkx likes to play
the "I think I did good,
"but I don't know.
They really hate my runways."
You're acting like
a little wounded girl,
and I'm fixing to call you out.
- Has everyone won
a challenge except--
have you won a challenge?
- Except me--a mini-challenge.
- And me, I haven't won.
- We're the only ones.
- It's just so hard
being here in Sharon's shadow.
She won four challenges.
This is not the place for me
to be supporting cast.
I have to show that I do
stand alone.
all: Rolaskatox.
- I don't want to be part of
Rolaskatox.
I want to be Alaska.
- The winner of<i> RuPaul's</i>
<i>Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> receives</i>
a sickening supply of
Colorevolution cosmetics,
a luxury trip
courtesy of alandchuck.travel,
headline Logo's<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> tour</i>
featuring Absolut vodka--
cocktails perfected--
and a cash prize of $100,000.
And tonight, extra special
guest judges Leslie Jordan
and Absolut's Jeffrey Moran.
- Rolaskatox.
- Rolaskatox.
It's a new day in the WERK room.
I know what I have to do,
and I'm gonna do it.
Alaska!
- What?
- Oh, she said Alaska.
Did your friend leave y'all?
- No more Rolaskatox?
- We can't do cliques.
It's too dangerous.
I guess it's just Rotox now.
It's hard to say
to Detox and Roxxxy
that I don't want to be
in this little girl group
that we had together.
- Ooh, she broke the group up.
- Smart girl.
[alarm sounds]
- Ooh!
- Ooh, girl, you got shemail.
<i>Hey, queens.</i>
all: Hey.
<i>- It's feeding time.</i>
<i>So if you've got a beef,</i>
<i>it's time to start slinging</i>
<i>sass and serving insults.</i>
- Ah!
<i>- But never ever let them</i>
<i>see you choke.</i>
<i>[chokes]</i>
all: Uh-oh!
- Hello, hello, hello.
all: Hi, Ru!
- Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo!
- Ladies, in the great
tradition of<i> Paris is Burning,</i>
get ready to visit the library,
darlings.
[cheers and applause]
Because reading is what?
all: Fundamental!
- That's right, that's right.
First up, Detox, the library
is open.
- Oh.
Roxxxy Andrews, condragulations
on the weight loss, but to me,
you're still Boxxxy Mandrews.
[all laugh]
Alyssa Edwards.
Overbites are very "in"
this season.
Too bad your performance here
is so underwhelming.
- Oh-oh!
- [laughs]
- Sharon Needles--what? No?
[all laugh]
I've had it.
- Jinkx Monsoon.
- Roxxxy Andrews, there are
two types of peanut butter,
creamy and crunchy.
[all laugh]
- I'm not crunchy, baby.
- Detox, you won the challenge.
You can take the chicken mask
off now.
[all laugh]
- [clucking]
- Roxxxy Andrews.
- Coco Montrese, for someone
who calls themself a top,
you sure do like
being on the bottom.
- Ooh!
[all laugh]
- Jinkx Monsoon,
ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
You're great at the challenges,
but on the runway,
you're a bust.
[all laugh]
- Detox, is Amanda Lepore
your mother?
'Cause there's a lot of silicone
going on there.
- Ooh.
- Jinkx Monsoon,
Boy George called.
He wants his hat back.
- [gasps]
- Ooh.
- Alyssa Edwards.
Never mind.
all: Ooh!
- Ivy Winters.
I can't do it
because reading you
is like reading
a Walt Disney book.
It's simply too easy.
[all laugh]
Detoxic.
Honey, I know you think
you're serving body and look,
but the only thing I'm getting
is<i> The Hills Have Eyes.</i>
- Uh-oh.
- Ms. Coco.
You must be blind
because it looks like
you're using Tang
for your highlights.
- [laughs]
- Aah!
- Ms. Alaska, I think you should
wear a mask
for every challenge.
- [laughs]
I don't want to read
these girls.
I love them so mu--all right,
let's go.
[all laugh]
Alyssa Edwards, Miss USA--
Oh, wait.
[all gasp]
- Why are you laughing?
- Detox, you're so seductive,
but unfortunately, it's illegal
to do it with you
because most of your parts
are under 18 years of age.
[all laugh]
Long story short, the season of
the fish smells like trout.
[all laugh]
I don't know what came over me.
- The library
is now officially closed.
The winner of today's
mini-challenge is...
Alaska.
[applause]
- Whoo!
- You shady bitch.
Ladies, for this week's
main challenge,
you're going to get
a chance to read...
me.
[all shout]
- Nuh-uh.
- You'll be competing
in the RuPaul Roast.
- Aah!
- Oh, my God.
- What?
- Proudly presented by Absolut.
Over 30 years ago, Absolut Vodka
was one of the first spirits
to support the gay and lesbian
community.
They were also the first
to launch
a citron and a mandarin vodka,
making the world
a fruitier place,
one cocktail at a time.
Now in that spirit, you need to
write and perform
outrageous material that really
lets me have it...
plus the judges...
plus each other.
No one's safe at a roast,
chickens.
Now to help you prepare,
you'll be working with
three professionals:
the shelarious Nadya Ginsburg...
- [gasps]
- Deven Green...
- Oh!
- And the one and only
Bruce Vilanch.
[all cheering]
- Alaska, you won the
mini-challenge,
so you'll decide the order
of the presenters.
- Oh.
- Gentlemen,
start your engines.
And may the best woman win.
- Does anyone have a preference
as to going early, late?
'Cause I don't want to fuck
anyone over.
- I would prefer to go
just in the middle.
- In the middle? Okay.
- Me too, in the middle
for me too.
- I want to go after you.
- Where are you
putting yourself?
- No one wants to go first.
But, I mean, I don't mind
going first.
Is that okay?
- Yeah.
- That's the hardest one.
Wrong move.
- This challenge is important
because everyone knows me
as a comedy queen.
So there's high pressure
right now
to put my money
where my mouth is.
- It's so hard to think of,
like, mean things to say
about her.
- Ivy's very sweet
and well-mannered.
And in a roast,
that's gonna be hard.
- I am just trying to, like,
really rack my brain.
And I still can't think
of one joke.
- Coming up...
- I put myself first.
- Are you going for
Miss Congeniality
or America's next
drag superstar?
- Girl, that's fake to me.
- I'm not acting when I say
I'm insecure about things.
- Bullshit.
- [laughs]
[laughs]
- The main challenge this week
is to roast RuPaul,
as well as our fellow queens
and the judging panel.
I just have to kick ass at it,
because at a drag show,
when you bomb,
you don't just hear crickets.
You hear shotguns
getting cocked.
- I can't read this last one.
Because they're gonna be like,
t--
Humph.
- I keep hearing, "Ooh!"
- Oh, my gosh.
- "Ooh, um--"
- [mutters]
- "Oh, no, I can't."
- Oh, my gosh, y'all.
I can't do it.
I'm gonna have to rewrite it.
I'm gonna read y'all
the beginning of mine.
Tell me if it's too much.
"RuPaul, where should I start?
"With the cracked-out
beginning of your career
or the cracking of your voice
at every live performance?"
Oh, my gosh.
Y'all, am I just gonna be too--
Is that too much, Roxxxy?
[laughs]
[rubs hands together]
- She's saying her jokes
are so much
and she says her joke, bitch,
and you can hear crickets.
- I can't.
I can't.
I can't.
- You go back in your corner,
and you figure it the fuck out
and come back and talk to us
when you got
something together.
Darling.
- Hello, hello, hello.
[all shout]
- Oh, my!
- No, no, no.
- Since nobody knows RuPaul
better than me,
I am here to help you all
with your roast material.
- Oh, my God.
- Hello, Alaska.
- Hi.
- Tell me what you got.
You're a smart one.
- Well, I'm hitting her music,
her movies--
- What about the music?
- Ru, your music
is so auto-tuned
you make Cher sound like
Susan Boyle.
- [laughs]
Good.
It's so nice to see Alaska
again.
- Hi.
- Now, you won
the mini-challenge.
- Yes.
- So you were in charge
of the order.
- Mm-hmm.
- So how did you decide how
everybody was gonna go?
- I asked everyone if they have
a preference
as to if they want to
go in the beginning,
the middle, the end.
And I put myself first.
- Yeah, are--are you going for
Miss Congeniality
or America's
next drag superstar here?
- Um--
- In the end, someone's gotta
go down, right?
- Yeah.
- It could be you.
See you at the roast, baby.
Hi, Roxxxy girl.
- Hi, Michelle.
- Does this challenge
make you nervous?
- Reading is something
I've always done
to the queens at the bar.
You know, they think I'm a mean
girl anyways, but--
- How do you plan on reading
somebody like Ru?
- Her music, how she sings.
- How does she sing?
- It's auto-tune.
- Auto-tune seems to be
a common thing so far.
So you might want to listen,
and if something's repeated,
take it out or make it funnier--
- Than the person before you.
- Yes.
- And I can be funnier
than Alaska.
- [gasps]
- [laughs]
- Keep it funny.
That's all we can tell you.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Ivy Winters.
- Hi, beautiful.
- How are you?
- A little bit nervous,
to be honest.
I don't consider myself
a comedian,
so it's definitely
a challenge for me.
- What kind of topics are you
gonna be roasting Ru on?
- I know he wears
amazing costumes,
so I think I'm gonna
kind of hit on that.
- How are Ru's dresses funny?
I mean, they're flawless.
Give me another one.
- Um, I know Santino being
a sewer and he designs, um--
- Some sewing jokes?
Doesn't sound too funny.
Your page is empty.
- I think I've ripped out,
like, five pages.
I'm really trying to rack
my brain.
- Keep racking.
I'm gonna let you back at it.
Keep on keeping on, baby.
- All right.
- Coco Montrese.
Hi, gorgeous.
- How are you?
- How are you feeling about
this challenge?
- I'm not a comedian by--
by far,
but I'm taking a different
approach than, you know,
a lot of the other girls
in this competition.
I'm gonna be Coco Montrese,
Ru's old childhood friend
from the Brewster Projects.
- Okay.
I think it's important for you,
this challenge, Coco.
- Very.
I've been in the bottom twice.
- So let's deliver
this shit.
- I will deliver.
- All right.
- Thanks.
No RuPaulogies.
I'm not gonna apologize anymore.
I'm gonna show him
what I'm made of.
- Alyssa Edwards.
- Miss Michelle,
the first lady, how are you?
- I love it.
Are you a funny queen, Alyssa?
- With reading, some people
can take it personal.
- Okay, they can take it
personally if it's not funny.
But if it's funny,
you're almost forgiven.
It's, like, given a pass.
- Right.
But you know when you're with
your friends, and you're like,
"Girl, that outfit is tired
and ridiculous.
You look late.
Bitch, you need to go change."
- That's not a joke.
That's a read.
- It is, but it's still
being funny.
- It's not a joke.
- Not a joke, no.
And I've taken it personal
before because I had a girl
in this competition tell me
I was fat in my costume.
- It's not a joke.
Gotta be funny.
- Okay.
- It has to be joke after joke
after joke.
All right, so I'm gonna let you
go back to your work.
- Okay, thank you, Michelle.
- All right, baby.
Good luck.
All right, ladies.
Gather round.
In a moment, you'll be meeting
with your comedy coaches.
And tomorrow we'll be joined by
our extra special guest judges,
star of TV and stage,
Leslie Jordan...
[all cheer]
And Absolut Vodka guru,
Jeffrey Moran.
- Oh, yay.
- So come decked out in
your swankiest cocktail attire.
Oh, and one more thing.
You'll be roasting Ru
in front of a live audience.
- Oh, my gosh!
[all shout]
- Oh, shut up!
- So don't fuck it up.
Byesies.
- Bye.
- [snores]
I do have narcolepsy,
and in the moment where I'm most
worried about my jokes,
my body
starts to shut down.
- You might think I want to say
"Jinkx, wake up."
But sorry, girl.
- [snores]
- Coming up...
- Santino, will you please shut
the fuck up?
[laughs]
- It has to be funny.
Seriously.
- [laughs]
[laughs]
- Jinkx is here.
- Hi, Jinkxy.
- Hi, Jinkx.
- Our coaches today are
Deven Green, Bruce Vilanch,
and Nadya Ginsburg.
I am most shaken by Deven Green.
I have been doing her "welcome
to my home" video shtick
for years.
So I'm just gonna rattle through
all of this.
- Cool.
- RuPaul, you are pulled--
[clears throat]
RuPaul in her heyday would have
made--ah.
I ruined it.
- Stop being such an adult,
and be a fun-loving performer.
- Okay.
My career as a comedian
might be on the line here.
- RuPaul, how do you get to be
supermodel of the world?
When you find out,
can you let me know?
- Well, that is a starting point
for somewhere
that you didn't go.
Just go deeper, as somebody
once said to me
who I never dated again.
- Don't be afraid to go out
there and really be as vicious
as you can because that's
the name of the game.
- I would write that down.
It's a great note.
- I'm writing that down.
- Let's talk about
Michelle Visage.
Everybody, Michelle Visage.
She's lovely.
Who did your boob job, Michelle?
Boobsforqueens.com?
They--they do breast plates
for drag queens.
- I think you need something
a little easier to process.
Just make sure you really
drive it home.
- Coco!
- Tomorrow I'm just going with
I'm Ru good friend
from the projects.
Ru don't know I'm gonna be here.
You know, straight from
the hood.
It's gonna be a stretch for me.
- [laughs]
- All right.
- I'ma say, "you know, Ru,
"I want to know
what you gonna do
"when that entourage of makeup
artists you got go on strike.
I seen you do your makeup
by yourself, fool."
- I would be mindful of--
it should be light-hearted,
not malicious and mean-spirited.
- Like her face has been beat
more times than Susan Lucci
at the Daytime Emmys.
- Right.
- Coco is not a comedian.
But RuPaul's long lost friend
from the Brewster Projects
is a comedian.
She tell it like it t-i-is.
And she ain't apologizing for it
while she pat her weave.
- Okay, Mr. RuPaul Charles.
After your less award-earning
role in<i> Starrbooty,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
you should not only sashay away,
but jump off a damn cliff.
[laughs]
- I think the general rule
in a roast is
it's great to be evil,
but it has to be funny.
You gotta have a couple of
jokes, seriously.
- Santino, will you please shut
the fuck up
with your
no-drag-knowledge mouth?
[laughs]
- Do you have any more jokes?
- [chuckles]
- I'll just start with my whole
spiel about Leslie Jordan.
The movie<i> The Help</i><span style="bodyStyle"> is chock-full</i>
of unbelievable performances.
The most unbelievable is you
being a heterosexual.
Leslie, you're gayer than George
Michael fucking Elton john.
- It's important
that you not rush.
Take your time.
- And find the funniest nugget.
Take it even one step further
with some of the punch lines.
- Ru and the rest of the judges
are expecting a lot out of me.
I have to be funny.
- Roxxxy.
Let's hear your material.
- Okay, let's start with Ru.
Your laugh is as fake as
Lee Press-On Nails.
They're sticky, annoying,
and never fun.
Then again,
so is Alyssa Edwards.
- What do you call it
when you flatline?
- You're dead.
- Code blue.
- Thank you.
More, more.
What else do you have?
- Yeah, what else--what are
your other jokes?
- Okay, the other one I have for
Ru is
"Ru, your acting to me
is very cute.
Unlike all the girls that are
left in this competition."
- Well, that's--
it's not really funny.
It's just an insult.
- When the coaches completely
rejected what I was giving them,
it threw me, and I'm completely
defeated.
Like, first joke off the bat
was just, like,
"Oh, mm, you're not
making us laugh.
Okay, what else do you have?"
And I was like...
I'm, like, redoing my whole
script right now.
That was the first time I just
wanted, like, to leave and cry.
It sucks.
[sighs]
- Today we will be roasting
the legendary Ms. RuPaul.
Not only am I nervous
that we're doing comedy,
but it's in front of
a live audience.
Honey, tonight I am shaking
in my pumps.
- Ms. Jinkx standing over there
looking like the mad hatter
right now.
What's this challenge?
<i>Alice in Wonderland?</i>
- Coco, why are you still doing
your ventriloquist dummy makeup?
all: Ooh!
- Jinkx try to act like
she innocent
and that she's not reading.
- I don't act
like I'm innocent.
- Now, Ms. Jinkx, I want to ask
you this for real, girl.
Do you feel like you deliver
glamour?
- I don't think I deliver
anything but what I deliver.
And what I've been delivering
lately
has been a big, old confusion.
- That's all bullshit.
I'm not believing that.
- You ain't buyin', Ms. Roxxxy?
She's sellin', and you ain't
buyin'?
- I ain't buyin' shit.
You come across as
"I don't think I'm gonna win,
but I'm just here doing good
until I can't do good anymore."
- I feel like sometimes when I
do well in the challenges,
I don't really get to feel
that great about it
because I get
beat down on the runway.
It's my own thing I'm tackling.
- Girl, that's fake to me.
You know what you can do,
but you play the card
as the innocent,
"I don't know.
Maybe I'm in the bottom two."
And I feel like, you know--
- Yeah, it's just like,
really, girl?
- I'm not acting when I say I'm
insecure about things, though.
- Ms. Jinkx, you know exactly
what I'm saying,
you know
what role you're playing.
- I know what you're saying,
and I do not agree with you.
It is not an act when I tell you
I'm nervous about shit.
That's how I feel.
- Okay, well, girl,
if you're not gonna take
the constructive criticism
and how I'm just trying to
explain to you how I feel.
- Many jokes and two faces...
- Ooh!
- Jinkx Monsoon!
- [laughs]
Welcome to the main stage of
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
Michelle Visage, are you ready
for some roasting?
- Bring it on, bitches.
- [laughs]
Santino Rice.
- I am ready to get ribbed for
her pleasure.
- [laughs]
Leslie Jordan, are you scared
just a little bit?
- Terrified.
- Good. You should be.
Absolut's Jeffrey Moran,
what flavor of Absolut
would this be?
- Absolut Pears in the
Garden of Good and Evil.
- Mm, evil.
This week we challenged
our queens
to sharpen their comedic skills
in the first ever
RuPaul Roast.
So enjoy your Absolut cocktails,
and remember, if you can't laugh
at yourself,
how in the hell are you
gonna laugh at somebody else?
[laughs]
Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best woman win.
Coming up...
- You know at the beginning
of the show
you come in the room, girl,
pants so high.
He look like he in New Orleans
in Hurricane Katrina, girl.
[all laugh]
- [laughs]
[laughs]
[cheers and applause]
- Hello, everyone, and welcome
to the first ever RuPaul Roast.
[cheers and applause]
You all know Leslie Jordan.
[cheers and applause]
Don't lie.
No, you don't.
[all laugh]
Leslie Jordan is the only man
on earth
to have fucked more gay men
than Michelle Visage.
[all laugh]
Michelle Visage.
You can take the girl
out of New Jersey,
but you can't keep the girl
from giving blow jobs
to homeless men
along the New Jersey turnpike.
But we're here
celebrating RuPaul.
RuPaul, you've been
in the industry
a long, long, long, long, long,
long, long time.
RuPaul is so old that
the Hindenburg disaster
nearly destroyed
her bat mitzvah.
[all laugh]
RuPaul is so old that her
colostomy bag is made of wood.
[all laugh]
RuPaul is so old that
when she opens her legs,
all you hear is--
[raspy exhale]
[all laugh]
She's done movies, music,
television,
and I have just one thing
to say.
Please stop immediately.
[all laugh]
Thank you, mama.
We love you.
[cheers and applause]
It is my great pleasure
to bring to the stage
our next "entertainer."
Roxxxy Andrews.
And that's Roxxxy with three Xs,
just like her dress size.
- Oh!
- Thank you, Alaska...
a tired, boring, weird,
second-rate version
of your husband.
[audience ohs]
You know, RuPaul, you love it
for all of us
to call you our mom.
How the fuck
can I call you my mom
if you're as old
as my grandpa?
[faint laughter]
Michelle Visage,
with that much makeup,
all of your wigs, and...
light on your face,
maybe we should call you...
Michelle Mirage.
[scattered laughter]
RuPaul, I want to thank you
for having me here tonight.
- Y'all, I'm so happy
to be here.
I never been out the house.
It's been a long time, y'all.
I'm Ru good cousin
from the Brewster Projects.
She didn't know I was
coming tonight.
You didn't know I was gonna be
here, did you?
- [laughs] No.
- And Michelle--you go back
with Michelle
farther than you go back
with me.
You knew Michelle when Michelle
was Michael.
[all laugh]
So I'm flipping through the
channels, I say, "You seen Ru?
Ru on TV!"
I say, "What the hell is he
thinking?"
You know, at the beginning
of the show,
you come in the room, girl.
"Hello, hello!"
Girl, you look like the black
Pee Wee Herman.
[all laugh]
Pants so high.
He look like he in New Orleans
in Hurricane Katrina, girl.
[riotous laughter]
[cheers and applause]
- It's gonna be hard to top
Coco.
But look at her.
Who would want to top Coco?
[all laugh]
Michelle Visage is so full
of semen.
Period.
[all laugh]
No, seriously.
She's a whore.
Now on to the grand
high bitch herself.
Ru, what I admire most about you
is your ability
to look at these tired queens
and always find
a compliment for them.
You're so full of shit,
the toilet's jealous.
[all laugh]
Give it up for RuPaul.
- Hello, everyone.
Having sex with Santino is a lot
like Ru's music career...
Awkward.
- You would know.
- [laughs]
- I feel like
whenever Michelle farts,
a fairy gets her wings.
[all laugh]
Speaking of fairies,
hello, Leslie.
RuPaul, with these long legs
and feathers you like to wear,
you're one step away
from looking like
Big Bird's grandmother.
[audience oohs]
[cheers and applause]
- I thought I had auditioned
for<i> RuPaul's Next--</i>
[microphone feedback]
<i>Drag queen of the year.</i>
[microphone feedback]
Little did I know I was walking
into the largest cross-dressing
convention of all time.
[scattered laughter]
But this is about you,
mother Ru...
From the cracked-out nights
in the bathroom
or the cracking of your voice
at every live performance.
This was the best bunch
of people
you could get to come judge?
Can I get a gay man?
Santino Rice, what the hell you
know about winning something?
But you and Coco Montrese do
share something in common, okay.
And that's not only
your foolish wardrobe,
but being a runner-up--
- Oh...
- Don't get bitter.
Just get better.
[microphone feedback]
I thank you, and good night.
[applause]
- Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.
Wasn't he delightful?
[all laugh]
God bless him,
he tried his hardest.
Oh, fuck.
Where do I fucking start?
Oh, God.
Let's start with Leslie Jordan.
It's great to see you.
[chuckles]
<i>The Help</i><span style="bodyStyle"> is one of my most</i>
favorite movies of all time.
And your performance
was quite unbelievable.
Because you played
a heterosexual male.
You are fucking gayer than the
Fire Island production of<i> Rent.</i>
[all laugh]
But enough with that old queen.
Let's talk about the other
old queen on the panel,
Michelle Visage.
[all laugh]
Let me just look at my little
notes really quick, fuck.
God, I had to write little
to fit all this in.
[laughter]
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Michelle's favorite movie in the
world is<i> Showgirls.</i>
And much like Nomi Malone,
she relies on the talents
of her black friend.
[all laugh]
Ru, you are a fucking legend.
And I just hope that you're
having the time of your life.
Because you don't have much time
left.
[all laugh]
Good night, you guys.
Thank you so much
for coming out.
[cheers and applause]
- Coming up...
- You were trying too hard.
- It was boring,
it was humiliating,
and uncomfortable to watch.
- Wah-wah.
- [laughs]
[laughs]
Ladies, it's time for the
judges' critiques.
Let's start with Alaska.
- Hi.
- Comedy is like music.
It's something you hear
or you don't.
And you definitely
hear the music.
- Thank you.
- I thought you looked
beautiful tonight in your LBD.
And up there at the podium,
you were very funny,
but it's tough to go first.
You really should have taken it
even further.
- Moving on to Ivy Winters.
- Hey.
- We both wore green.
- I know.
- Yeah.
- You wore it best.
- [laughs]
- Tonight--I love you in green,
I love the red hair.
Not sure about the gloves.
- I love the gloves.
- I don't think you need them.
- During the roast, your
cards were a bit of a crutch,
and you kept looking at them.
- And you seemed
so unsure of yourself.
You were so nervous.
- Next up, Jinkx Monsoon.
- You have a career in or out
of drag in comedy.
You killed.
- Thank you.
- Jinkx, oh, Jinkx.
Let's start with
the runway look...
I love it!
- [laughs]
- Right hair, right makeup.
I am so friggin' proud of you.
- To hear that from
Michelle Visage, oh, my God,
that was worth its weight
in gold.
- Detox.
- Hi.
- You were so mean to me.
But there was a twinkle
in your eye.
Your tongue was firmly planted
in your cheek.
- The one thing I wasn't fond of
was you relying too much
on the word "fuck."
You can let the room breathe.
It's okay.
It was too much.
- Alyssa Edwards.
- You could have been
a little funnier.
And I thought you were trying
too hard.
- Going into the mic
and holding on, like,
for dear life,
I thought that was nerves.
But you're so gorgeous.
- Thank you.
- It wasn't your best moment
tonight.
- Okay.
- It was boring.
It was humiliating
and uncomfortable to watch.
- Coco Montrese.
- Not a roast, but a toast.
Mazel tov.
It was really spectacular.
- Thank you.
- Well done.
- Wanda Sykes, move over.
[all laugh]
It was hilarious.
- Tonight on the runway,
I like your look.
I'm thinking the earrings
and your roots showing,
it added to the humor.
- Roxxxy Andrews.
- Keep your pace up.
You needed to be quicker.
- It wasn't as smooth.
You could have strung it
together better
so that it was
much more fluid.
- Tonight your dress
is high-end,
and you really needed
some bigger hair to go with it.
- Well, ladies,
I think we've heard enough.
While you enjoy
an Absolut cocktail
in the Interior Illusions
Lounge,
the judges and I
will deliberate.
Just between us roasted
chickens, what do you think?
Let's start with Alaska.
- Her look
is so predictable now.
- So you want to see
a different silhouette.
- Just once at least.
- Being first means you have
a little more expectation
to step out of the box.
But a lot of the things,
it's like, I sort of expected
them.
- I just loved her.
She just, like, the kind of
knock-kneed,
and standing back there
and quirky and--
[exaggerated laugh]
It was refreshing to me.
- Moving on to Roxxxy Andrews.
- Roxxxy sees herself
as not funny,
and I think she was too much
in her head,
trying to
think how she can deliver it.
- And she seemed to be
out of character.
- I'd agree.
Roxxxy was stumbling from one
transition to the next.
It wasn't her night.
- She was really, really,
really nervous.
And I think it was just
a meltdown,
and it's hard to watch that.
- All right.
- Ivy Winters.
- She read her cards
the whole time.
She didn't connect once.
I didn't see her eyes.
I got no emotion from her.
And that's been my problem
with Ivy.
She's like a cardboard cutout.
- I didn't have a problem with
Ivy in that way, Michelle.
She wasn't as rough as some of
the other girls
with segueing from one joke
to the next,
and there was some really funny
moments.
- Coco Montrese.
- Great concept,
great delivery.
Very good tonight for Coco.
Especially coming from where
she was last week.
- Coco came out here tonight
with a new attitude.
She had consistent joke
after joke.
- I almost fell off the chair.
The whole time she was up there,
she stayed in that character.
I died.
- Jinkx Monsoon.
- Hallelu.
She looked great.
I was so very proud of her.
- I would have loved her
to have played more
with the other queens.
Reading them a little more.
Yes.
- I have two words:
master comedienne.
- All right, next up, Detox.
- We all know she's funny.
She could have done more and got
rid of some of the f-bombs.
- You know, the f-bomb
usually means
that someone's very nervous.
- You can laugh, but it's like,
oh, and another f-bomb,
oh, and another f-bomb.
And it's no longer funny
or bombastic.
- I expected more from her.
- Alyssa Edwards.
- The dress was a disaster
tonight.
I got prom feeling from it.
And then the roast--
wah-wah.
Intimidation.
- Yeah, that was it.
- Was she intimidated
by the other girls?
- Absolutely.
- Yeah.
- So many funny girls
up there tonight.
- They were--they were funny,
and I think she just--
she melted.
But I think she's beautiful.
- [laughs]
- She looks like
a fairy prince.
[all laugh]
- Silence.
I've made my decision.
Bring back...
my girls.
[laughs]
- [laughs]
Welcome back, ladies.
I've made some decisions.
Alaska, tonight you proved
you can stand on your own.
You're safe.
- Thank you.
[blows kiss]
- Jinkx Monsoon,
your look tonight was no joke.
Keep it up.
You're safe.
- Thank you.
- Coco Montrese.
As my hood rat cousin,
you tore me to shreds.
You are the winner
of this week's challenge.
Condragulations.
[applause]
You've won a custom gown
from SequinQueen.
- Coco Montrese is back.
Yes, God, I'm back, baby.
- Detox...
you're safe.
Alyssa Edwards,
tonight your punch lines
flatlined.
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
Ivy Winters, you struggled
to connect with the audience.
Roxxxy Andrews, tonight was not
your shining moment.
Ivy Winters...
you're safe.
Roxxxy Andrews, I'm sorry,
my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
- All of this stress
has just hit me.
This is honestly the first time
in this competition
that I felt
"You're not good enough."
- Two queens stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me
and save yourself
from elimination.
The time has come for you
to lip sync for your life.
- Get ready for the lip sync
of your life.
- Good luck.
And don't fuck it up.
- [laughs]
- There's no holding back.
There's no tip-toeing around.
I have to bring everything.
- Oh!
- I got a seizure
watching that.
- Alyssa is bringing it.
- [laughs]
- It's gonna be
a photo finish tonight.
[cheers and applause]
- Lost her shoe.
- All right, ladies.
- [crying]
Sorry.
- Are you okay?
- So many emotions.
- What's going on?
- Nothing.
Go ahead.
- No, tell me about it.
- It just hit me and...
like not feeling wanted
and not being good enough.
I just feel like my mom
never wanted me and--
my mother left my sister
and myself at a bus stop
when I was three.
And I remember it like it was
yesterday.
And, like, I come off
as this strong character.
I try to stay so strong,
but I'm so weak,
and I'm so tired.
[sobbing]
It just hurts that I was left.
Nobody cared.
- We love you.
And you are so welcome here.
You know, we as gay people,
we get to choose our family.
You know, we get to choose
the people that we're around.
You know what I'm saying?
I am your family.
We are a family here.
I love you.
- I love you.
- All right.
I've made my decision.
What you two did on this runway
is the passion
I am looking for.
Shantay, you both stay.
- [cries]
- [cries]
- Thank you so much.
- These are no longer just drag
queens I am competing with.
I'm growing attached
to these people.
We are like the seven sisters
right now.
- My seven sister queens.
If you can't love yourself,
how in the hell are you gonna
love somebody else?
Can I get a amen in here?
all: Amen!


- Previously
on<i> RuPaul's Drag Race...</i>
you get to enlist these men
into your drag house.
- Oh, shit.
I've never done anyone else's
makeup.
- You are going to be with
Roxxxy Andrews.
- I think it was sabotage.
It pissed me off.
[drum line playing]
- You made a gown for yourself,
and you gave your sister
the scraps that were kind of
left over.
- It seems like every week
I'm letting you down,
letting you down,
letting you down.
- Roxxxy Andrews, you are the
winner of this week's challenge.
[cheers and applause]
Detox, shantay, you stay.
- [crying] Thank you.
- Coco Montrese, sashay away.
- Thank you.
- Top four, bitches!
- Final four!
[all cheering]
- We're back in the werk room.
And after four lip syncs,
Coco is finally gone.
all: "I love you all.
Give them hell, girls."
- I plan on it.
- We love you, coquito.
- I think that her purpose here
was to get that whole Alyssa
and her thing accomplished and,
like, out of the way.
And I think that after she got
that, she was kind of just like,
"That's what I needed."
Coco Montrese was here because
she needed closure with Alyssa.
And you know what?
I'm here to be America's next
drag superstar.
- How about you, Miss Winner?
- Congratulations.
- I won a challenge, yay!
Day one, we walked in here as
Rolaskatox.
And, girl, here we stand with
little Jinkx.
No offense, Jinkx.
- Jinkx--it's like "Rolaskatox!
And Jinkx."
- Rolaskatox and Jinkx.
This is my worst nightmare
come true.
If one of them is given
the opportunity
to sell someone down the river,
they're gonna choose me.
- I have to go plot against
you guys.
- I need to go burn
Jinkx's costumes
from the '40s and
the '50s and the '30s.
- If we're doing a sewing
challenge, Jinkx is gonna be
left out with the tumbleweeds,
bitch.
She needs to go home.
[engine starts]
- The winner of<i> </i>
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> receives</i>
a sickening supply of
Colorevolution cosmetics,
a luxury trip courtesy of
ALandCHUCK.travel,
headline Logo's<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> tour,</i>
and a cash prize of $100,000.
And tonight extra special
guest judges
Bob Mackie
and Marg Helgenberger.
[tires squeal]
[upbeat music]
- Whoo-hoo!
- Oh!
- It's so empty.
- It's the top four.
We're a millimeter away from
being the top three.
And if I have to inch my way to
the top three, I'll do that.
And I deserve it.
It's so crazy
that it's almost over.
- It's just us.
- It's just getting down
to the nitty-gritty, honey.
- You two are gonna have
a lip sync this week.
I've had it with you guys
not lip-syncing at all.
- How are you supposed to be
America's next drag superstar
if they've never even seen you
perform?
- I would prefer to go to
the top without ever doing it,
like, Tyra Sanchez style.
[alarm blares]
- Ooh, girl!
- Saved by the bell.
- You've got shemail.
Hey, kit kats.
Don't snicker.
Sometimes you feel like a nut.
And sometimes you feel like
a $100,000 bar-none.
Use your whatchamacallit.
Kisses.
[giggles]
Hello, hello, hello.
all: Hi.
- You know, every now and then,
a drag queen needs to get things
off her chesticles.
So for today's mini challenge,
we're gonna have a good
old-fashioned bitch-fest.
And we're gonna do it with
puppets.
- Oh!
- [laughs]
- Why?
all: Everybody loves puppets!
- First, pick a puppet
that represents one of your
competitors.
Second, drag it up.
Third, you and the puppet have
a bitch-fest.
- [giggles]
- Detox, you're up first.
I want you to reach deep inside,
and I don't mean the pit crew's
Andrew Christian underwear.
- Oh, man.
Ooh, it's so squishy.
Alaska!
- Next up, Alaska.
- Isn't this a little high?
- Oh, my goodness.
It's like<i> A Fist called Wanda.</i>
- [laughs]
- [gasps]
Roxxxy!
- Jinkx Monsoon.
- Feed that hole, girl.
Who'd you get?
- Aw, DD.
- Next up, Roxxxy.
The suspense is killing me.
- I got Chucky.
[laughter]
It'll be so easy.
- All right, ladies.
On your mark, get set, go!
[dubstep music]
- I find the rattiest, dirtiest
blonde wig I can find,
then spray-adhesiving it
and rubbing it together,
making it matty and gross.
- I hate you, Detox.
- [chuckles]
- This is my opportunity to
make fun of Jinkx Monsoon.
I am painting the Nike check
cheek in black,
'cause that's
how she likes to contour.
- All right, ladies.
Time's up.
Let the bitch-fest begin.
- Detox, it's time to come out.
[as Detox] I've had it.
[normal voice] Detox, come out.
[as Detox] Fuck.
[laughter]
[as Detox] You ever been blown
by a girl with silicon lips?
I call it a slip 'n slide.
I mean, I just want to put my
mouth on it and go like this:
[babbling]
Meh!
[laughter]
- I don't know where she picked
up that slip 'n slide joke.
I've never said that.
I always call my mouth "my Black
&amp; Decker pecker wreckers."
- [as Detox] I've had it.
I've had it. I've had it.
- [laughs]
- [as Alaska]
Detox, I'm so upset.
[normal voice] Why, Alaska?
You look so gorgeous.
[as Alaska] But I don't have
any nice shoes!
Sharon got all the money, and I
can't get anything for myself.
Aah!
[normal voice] My whole idea was
to make her really whiny,
'cause Alaska has this kind of
whiny voice.
[as Alaska] Wah!
[normal voice] Okay, you need to
pull it together,
you bowlegged
fucking son of a bitch.
I've had it with you.
[laughter]
- Jinkx, girl, it's time for
the runway.
[as Jinkx] [snoring]
Jinkx?
Jinkx.
[as Jinkx] [snoring]
Huh? Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.
Do I look okay?
Can you guys help me with
my makeup?
Michelle told me that my cheeks
were too much.
Is this too much?
Is the blend okay?
[regular voice] So, Jinkx,
you think you're America's next
drag superstar.
[as Jinkx] You know, I try to
seem so innocent all the time,
but I'm really a bitch.
And I'm here to win,
and you guys have no idea.
[normal voice] Okay, Jinkx,
I've had enough.
You can go home.
[as Jinkx] Anyone know which way
Seattle is?
This way.
- That was rude.
- That wasn't rude.
- The shade of it all.
- Roxxxy, you look amazing.
Where'd you get your outfit?
[as Roxxxy] Same place I always
get my outfit, girl.
I made it ten minutes before I
got on the runway.
Hey!
Where my people at?
[normal voice] Oh, my god--
Roxxxy, I don't think that wig
is really working with this
outfit.
[as Roxxxy] That's okay, y'all.
I got another wig underneath!
[laughter]
[normal voice] I'm clocking
that tear-away.
[as Roxxxy]
Girl, I got a tear-away
underneath my tear-away!
- [laughs]
- A swimsuit!
Hey!
Where my people at?
Where my people at?
- Yeah, bitch, you better keep
repeating that,
'cause America's gonna know.
When they buy that song
on itunes,<i> Can I Get a Amen?,</i>
they're gonna say,
"Where my people at?"
- Wow, you girls didn't pull
any punches.
But one of you really made your
fellow queen eat it.
The winner is...
Alaska.
- [as Roxxxy] Hey!
Hey!
Where my people at?
- Ladies, I hope you left room
for dessert,
because for this week's
main challenge,
we're throwing the first ever...
[echoes] Sugar Ball.
You'll each need to whip up
three luscious looks.
First category is...
Super Duper Sweet 16,
teenage party girl.
Second category is Sugar Mama,
executive realness.
Third category is the tastiest
of them all,
Candy Couture.
- Ooh!
- Edible eleganza.
You'll be making high-calorie
fashion
using these sticky and
sweet confections
provided by Candy Warehouse.
Alaska, you won
the mini challenge,
so you get
a 15-second head start.
Go.
[upbeat music]
- Gentlemen,
start your engines.
And may the best woman win.
- Ooh!
- This challenge is about
sewing and creating.
Aah, my balls!
These bitches don't know how
to sew.
This is my element of drag.
- Does everyone know
what kind of direction
they're gonna go in?
- I know exactly the direction
I'm going in.
- Do you?
- Yes.
I'm going Alexander McQueen
does Christmas.
[chuckles]
- Girl, she's going for
a winter wonderland look, bitch.
- It looks crazy.
Just 'cause you throw some
antlers on your goddamn head
and you call it
an Alexander McQueen look?
Good luck, Jinkx.
- Coming up...
- I've fucking had it.
- Girl, could you please stop
banging?
- Are you passionate about
becoming America's next drag
superstar?
- [laughing]
[techno music]
- This week's main challenge
is the first ever Sugar Ball,
where we have to create three
different looks--
a Sweet 16 party girl look,
a Sugar Mama executive realness
look,
and a Candy Couture
fashion look.
- I'm gonna eat
my entire costume.
- Alaska, do I remind you
of someone?
- Detox!
- They're not that big of
a stretch, really.
- Hello, hello, hello.
- Hi.
all: Hello.
- How are things going here
on the good ship<i> Lollipop?</i>
- Delish.
- Alaska.
- Hi.
- I came over to borrow a pair
of edible panties.
May I eat this pair?
- You can eat those shorts
all day.
- Oh, wait.
These aren't edible.
[sniffs]
Ew!
- Ew!
- [laughs]
Now I want to hear all about
your Candy Couture look.
- I like, like,
fluffy cotton candy.
- How are you putting the candy
on there?
It's just glued, right?
- Yeah, it's hot glue.
- Huh, interesting.
But you've been criticized
for being a little rough
around the edges.
You know, the stakes
are very high.
And you've really got to wow us
to get into that top three.
All right.
Can't wait to see it.
Hi, Jinkx.
You're not known for being
a seamstress.
- No.
- What are you doing?
- Well, I want to do, like,
Christmas in July candy cane
reindeer monster kind of thing.
- Wait now.
Say that again slower for me,
because I'm trying to get that
all up in there.
- Christmas in July candy cane
reindeer monster.
- Do you think it's too much,
though?
This your Candy Couture look.
- Yes.
- But where's the candy?
- Well, I'm going to look like
a candy cane overall.
- It's a candy challenge.
Where the candy at?
- And I'm very excited to give
the Sweet 16 a shot.
- Now, you know we're not
talking 1916, right?
- [laughs] Yeah.
Is it okay if I'm sweet 16
but in the '70s?
- Well, the judges have
challenged you
to be a little more, you know,
modern, contemporary.
Good luck.
- Thank you, Ru.
- Hey, Detox.
- Hi, Ru.
- So how are you gonna bring it
for your Candy Couture?
What do you have planned?
- I'm so in love
with acid green,
and I really want to do some
reptilian-looking...
- Uh-huh.
- Funk.
I don't know what I'm thinking
of yet, but I see it in my head.
- Detox's concept right now
is more based on a color.
I'm not seeing the candy
inspiration in it.
- I'm just trying to play it
all by ear.
- Well, now, looking
around the room,
it looks like you're
a little bit behind.
Now, last week, you were
in the bottom two.
- I know.
- There's a certain expectation
that, um, really just hasn't
been met.
I don't know what to say
about that.
- Right. I don't--
I don't either, honestly.
- Are you passionate about
becoming America's next drag
superstar?
- It's kind of like a slap
in the face.
Of course I want to be America's
next drag superstar.
That's what I want.
It's something
that I've always wanted.
- All right, get to work.
See you in a minute.
Roxxxy Andrews.
- Hey, Ru.
- Now, top four,
every moment counts.
- It's $100,000 at stake here.
- $100,000 at stake.
- And that's no game.
It's gonna be a fight
till the end, baby.
- So tell me about your
Candy Couture outfit.
- My Candy Couture,
I'm going very extravagant,
very extravaganza.
- Now, how's your body-ody-ody
gonna play into this outfit?
- Well, it's a corset,
so I kind of brought it up
over here
so that you could still get
a shape on that side,
a good silhouette.
- Uh-huh.
Well, just, you know, make sure
it flatters your figure
and that, you know, you can
serve true Roxxxy Andrews.
- Mm-hmm.
- You know?
- Yeah.
Ru's looking at me funny,
and I'm not sure that he likes
what I'm doing.
- Yeah, yeah. Wow.
- Now what am I gonna do?
- You better bring some hard
Roxxxy candy on the runway.
Get back to work.
- Thank you, Ru.
- All right.
All right, gather around,
my little gumdrops.
Now, tomorrow at the Sugar Ball,
we'll be joined my our
extra special guest judges,<i> </i>
<i>CSI</i><span style="bodyStyle"> star Marg Helgenberger...</i>
- I love her!
- Whoo!
- And fashion's most delicious
designer.
Bob Mackie will be here.
[all gasp]
- What?
- Shut up!
- Ahh!
- Bob Mackie has done
Diana Ross, Liza Minnelli, Cher,
everybody.
He's a master at what he does.
- No pressure.
- Right.
- And there's just one more
thing.
In addition to creating your
three sickeningly sweet looks,
you need perform a<i> Sugar Babies</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
opening number.
Now, Alaska, as the winner
of the mini challenge,
you're in charge
of the choreography.
- Oh!
[laughs]
- Oh, god.
- Get your bowleg on.
all: Get your bowleg on.
Get your bowleg on.
- Alaska's got
about this much rhythm.
So this is gonna be
a hot fucking shitty mess.
- I expect to see sugar and
spice and everything nice,
so don't fuck it up.
See you later.
[indistinct chatter]
- After Ru's walk-through,
I look over, and Roxxxy's look
is completely gone.
- Ru said something
about my silhouette, so--
at this point in the game,
if she's saying something,
it's for a reason.
- Right.
- I'm starting
back at square one.
I'm going with this licorice.
It looks like spaghetti.
This licorice is so thin.
But I'm putting on there
one at a time.
It's so tedious.
So this much time,
this much work.
- [whistling]
[pounding]
- Jinkx, really?
I'm stressed right now.
I have a lot to get done.
Like, girl, could you please
stop banging?
- Jinkx and the hammer is
driving me berserk.
And I've fucking had it.
[pounding]
- Huh!
[pounding]
- Merry Christmas.
- Coming up...
- You're wrong, Jinkx.
Girl, it's left to right.
- 'Cause I don't want
to hit you
when you walk past me.
- If you hit me, I'm gonna
hit you right in the face.
- Aw, fuck.
It isn't going on.
What the fuck was that?
Aah!
I broke my entire outfit.
- [laughing]
[techno music]
- Today we have to come up with
a lip-sync performance
to a song called<i> Sugar Babies.</i>
All right.
- This musical number
is right up my alley.
This is me in my element.
- I'm no Alyssa Edwards when
it comes to choreography.
- You're not a choreographer
to the stars?
- I'm not.
We'll enter in that order--
you, her, her, me.
- You want us to enter and
go where?
And how do you want us to enter?
We all know Alaska is not
the best dancer,
so we don't know
what's gonna happen.
- We gotta do something else
here.
- [coughs]
- 'Cause this is totally cute
for the first part.
- Yeah.
- But then what are we gonna do?
Should we do, like, a little
up, down thing too?
Like, Alaska and I--
[laughs] yeah.
- It's confusing to me, though.
Alaska's lucky, 'cause if it was
some kind of pop, pop, booty,
kind of pop, pop, pop, pop, pop,
it'd be a hot mess.
- That's too complicated.
[laughs]
- It would be funny
if we did something
where we're licking the suckers
and then we're having, like,
a sugar high.
- Why don't we do
the circle thing?
They always do a circle thing.
- Jinkx is acting
a little too wild,
and I know Roxxxy and I are
getting annoyed.
We don't have time for any
of that bullshit.
Which way are you gonna start,
Rox?
- I'll start right to left.
- Okay.
- Left, right.
- Should we all be going
the same way?
- No, opposites.
- I can't see anybody,
so follow me.
- Well, you would have to--
yeah, we'll all follow you.
- Whoa.
- You're wrong Jinkx,
on the lollipop.
Girl, it's left to right.
It's not science.
- We're so off.
- We're all relying
on each other
to figure out where we're
moving our candy canes.
And Jinkx is going super fast.
It seems like she's trying to be
a scene stealer,
and that's throwing the rest
of the group off.
- The reason I keep
getting off, Roxxxy--
you pass by me so close
that I don't want to hit you
when I'm doing this.
- 'cause it seems like
you switch.
- Oh, I thought she was fine.
- But you were still off.
- 'Cause I don't want
to hit you
when you walk past me.
- If you hit me, I'm gonna
hit you right in the face.
Just sayin'.
- Roxxxy's grasping at straws
to try to shake me.
I think it's because I've never
had to lip-sync for my life.
And so any chance she gets,
she's coming for me.
- So, um, are you not
lip-syncing on purpose?
- I don't know it yet.
I don't even know
what I'm saying.
- I'm just checking.
We're all sort of at least
faking our way through
the lip sync, but, like,
Roxxxy's just, like, not moving
her mouth at all.
It's like, "Oh, okay."
- Do you want me and Detox
to end
with both of our hands up?
Or the right on the right hand,
left on the left hand,
and you in the middle?
- Yeah, that.
- Am I in the middle or
the side?
Where do you want me?
If it totally tanks,
I don't think
that it's anybody else's
responsibility
except for Alaska's.
- Whew!
- We're back in from rehearsal.
We all have a lot to do.
We have three looks to plan
for tomorrow.
And the tensions are high,
so let's get to fucking work.
- So, girls,
it's awfully quiet.
- Yeah, girl, we got work
to do.
- [yawns]
[snores lightly]
There is still so much to do.
And the narcolepsy kicks in,
and it's a struggle just to keep
my eyelids open.
I can't even see what I'm
looking at anymore.
[can rattling]
Oh, fuck.
I'm starting to get so tired.
Like, I'm half asleep,
trying to make a dress.
When I shake myself out of it,
I look at my dress,
and I'm like,
"What the fuck happened?"
This isn't what I wanted it
to look like.
I'm panicking, yeah.
- I've never seen Jinkx
so freaked out,
on the verge of tears.
A little part of me is so happy,
because the judges are finally
gonna see
that she's a whole hot
shitty trailer Christmas mess.
About time.
- Ugh!
- [fake crying]
- It's elimination day,
and we have a lot of work to do
for this Sugar Ball.
At the end of today, there will
only be three of us.
It's scary.
- Is it hideous,
or is it not hideous?
- I mean, it's a lot of stuff
going on.
- I mean, a big part of me
just wants to ditch
the big hoop skirt thing,
but then I only have candy
on my corset.
- Right.
- I'm going back and forth.
It's like cut this and lose
most of the candy
and most of the work I did
or keep this
and risking looking like
a complete joke on the runway.
I feel like an idiot.
- How much work does everyone
have left to do?
- I still have to, like, finish
this jewelry up
and then put a strap
on this dress.
And then I'm gonna start working
on hair.
Did you change anything?
- I just added some more candy,
And I need to finish adding
candy.
I'm liking it a lot much better
now I added these little
carnation things to it.
I'm gonna do a couple more.
- I love it.
- Detox's Candy Couture outfit
doesn't look candy-inspired
in the slightest.
Herein lies the problem
of having a best friend
in this competition.
Roxxxy's so close to Detox,
she can't bring herself to say,
"Detox, that dress doesn't read
as candy."
- Aw, fuck. Goddamn.
What is wrong with this?
I don't know why
it isn't going on.
It's fucking pissing me off.
We're completely running out
of time.
This was supposed to just go on
and look good,
and that's not happening.
[object clatters]
What the fuck was that?
Aah!
- What just happened?
- The candy is falling off.
Chunks of the cotton candy
clouds are just shattering.
- Fuck cok-sucking hell shit.
I broke my entire outfit, so--
- What?
- I don't know how this thing's
going to get down the runway.
I'm completely panicking
right now.
Ow.
- Alaska and Jinkx,
they're both the weakest
in the competition.
- Jesus Christ.
- It's time for them to
lip-sync for their life.
- Coming up...
- It makes me question
your taste level.
- She was a really
promiscuous-looking 16-year-old.
- You know, they want to look
like a whore.
- [laughing]
[laughing]
[RuPaul's<i> Cover Girl</i><span style="bodyStyle"> ]</i>
Welcome to the main stage
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
Michelle Visage, hey, sugar.
- You are giving me Jersey
couture tonight, honey.
- [laughs]
- Santino Rice, you want
some candy, little boy?
- Oh, yes, please.
- Marg Helgenberger,
you look scrumptious.
- Thank you, Ru.
You look fabulous
in that animal print.
- So happy to have you here.
And he's back!
The very first judge of
the very first episode
of<i> Drag Race,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
my idol, Bob Mackie.
- You're looking gorgeous.
- You know what I always say:
Cher was born naked,
and the rest was Bob Mackie.
[laughter]
This week, our queens were like
kids in a candy store,
creating three different
sartorial confections.
Are you ready to get
this Sugar Ball rolling?
- Hell yes!
- Yes, ma'am.
- Gentlemen,
start your engines.
And may the best woman win.
[whimsical music]
Yeah!
[laughter, applause]
- Let the Sugar Ball begin.
Category is Super Super
Sweet 16.
Oh, my god.
First up, Alaska.
Hi!
- Dad got me this nose for
my birthday.
- Yes.
[laughter]
- It's her 16th birthday, and
her dad paid for everything,
but her stupid friends
won't text her back.
- Young lady, you better not be
sexting.
- Mom, you've ruined
everything!
- Next up, Jinkx Monsoon.
Oh, hippy girl.
<i>Almost Famous.</i>
- This is Pacific Northwest
stoner chick extravaganza look.
- Jinkx, I read your diary,
and we need to have a talk.
- My name's not Jinkx anymore.
It's Dreamcatcher.
[laughter]
- Up next, Roxxxy Andrews.
- Usher is performing
at my sweet 16.
- Oh!
- She got a marshmallow ring?
- Yeah!
- Where my peeps at?
- I'm loving every minute.
The judges are smiling.
I'm giving them 16-year-old
realness.
- She's 16 going on sickening.
[laughter]
Up next, Detox.
- She's a Pink Lady.
- Pink Ladies rule the school.
- Yeah.
- My sweet 16 look is
'80s-inspired.
I'm working this lollipop,
sexy sweet 16.
- Rizzo's P.G.
- Pass it on.
- [laughs]
- Category is Sugar Mama,
executive realness.
Alaska.
- Cougar lady.
- Yes.
She's serving Barbara Corcoran.
[laughter]
- This woman takes her job
very seriously.
She's coming to visit
the construction site,
and, by god, there better not be
any bullshit.
- Tear down that bitch of
a bearing wall.
[laughter]
Jinkx Monsoon.
Darling, it's Lacroix, darling.
It's Lacroix.
[laughter]
- I am just camping it
down the runway
with every utensil I could find
stuck in my little French twist.
- She does give good
headmistress.
Roxxxy Andrews.
- Pork bellies?
Sell! Buy! No!
- Tina Knowles, I'm not buying
your line.
- Yes.
[laughter]
- I'm in my little short velvet
dress with my gummy bears,
and I am feeling sickening.
C-E-oh-no-she-didn't.
- Up next, Detox.
Serving Mugler.
- Oh, yeah.
- No lady is ever sure
at night.
- That's right.
- I've Angel perfume and
my Thierry Mugler bag.
Take that and suck on it.
- Love that blazer.
It's a real power top.
- [cackles]
Kind of like me!
- [laughs]
Category is Candy Couture,
edible eleganza.
First up, Alaska.
I think the material is
a cotton candy blend.
- I was having
some serious issues
with this cotton candy
fantasy.
So I'm feeling beautiful and
right,
but please, candy couture,
don't fall apart.
- Fluff the magic drag queen.
- Mmm.
- Jinkx Monsoon.
It's a hard candy Christmas.
- And her breath
is minty fresh.
I decided not to wear
that damn hoop skirt,
and I couldn't be more pleased
with the way it turned out.
I am the Abominable Snow Jinkx.
- Peppermint patty realness.
- This is a stag party.
[laughter]
- Roxxxy Andrews.
- Ooh.
- Wow, taste the rainbow.
- Bitches.
- Those judges cannot take this
coutureness.
Miss Thing, I know
my body looks right.
This licorice is exactly where
I need to be laying.
- Melts in your mouth.
- I wonder if her panties are
edible too.
- They are.
- Detox.
Very Splenda in the grass.
- My candy couture look,
it's Detox.
It's electric.
It still has a little touch
of the '80s.
- Lollipopulence.
- Yes.
- Is that some black licorice
I see?
- Uh-huh.
Licorice and lace.
Coming up...
Which one of you sweethearts
does not deserve to be
in the top three?
[dramatic music]
- [laughing]
Welcome, ladies.
Thanks to your candy couture,
I've got a cavity.
And it's throbbing.
Now it's time
for the judges' critiques.
First up, Alaska.
- Hi.
- Alaska, so<i> Sugar Babies</i><span style="bodyStyle"> was</i>
really cute.
I thought that it was
a little simple.
But your sweet 16, perfection.
- I see these girls all over
my part of Los Angeles. [laughs]
And I love how you committed
to the character.
- The cougar lady,
perfect in every way.
And the cotton candy is, to me,
the best representation of
candy.
I knew exactly what you were
when you walked out.
That's important.
- All right, next up
Jinkx Monsoon.
- The<i> Sugar Babies</i><span style="bodyStyle"> number,</i>
you really stood out,
'cause I did like your
googly-eye bit.
- Your sweet 16 party girl,
16 going on 47.
Like, she didn't feel young
at all.
- When I walked
into the werk room,
you had a big hoop skirt
that you had doctored and--
- Oh, yes.
I think it was a good choice
not to try to do too much
in one look.
- Jinkx, you break my heart.
I really want to see candy
glued to every piece of fabric
that you have on.
A hoop skirt
would have allowed you
to glue more candy onto
your outfit.
- Up next, Roxxxy Andrews.
- Your sweet 16 party girl,
I love that you did the edible
marshmallow jewelry,
although she was a really
promiscuous-looking 16-year-old.
- The executive look, I love.
You just looked like a bitch
on wheels.
I loved it.
- You reminded me of
<i>The Devil Wears Prada.</i>
And I love the candy couture
outfit.
You should make it for yourself
out of real fabric,
because you look great in it.
It's so flattering.
- Up next, Detox.
- I liked your sweet 16
'80s look--
your attitude, the jacket.
And the sugar mama executive
reminded me of, like,
Glenn Close in<i> Fatal Attraction.</i>
- Your candy couture, though...
girl, it's a stretch.
- It's unfortunate that there's
a disconnect
between buying something
off the rack
versus designing something for
yourself.
And it makes me question
your taste level.
- All right.
Thank you, Detox.
Ladies, I hate to end
on a sour patch,
but I have one
final question.
Which one of you sweethearts
does not deserve to be
in the top three and why?
Starting with Jinkx.
- The one who has fallen short
most often up here is Detox.
- Alaska, same question.
- I would say Jinkx Monsoon.
I absolutely love her, but
I feel like there's maturing
that I would like to see.
- Roxxxy Andrews?
- Jinkx Monsoon.
The challenges that she needed
to step outside of her box
and design and be creative,
she didn't do well.
I had to be funny where I had
to be funny.
And it when it landed me
in the bottom,
it landed me in the bottom.
- Detox?
- I do agree
with the other girls.
It's not really a school
for girls.
It's a competition for the best
of the best.
- All right.
Thank you, ladies.
I think we've heard enough.
Now, while you untuck in the
Interior Illusions Lounge,
the judges and I
will deliberate.
[engine starts]
All right.
Just between us "goils,"
what do you think?
Let's start with Alaska.
- Alaska really brought three
fully realized looks.
I liked her sweet 16 number.
- The only thing is, I would've
maybe have liked to have seen,
like, a light color dress.
Like, why black?
- It's the days of wearing
a lot of fluffy pink
doesn't exist anymore.
You know, they want to look like
a whore.
[laughter]
- What's wrong with that, Bob?
[laughter]
- The executive sugar mama,
she committed to who she was
bossing around.
I loved it.
- It could go really bad
for a man in drag
wearing a blazer
and a pair of slacks.
But the way she cut it in
at the waist,
the way she padded herself,
I bought it.
- I thought the candy costume
was the only one that really
said candy when she walked out.
And I think she knows how to use
those legs.
- She's bowlegged.
[laughter]
- Yeah, she is,
but, boy, from the crotch down,
she's a star.
[laughter]
- Detox.
- Her sweet 16 just left me,
like, "Ugh. Really?
I feel like you can do better
than that."
I'm not getting what I want
from her.
- The executive look,
what I liked most
about it was the crazy-ass hair
juxtaposed with that, like,
very sleek suit.
- She was very prepared with
the fashion that she brought.
But then when she is asked to do
something from scratch, like,
the taste level, like,
disappears.
- If they're gonna design
their own dress,
they have to know
how to work that dress.
She didn't work it at all.
She never did anything
except just stumble over it
and trip all over it.
- Roxxxy Andrews.
- Roxxxy was the only one
who brought candy
to each and every one
of her looks.
- The sugar mama executive,
I loved her attitude.
There was something--I kind of
liked that it was a short dress,
and she's kind of got, you know,
muscular thighs.
- Her candy couture was my
favorite of the night.
- But we didn't know
that was candy.
- But she worked it.
- When I was backstage
with her,
she had something completely
different,
something that looked like
a candy-coated Dorito.
- [laughs]
That sounds good.
- Yeah, it sounds delicious.
But I questioned it, and she
changed it, you know?
And that's the sign of someone
who is paying attention.
All right,
moving on to Jinkx Monsoon.
- I think she's a terrific
performer.
But as far as the candy couture
outfit goes,
it just didn't really work.
- If you can't tell that your
'70s-inspired look
isn't really doing
the sweet 16 thing,
I don't know when you're gonna
know that.
- She looked like Bette Davis
in<i> Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte.</i>
- [laughs]
- I mean, truly.
That long wig
and that weird lacy, ugly dress.
- Jinkx kind of failed
at every single one
of the things tonight,
although I did feel, really,
that she was getting thrown
under the bus by Rolodex here.
- Rolaskatox.
- Yeah. They're Rolodex.
I think they were like, "Oh,
let's get to the top three
together."
It was like season one
of<i> Survivor.</i>
- [laughs]
- Silence.
I've made my decision.
Bring back my girls.
[laughing]
Welcome back, ladies.
I've made some decisions.
Alaska, your candy couture gave
the judges a real sugar rush.
You are the winner
of this week's challenge.
- Ahh!
[applause]
- You've won a private portrait
session
with celebrity photographer
Austin Young.
- I'm in the top three.
I am so happy.
- Roxxxy Andrews, I'm gonna
keep this short...
and sweet.
You're safe.
Condragulations.
You've made it
to the final three.
You may step to the back of
the stage.
Detox, Jinkx Monsoon,
I'm sorry, my dears,
but you are up for elimination.
- It's more than I can even
process right now.
My body, it's all numb.
- I'm pissed off that I'm here.
It's devastating.
- Two queens stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me
and save yourself
from elimination.
The time has come for you to
lip-sync for your life.
- The lights go down, and
the last things I say to myself
are "I love you, Nana" and
"water off a duck's back."
- Good luck.
And don't fuck it up.
[upbeat music]
- [singing in Spanish]
- This is a perfect song for me
to play up a schtick.
Thank god I'm not wearing
that hoop skirt.
- I'm throwing in, like,
a little salsa twist here.
I'm being very sexy.
Gonna send that bitch packin'.
- I look over at Detox, and
she's doing her thing.
She's playing the opera singer.
She's doing her quirky little
lip-moving thing.
If I was Jinkx, I'd be worried.
- Jinkx is kicking and dancing,
and she's bumping her hips.
I hate to say it, but Detox
might be getting out-danced
by Jinkx.
- [singing in Spanish]
[laughter, applause]
- Ladies, I've made
my decision.
- Water off a duck's back.
Water off a duck's back.
Jinkx Monsoon,
shantay, you stay.
Detox, you had me hooked
from day one,
and I can't get you
out of my system.
And now
neither can anyone else.
Now sashay away.
- It's been so magical and
so humbling.
Thank you so much, from
the bottom of my heart.
- Thank you, Detox.
- I'm gonna miss
all of you guys.
I love you.
I love you so much.
- [yells]
It really fucking sucks
that I didn't all the way
to the top three,
like I had intended to.
A better fit
would've definitely been
to have me in the top three.
But I just can't thank Ru
enough.
The only thing I have left to
say is...I've had it.
Bye.
- The top three.
One final challenge stands
between you and $100,000.
Now remember,
if you can't love yourself,
how in the hell are you gonna
love somebody else?
Can I get an amen up in here?
all: Amen!
- [laughs] All right.
Now let the music play.
[RuPaul's<i> The Beginning]</i>


-<i> Previously on</i>
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race...</i>
- Alyssa has been
a distraction for me.
I've got to shake this off
and move on.
- You'll be debuting
an original drag ballet.
- I can't dance.
- Coco, you pick first.
- Alyssa Edwards.
- What the fuck?
- Here's what I want from you,
Jinkx.
I want to see some glamour.
- The winner is Alyssa Edwards.
- [exhales with relief]
- Honey Mahogany,
Vivienne Pinay,
I'm sending you both home.
Now, ladies, sashay away.
- Girl.
- After the double elimination,
every girl knows Ru is not
playing the radio.
- Girl.
- Crack.
That's a sign of don't get
too comfortable.
- That was the closest I ever
want to get to the bottom.
To be in the bottom three has
lit a fire under my ass.
Never again.
- I think everyone is just
shocked that Roxxxy Andrews
is in the bottom three.
But I'm not shocked.
She's part of Rolaskatox, and
they've convinced themselves
that they're invincible.
- But you won.
- I wish she would have sent
all y'all bitches home.
[laughter]
- I want you to go home too,
bitch, so you don't throw me
in the bottom again.
Alyssa wanted to act
like she's so real,
but I think it was a pretty
bitchy-ass move to call
me out onstage.
- The one that I would want to
send home is not in this lineup.
I don't see Jade
at the same level.
If she would've asked me who
needed to go,
I would have said that,
because from the view
that I was getting,
it looked like a sausage
squeezed into a two-piece.
It was not pretty.
- You can't take it personal.
- You're a dirty bitch.
- It's not dirty.
I kept it real to your face.
If I wanted to be dirty, I would
have really, really read you.
Ha.
- Well, girl, if you read me,
I would have read you
right back.
- That's a part of the game,
baby.
Welcome to drag.
I knew coming into this
competition that the claws
would come out.
I don't want to scratch
anybody's eyes out.
I just want to scratch my way
to the top.
'Cause I'm what?
Sickening.
-<i> The winner of RuPaul's Drag</i>

-<i> It's a new day</i>

And the more that are gone,
the better.

<i>They're made.</i>

- Uh-oh.
- Hello, hello, hello, ladies.
all: Hi.
- Well, well, well...
for today's mini challenge,
we're ripping a page
from<i> Us Weekly</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
to find out who wore it best.
And we're going to do it
<i>Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> style.</i>
Now, you'll have just 30 minutes
to turn these cuddlers...
- Ooh.
- Into something
red carpet worthy.
I'll decide who wore it best.
Ready, set, style.
[all shouting, laughing]
- Damn.
- How am I supposed to wear
something so goddamn ugly?
- It'll be like everything else
you wear.
- How dare you?
- Oh, really?
- All right, ladies.
Time's up.
[camera shutter clicking]
To help me make this sartorial
decision,
I've invited an expert.
From<i> Us Weekly</i><span style="bodyStyle"> magazine,</i>
please welcome senior editor
Ian Drew.
[all cheering]
- Uh, Ru?
Is that a Klein Epstein &amp; Parker
suit that you're wearing?
- Why, yes, it is.
What do you think?
- Well, I think, in this case,
Ru wore it best.
- Aw.
[laughter]
All right.
First up, wearing zebra,
Coco Montrese.
You want some Coco
in your Cocoa?
Next up, Ivy Winters.
Girls gone wild kingdom.
Detox.
She's pairing it with some
DayGlo.
[imitates camera shutter
clicking]
[laughter]
All right, Ian.
- Yes.
- Who wore it best?
- I'd have to say Detox.
- Ah, Detox.
- Yay.
- Next up, wearing giraffe,
Lineysha Sparx.
[imitates camera shutter
clicking]
Ooh, look at that manicure.
Roxxxy Andrews.
<i>Jet</i><span style="bodyStyle"> magazine, this way.</i>
- [laughs]
- [laughs]
Next up, Alaska.
Dear Lord.
African<i> Vogue,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> this way.</i>
- I think it was the best makeup
she's worn all season.
- So, Ian, who wore it best?
The name on everybody's lips has
got to be Roxxxy.
- Roxxxy Andrews.
First up wearing pink,
Alyssa Edwards.
Who are the jewels by?
- They're rented.
[laughter]
- A night at the opera.
Jade Jolie, a vision in pink.
- [laughs]
- Thank you, Jade Jolie.
Jinkx Monsoon.
Oh, my.
- The missing Olsen twin.
- Uh-huh.
- She just woke up.
- This way, Jinkx.
- I don't think Jinkx did
anything with the blanket.
She just put the blanket on
and gave it a character...
what she does best.
- All right, Ian.
So who wore it best?
- It is a stiff competition,
I will say.
- Oh.
- But it has to be
Alyssa Edwards.
- All right, Alyssa Edwards.
Well, condragulations
to our best dressed queens.
You've each won an<i> Us Weekly</i>
swag bag.
Now, Ian...
- Yes.
- I'm about to give you
a<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> exclusive.</i>
For this week's main challenge,
we're going to play...
wait for it, wait for it...
Snatch Game.
[all cheering]
- This is what I came here
to do.
- Time to break out your best
celebrity impersonations.
Be fabulous, be a star, and,
most importantly, be funny.
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.
- So what's everybody doing?
What you doing?
- You doing Katy?
- I'm doing Ke$ha.
- [laughs]
- Who are you doing, Alaska?
- Lady Bunny.
- Oh.
It's risky.
- And she just did Lady Bunny
in the last challenge.
- That's very risky.
- Who are you doing, Roxxxy?
- Tamar Braxton, honey.
- [laughs]
- Who?
- Tamar Braxton,
Toni Braxton's sister.
If you don't know her,
you're going to know her.
- Oh, is she coming to life
today?
- She coming to life tonight.
Tonight!
- This is something you should
be strong at, right?
- I'm hoping.
- What are you going to do?
- I'm going to do Little Edie
from<i> Grey Gardens.</i>
- Who--what?
- Little Edie from<i> </i>
<i>Grey Gardens.</i>
-<i> Grey Gardens?</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
Who is that?
- Who is it?
- So Jackie O. has this cousin
and this aunt
who went bankrupt
and became shut-ins,
living in a big,
dilapidated mansion.
Little Edie had alopecia and
lost all her hair out of the
stress,
and then she became a big
fashion icon
years after she died.
- Do you think a lot of people
are going to recognize
that character?
- Little Edie is a risky
character.
Not everyone's going to know
who she is.
But I think people should know
who she is.
Here's your pate, mother,
darling.
At least, I think it's pate.
The label's faded.
[both speaking Spanish]
- When you're dealing with
people judging what you do,
you just have to let it roll off
like water off a duck's back.
All right.
-<i> Coming up...</i>
Who are you doing?
- Michelle Obama.
- Michelle Obama?
Okay.
- This about to get real ugly.
- Girl, look how orange you
fucking look.
- I'm not joking, bitch.
- [laughs]
[laughs]
- Our main challenge today is
to pick a celebrity character
and play them on
The Snatch Game.
- Freaking out.
- Are you scared you can't make
Ke$ha funny?
- I think I can make her funny.
- Snatch Game challenges your
improv skills, your wit,
and your impersonation skills.
Without these three things, a
drag queen might as well not
call herself a drag queen.
- Hello, hello, hello.
all: Hi.
- Ivy Winters.
- Hey, mama.
- Ah, who are you doing?
- Miss Monroe.
- Marilyn Monroe?
- Yes.
- How are you going to make
Marilyn Monroe funny?
- That's a good question.
[laughs]
Um, I think it's just relating
a lot to her movies.
Um...
- Yeah.
What about the funny part?
- I just have to be big
and blonde.
- Well, the tricky thing with
Marilyn, too,
is that she was
the smart dumb blonde.
So that sort of nuance
is not easy to do.
Get it going and make me laugh.
- I will.
- All right.
Alaska.
- Hi.
- 49th state.
- The biggest state.
- Oh, that's right.
It's like its own country.
- I'm my own continent.
- Oh.
- I'm incontinent, though.
- [laughs]
So who are you doing?
- I'm doing Lady Bunny.
- Ex-squeeze me?
Bunny is hilar--
I think she's actually the
funniest person I've ever met.
It's a tricky one.
I want you to be funnier
than Bunny.
- Okay.
- Okay?
- All right.
I'm scared shitless.
How the fuck am I supposed
to measure up to that?
- Hey, Coco.
- Hi, Ru.
- Now, okay, I'm getting
psychic feelings.
Um...
let me guess.
Margaret Thatcher?
- No, Ru.
Janet Jackson.
- I love me some Janet.
Now, what made you decide
to do Janet?
- I do Janet six nights a week
in Vegas.
- Really?
Six nights a week?
- Yes.
I really actually studied
everything about her onstage
and offstage.
So, if I don't know this
character,
then I shouldn't be doing drag.
- You got to bring the funny.
- Okay.
- All right.
Hi, Detox.
- Hi, Ru.
- I don't know who that could
be.
Let's see--Rachel Zoe
after a fire?
- No, I'm going to do my friend
Ke$ha.
- You're friends with Ke$ha?
- I've worked with her a few
times,
and I've done a bunch of her
music videos.
And, yeah, she's a lot of fun.
- Since you actually know Ke$ha,
how are you going to not sort of
hold back?
- I don't want to, like,
slander her too much.
- Well, that could be a problem.
You got to be willing
to make a fool
out of the person you're doing.
When the camera lands on you,
you have 30 seconds, from the
waist up, to make it happen.
Get back to work.
- Thank you.
- All right.
Hi, Jinkxy.
- Hi.
You caught me
with one eyebrow on.
- You are a quirky character.
I am just dying to find out...
who are you playing?
- Her name is
Little Edie Bouvier Beale.
- Jackie Kennedy's cousin.
- Yes.
- I love her.
But are you a little worried
that the audience at home
won't know who she is?
- It's a concern I had, but I
kept tossing around, you know,
pop icons I could do, and just--
none of them speak
to me the same way.
I landed on Little Edie because
I really relate to her,
and since I started in this
competition,
I feel even more connected
with her right now.
She's a little misunderstood.
- Yes, well, just make sure you
make Little Edie pop
for the unwashed masses.
- Mm-hmm.
- All right, well, listen,
you got a lot of work to do.
I'm going to let you get to it.
All right.
Lineysha Sparx.
- Hello, RuPaul.
- Who are you doing?
- I'm going to do
Michelle Obama.
- Michelle Obama?
- Yes.
- That's an interesting choice.
What made you decide to do
Michelle Obama?
- Because I think that I can
look like her, and--
- It's more than just looking
like the person.
They have to be funny.
Can I hear a little bit
of your Michelle Obama?
What did you serve Obama
for breakfast this morning?
- French fries.
- Um...
french fries.
Yeah.
Michelle Obama,
how are your daughters?
- [laughs]
Aw.
- Who are your other choices?
- I really--
I was thinking Celia Cruz.
- Is a good choice.
- But...
right now I got this choice.
I think it's better.
Celia Cruz--she's the queen of
the salsa,
but I really know that I can
look like Michelle Obama,
so I'm not going to change.
- It's a tough sell--
Michelle Obama.
Just be funny.
Be funny.
- I'm Michelle Obama,
and I approve this message.
- Ladies, gather round.
Now, I'll see you on the set,
with our extra special
guest judges...
MTV royalty Julie Brown
and Downtown Julie Brown.
[all cheering]
Don't fuck it up.
all: Bye, Ru.
- Julie Brown!
- Girl, which one do you think
I should do--Katy or her?
Miss Kim--this is not Kim.
This is too platinum.
I'm not 100% sold on Katy Perry.
I'm really thinking I should
probably switch to Kim from
<i>The Real Housewives of Atlanta.</i>
Celebrity impersonation is not
part of my gig,
and that makes me second-guess
myself
and what is the right character
for me.
- I have my makeup
like Michelle Obama.
I have my wig.
But I have in my mind the voice
of RuPaul.
- Do you know enough about
Michelle Obama to make it funny?
- Do you know enough about
Celia Cruz?
- Mm-mm.
My other option is Celia Cruz,
but I don't have the clothes.
I don't have the right wigs.
So...
I don't know.
- I'm worried about Lineysha
because I don't think she knows
what she's doing at this point.
She needs to get it together.
-<i> Coming up...</i>
Welcome to The New Snatch Game.
- Get your life.
- I don't have a single idea
who any of these people are.
[laughter]
- [laughs]
[laughs]
Welcome to The New Snatch Game.
Today it's a battle
of the Browns.
She put the "wubba" in
"wubba, wubba, wubba."
Downtown Julie Brown!
And she's, like, totally
the original valley girl--
Julie Brown.
May I call you
"Uptown Julie Brown"?
- I prefer "just say Julie."
- [laughs]
Now let's meet
our celebrity panel.
Direct from Grey Gardens,
it's Little Edie Beale.
- Oh, hi, RuPaul.
- How is Big Edie doing?
- She's always begging for the
pate, but the label is faded.
I can never tell if it's pate or
if it's giblets for the cats.
[laughter]
- Next, don't break up with her
because she'll write a song
about it.
It's Taylor Swift.
- I can't believe I'm here.
This is so exciting.
[giggles]
- Next, my old, old, old, old,
old friend, Lady Bunny.
- You know, the last time I had
a battle of the Browns was about
ten minutes ago
in my dressing room.
- [laughs]
- Hey, Ke$ha.
- I just woke up here.
- You're at The Snatch Game,
honey.
- What's that?
- Now it's the president of the
rhythm nation, Janet Jackson.
- Hi, Ru. How are you?
- What have you done for me
lately?
- I haven't put out a hit
in a while.
- Next, she's my teenage dream.
Hey, Katy Perry.
Oh, is that your fragrance?
- It is.
Would you like to try some?
- No.
- Okay.
- Good-bye, Norma Jean.
Hello, Marilyn Monroe.
- Hello, Ru.
- Now, is it true that gentlemen
prefer blondes?
- Oh, they do.
You know it.
- Fabulous.
Next up, it's the queen
of salsa, Celia Cruz.
<i>Hola!</i>
- I'm very fine here.
My English is
no very good-looking.
- Last but not least, it's
Braxton family bad girl...
Tamar Braxton.
- Get your life!
- What's Toni really like?
- Girl, who cares?
This is my first gig without
Toni, and I am so excited.
Boom!
[laughter]
- Okay, here's how the game
works.
I ask the question.
Our celebrity panel fills
in the blanks.
And you give an answer that you
think will match.
First question for Julie Brown.
Lady Bunny is so over politics.
When she steps into the voting
booth, she just blanks.
- Pleasures herself
with the voting wand.
- Let's hear what our
celebrities have to say.
- Little Edie?
- Well, I don't know her
personally,
but she looks older than mother
darling, so I said,
when she steps into the voting
booth, she just seizures.
Spelling?
- Seize--[laughs]
[laughter]
Not a match.
Moving on to Celia Cruz,
the queen of salsa.
Lady Bunny is so over politics.
When she steps into the voting
booth, she just...
- Flip her hair back and forth.
- I think it's "whip your hair
back and forth."
- Uh-huh.
-<i> Si.</i>
- Uh-huh,<i> si.</i>
- No el match-o.
- No match-o?
- No.
All right, we're going to the
original material girl,
Marilyn Monroe.
- She passes out.
I think if it was me, it'd be
the hard decision-making.
I get a little bit light-headed
sometimes.
- Now, you're into politics,
aren't you?
Presidents and...
- Ivy totally didn't get the
joke.
It was an awkward moment.
- Quite the scandal, actually.
[laughter]
With my cousin-in-law, really?
- [laughs] Yes.
- It was in all the magazines
at the time.
[laughter]
- All right, next question is
for Downtown Julie Brown.
- Yes.
- Heather the hoarder is such
a mess.
When she opens her blank, her
personal massager falls out.
- When she opens her box.
- Let's see if we get a match
from Taylor Swift.
When she opens her blank, her
personal massager falls out.
- Falls out of her Taylor Swift
lunchbox.
- Oh, that's a match!
She's got box!
All right, let's move on
to Katy Perry.
- Hi, Ru.
- Did you really kiss a girl?
Have you ever kissed a girl?
- [gasps] Ru, never.
- But--uh, yeah.
Have you ever fucked
a black guy?
[laughter]
Okay, okay.
Heather the hoarder
is such a mess.
When she opens her blank, her
personal massager falls out.
- Her clutch.
- Sorry.
Not a match.
- I think that immunity for
Alyssa is gonna come in real
handy this week.
- Lady Bunny, same question.
When she opens her blank, her
personal massager falls out.
- Well, Julie,
I just wrote "anus."
[laughter]
- Same neighborhood--
not a match.
[all awwing]
Next question is
for Julie Brown.
Lady Gaga has finally gone
too far.
She wore a dress made of blank.
- Madonna's leftovers.
- Madonna's leftovers!
Let's go to the stars.
Ke$ha, she wore a dress made
of blank.
- I said "her stupid monsters,"
'cause my animals
are fucking badass.
- Oh, right, that's what you
pop stars call your fans.
- Yeah.
- Let's move on to the queen
of salsa, Celia Cruz.
- Hey, hey.
- She wore a dress made
of blank.
"A can of tomato salsa."
- Like a big can.
- [imitates buzzing]
Flat.
- All right.
- [scatting]
- Tamar, Lady Gaga's finally
gone too far.
Last week she wore a dress made
of blank.
- Boom!
Who cares?
I'm so sick and tired of hearing
about that bitch.
[laughter]
Tamar's world.
- That's right.
Moving on--this one's for
Downtown Julie Brown.
Paula Deen is out of control.
This morning she put a stick
of butter on her blank.
- On her toothbrush.
- On her toothbrush!
- [laughs]
- Miss Janet Jackson.
- I think she put it
in her panty liner.
- Panty liner.
- I did too.
You want to see what happened?
- Yes.
Oh, my goodness.
Oh, my goodness!
- Oh, my God, it's so thin.
- That's impressive.
- Coco's voice as Janet
was so perfect.
But she wasn't able
to make it funny.
- Ru, may I ask you why you
couldn't have gotten me real
celebrities for this game?
- Well...
- I don't have a single idea
who any of these people are.
You could have gotten
Leslie Caron or Audrey Hepburn
or any one of them.
Instead you got ketchup.
- Ketchup?
- And that must be
Janice Jickson?
- Can I ask you a question, Ru?
- Yes, you can ask me
a question.
- What's a Little Edie?
- Little Edie is a star of
a movie,<i> Grey Gardens.</i>
- Okay, well,
she's not that little.
Who the hell is Little Edie?
I didn't know what that is.
- Okay, moving on--
[singsong] Tamar Braxton.
- Get your life!
- Now, Paula Deen
is out of control.
This morning she put a stick
of butter...
- On her--boom--Louboutins,
'cause her fat-ass feet
don't fit in 'em.
[laughter]
- I really have to pee.
[record scratches]
Can I pee?
- Just a--in just one second.
We're get--we're almost done.
- I'm gonna go ahead and pee
over here by Tamar.
- She's gonna go pee in the
corner.
- [laughing]
[liquid rushing]
Ke$ha!
- Do you have toilet paper?
- Yeah, I'll get somebody
to clean that up.
- Thanks, Ru.
- Detox bathroom break?
[mouthing] Gross.
- All right, I'm afraid we've
run out of time.
And the winner is...
who cares?
[laughter and applause]
Thanks for joining us, everyone.
Until next time, RuPaul out.
Say good night, stars!
both: Good night, stars.
-<i> Coming up...</i>
- I don't understand why you're
really trying to, like,
come for me.
- Girl, you came for me.
- It just came off as
"annoying skank."
- [laughs]
[laughs]
- Ro...
- Laska...
- Tox.
- It's elimination day, and
with a challenge
like The Snatch Game,
it's definitely a lot more
intense.
- Alyssa, are you glad you had
immunity?
[all oohing]
- I don't do characters.
I mean, this was going to be the
hardest challenge for me,
period.
- At this point, we know Snatch
Game is gonna happen.
- Right.
- You should already have a plan
from the moment you audition.
- America's Next Drag Superstar
is not going to travel the
country being a comedian.
She needs to be sickening.
Do the math.
Jinkx, on the runway, I think
you should've prepared more
than one look.
- Honey, all your outfits
haven't been that clean either.
What you wore--that gold the
other day--
some people shouldn't come down
to wear a two-piece,
because the view that I had in
the safe zone was not too cute.
- I don't understand why you're
trying to, like, come for me.
I mean--
- Girl, you came for me, right
out there,
threw me under the fuckin' bus.
- You're still mad about that,
girl?
I mean, are you intrigued
or something?
- No, honey--
- Obsess much?
- That's one thing I ain't.
One thing I'm not is intrigued.
- Jade, I can speak up
for myself.
Alyssa, every week I've done
a different look.
Like, one time I was space age.
The next time I was
Marie Antoinette.
- No, no, no, no, some people
are coming down the runway
in complete bullshit.
Had I pulled that on the runway,
they would have ripped me
to shreds, and y'all know it.
Jinkx--she's all comedy
and no glamour.
I don't think from day one,
she's put anything on the runway
worth looking at.
- I have dealt with this my
entire drag career, you know?
It's getting frustrating to have
to defend a style of drag
that's completely valid.
When I first got to Seattle,
because I'm kind of quirky,
not a lot of queens took me
very seriously.
- Girl, what if I just went out
there
and not even brushed its hair?
I'ma say, "Well, I was trying
to make it funny.
Everything got to be funny,
right?"
- [voice breaking] Every time
I step into something new,
I have to fight this fight
again.
I don't want to have to keep
explaining myself.
- Miss Coco, you're gonna have
to do a little bit more pink
in the eye.
- You concerned about what's
going on over here when
you need to be worried about
what's going over there with
that same makeup you've been
running on the runway
every single time.
- Girl, look how orange you
fucking look, girl.
- Don't start with me.
- You're used to being my
runner-up and being behind me.
Don't switch the game up now,
mama.
- Okay, now, miss Alyssa...
[others whooping]
- Now you pushed it.
- Miss Coco, you're taking it
personal.
I'm joking with you.
- Oh, now I'm not joking, bitch!
You gonna call me a runner-up?
- You ain't never won nothing.
By default, mama--
you take that picture
by default.
- No, I took that picture
'cause you couldn't do the job,
bitch.
- I got that moment, though.
- She got the crown
put on her head.
She got to feel the emotion
of that moment.
She took that away from me.
I'll be damned if I let her take
that away from me here...
not without a fight.
This about to get real ugly.
- You know what's ugly?
Poverty.
[laughter]
- The Jade!
- The Jade of it all.
-<i> And what?</i>
[light applause]
Welcome to the main stage
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
Michelle Visage,
are you ready to play?
- Always.
- Santino's in the house.
- You are looking snatchtacular
tonight, Ru.
- [laughs]
- Downtown Julie Brown,
do you feel lucky?
- Very lucky.
- And the hilarious Julie Brown.
Did you have fun yesterday?
- I had such a great time.
- Tonight the queens are
serving their own girlish
glamour on the runway.
Category is...
deadliest snatch.
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.
[electronic beeping]
<i>Commence shake down.</i>
First up, Ivy Winters.
Goldfish.
- It's little she-mo!
-<i> I'm strutting down the runway,</i>
<i>and I could feel my little fin</i>
<i>flopping.</i>
<i>I felt very fishy.</i>
- Now, that's a catch.
- But still very "koi."
[laughter]
Detox.
Ooh, she's a power pouf girl.
- Or a cupcake.
-<i> I'm serving killer jellyfish</i>
<i>realness,</i>
<i>and I'm living for it.</i>
- You know,
you could shoplift in that.
She could steal a ham.
- Jade Jolie.
Chain, chain, chain!
-<i> I'm serving up some bondage</i>
<i>bombshell fish fierceness,</i>
<i>and I am loving it.</i>
- She spent a lot at Home Depot
for that one.
- Yes.
- [laughs]
- Roxxxy Andrews.
It's like a blazer
and no trousers.
- Blazer!
-<i> Miss Thang, I am walking down</i>
<i>this runway like I am</i>
<i>$10 million.</i>
<i>Pose, pose, pose.</i>
- Roxxxy, your pussy is on fire.
- [laughs]
- Jinkx Monsoon,
chicken of the sea.
-<i> I am serving up Seattle boho</i>
<i>chic</i>
<i>with a flair of day out</i>
<i>at the beach.</i>
[giggles]
- She's like a flying fish.
- Brackish, actually.
- Now there are 102 ways
to wear a scarf.
[laughter]
Ooh, Coco, girl.
- All right, little Coco Minaj.
-<i> I am turning it out.</i>
<i>This is my runway.</i>
<i>Thank you, Ru, for letting me</i>
<i>borrow it.</i>
- Those boots are made
for stomping.
- Or wading through a river.
[laughter]
- Alyssa Edwards.
The little mermaid's
all grown up.
-<i> I am the definition</i>
<i>of fishy glamour.</i>
<i>Always and forever,</i>
<i>Alyssa Edwards.</i>
- Mm.
- What's her net worth?
- [laughs]
She has a date with Moby Dick.
- Lucky.
- Lineysha Sparx.
- That is Sheila E. realness.
- If a girl answers,
don't hang up.
-<i> I am serving bawdy,</i>
<i>bawdy, bawdy,</i>
<i>and just a little bit of bitch.</i>
- You know, she's got a leg up
on the competition.
- She does.
- The 49th state, Alaska.
- Something smells fishy.
-<i> I'm holding a brook trout</i>
<i>my grandfather</i>
<i>caught in Lake Erie.</i>
<i>Grandpa would be so proud</i>
<i>and completely horrified.</i>
- Would you like a mint?
- That outfit would go great
with some tartar sauce.
- Mmm.
-<i> Coming up...</i>
- It's rather pedestrian.
- I do think we have a slightly
different aesthetic.
- [laughs]
[laughs]
Welcome, ladies.
Based on your performances in
The Snatch Game
and your presentation
on the main stage,
I've made some decisions.
Jade Jolie...
Coco Montrese...
Alyssa Edwards...
Alyssa, this week you let down
Katy Perry.
I want you to tweet an apology
to her tonight--
#RuPaulogy.
- Yes, ma'am.
- But last week you won immunity
from elimination.
The three of you are safe.
- Katy Perry's fans
are gonna slay me.
It was an embarrassment
to my career.
- Ladies, survey says you
represent the best and the worst
of the week.
It's time for the judges'
critiques.
First up, Detox.
- The problem is, Ke$ha's not
really that much fun.
It has to be somebody
who's kind of fun.
I just don't want to hang
with Ke$ha.
- Tonight on the runway,
your side silhouette is huge...
like a ball with legs.
- The first thing I thought of
when I heard fishy fierceness
was a jellyfish.
- Really? That's the first thing
you thought of?
You're fiercer than that.
- Next up, Roxxxy Andrews.
- I thought you did
a wonderful job
with your portrayal of Tamar.
I had a lot of fun and giggles
with you.
- Tonight your boobs
look amazing.
I love a bedazzled muffin.
- The hair is interesting, but
I wish it was a little more
coiffed.
- Next up, the 49th state,
Alaska.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Your Lady Bunny, for me,
was absolutely hilarious.
You have incredible timing.
Absolutely fantastic.
- One thing that was kind of
missing from Bunny
was her voice.
She--it sounded more...
[deep, raspy voice] Like Roz,
you know, than it did--
[high-pitched voice]
Bunny's up here.
[high-pitched cackle]
- Next up, Ivy Winters.
- Your dress tonight I loved.
I mean, I loved the fun
and camp value
that we got with Nemo
eating you.
- [laughs]
- But with Marilyn Monroe,
you lost an icon.
What is the first thing
you think about?
[breathily]
You think about that.
[normal voice] You know...
- I think doing Marilyn Monroe
is next to impossible.
Everybody's done it.
You have to find something that
we haven't seen done to death,
in a way.
- Next up, Lineysha Sparx.
- You look absolutely stunning
tonight.
Love the hair and the choker and
the glam rock with the chains
going down.
- Celia Cruz was really generic.
- It's very hard make comedy
in other language.
It's more comfortable for me
make somebody Latino.
- I think you have the skills,
but you just didn't pull it out
of that character.
- All right, next up,
Jinkx Monsoon.
Michelle Visage?
- Jinkxy, I am starting to give
up here.
It's rather pedestrian.
I'm not getting glamour.
- To me, this looks glamorous.
I have big blonde hair--
- This, to me,
is not big blonde hair.
- I do think we have a slightly
different aesthetic.
[laughter]
- We do?
- You ruled The Snatch Game.
- [giggles]
- I thought it was absolutely
brilliant,
and I think anybody
who ever does The Snatch Game
should watch what you did.
- Thank you, Jinkx.
Well, ladies,
I think we've heard enough.
While you untuck in
the Interior Illusions Lounge,
the judges
and I will deliberate.
[engine turning]
All right, kids,
just between us girls...
what do you think?
Let's start with Detox.
- She looks like a blob,
and I was not happy tonight.
- I disagree.
I thought it was quite
a nice jellyfish.
- To me, it looked like two
giant shower caps--
not hot in any way.
- Did she make you laugh--
Detox?
- It just came off
as annoying skank.
- Roxxxy Andrews...
- Roxxxy nailed that modern take
on Liza with a "Z."
- As Tamar, Roxxxy rocked it.
- [laughs]
- [snaps fingers] Okay?
- Let's go way up north
to Alaska.
Santino, I thought that Alaska's
jokes were crude, rude,
offensive.
She nailed Bunny completely.
- Right on the head.
Yes, the voice was not there,
but she was consistent with her
own made-up voice for Bunny.
- I actually liked her little
fish wiggle on the runway, and,
uh, she's got the tiniest butt
I've ever seen.
- Ivy Winters.
- With someone like Marilyn
Monroe,
you really have to have
the voice down.
- I just don't know
why you'd pick Marilyn.
It seems crazy to me
that you'd pick it
if you can't do the voice
or the character.
- Lineysha Sparx.
- She's a sex shooter.
She's getting phone calls from
Prince right now
to get in his new girl group.
- Or get his outfit back.
- [laughing] Yeah.
But her Snatch Game was lost
in translation.
- It actually reminded me of my
grandma at Christmas with too
much eggnog with a karaoke mic.
- Jinkx Monsoon.
- She was like the Meryl Streep
of drag queens.
- 'Cause that bitch turned it
out.
- Completely committed.
Should be committed.
- [laughs]
- I was just wondering if we'll
ever be able to get to see that
ultra-glamazon thing
from Jinkx once.
Not that this is ugly.
She's adorable.
- Who Jinkx reminds me
of is Pandora Boxx.
- Yeah.
- I actually like that dress.
It was just the way
it was styled,
the way she paired the things,
and these are things you can
learn.
- She thought that was big hair.
[laughter]
- [claps]
Silence.
I've made my decision.
Bring back...
[sighs]
[whispering] My girls.
[laughs]
[laughs]
Welcome back, ladies.
I've made some decisions.
Roxxxy Andrews...
you're safe.
- Thank you.
- Jinkx Monsoon...
you gave us 50 shades
of<i> Grey Gardens.</i>
Condragulations, you are the
winner of this week's challenge.
[applause]
You've won a custom jewel
package from Fierce Drag Jewels.
- I won Snatch Game!
A life dream is coming true
today.
- Alaska...
you're safe.
- Thank you.
- Lineysha Sparx,
as the queen of salsa,
you lacked spice.
I'm sorry, my dear, but you are
up for elimination.
- To be in the bottom two
is very hard for myself.
But I don't want to go home.
- Ivy Winters,
your Marilyn Monroe was
one bland bombshell.
Detox, your Ke$ha was,
in a word...
blah, blah, blah.
Detox...
I'm sorry, my dear, but you
are up for elimination.
Ivy Winters, you are safe.
- Thank you.
- You may join the other girls.
Two queens stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me and save yourself
from elimination.
The time has come...
for you to lip-synch
for your life.
- I'm really well-known for
my unique style of lip-synch.
I'm ready to send
Lineysha packing.
- Good luck...
and don't fuck it up.
-<i> I feel sexy.</i>
<i>I feel powerful.</i>
<i>I feel strong.</i>
<i>I want to win this lip-synch.</i>
<i>I don't want to give it up.</i>
- Whoo!
-<i> I think Lineysha's heart is</i>
<i>really coming out,</i>
<i>and Detox is selling it.</i>
It's gonna be a close call.
[laughter]
- Whoo!
- [blabbering]
[cheers and applause]
- Ladies...
I've made my decision.
Detox...
shantay, you stay.
You may join the other girls.
Lineysha, your beauty transcends
language,
and there's no barrier
to how far you will soar.
Now sashay away.
[applause]
- [smooching]
- I love you,<i> mami.</i>
- This is the end for me
in this competition,
but I feel very proud to be one
of the family of<i> Drag Race.</i>
[speaking Spanish]
- Condragulations,
my crazy eight.
And remember, if you can't
love yourself,
how in the hell are you gonna
love somebody else?
Can I get an "amen" up in here?
all: Amen.
- All right, let the music play.


- Previously on<i> </i>
<i>Rupaul's Drag Race...</i>
You'll be creating kidster
television shows.
- I am ready
to toss your salad.
- I like a cheesy salad.
- Vivienne, if you can bring
your energy up to meet Roxxxy...
- You're gettin' lost.
- It was pure hell.
Fuck you, Alyssa.
- Coco is always the victim.
- You committed
the number-one crime.
You bored me.
- Detox, condragulations,
you are the winner
of this week's challenge.
Coco Montrese, shante, you stay.
Monica, sashay away.
- Monica Beverly Hillz.
- We're back in the workroom,
and Monica got sent home.
- I would have been incredibly
sad if Coco would have left.
I mean, she is my most closest
friend here.
I'm not going to be a yin yang
without my yin.
- So what was it like, girl?
- It taught me a big lesson
that, you know,
in this competition,
you have to focus
and concentrate
on what you're doing.
- Right.
- I haven't been focused.
In the whole competition,
Alyssa has been
a distraction for me.
I've got to shake this off
and move on.
- Vivienne, were you scared?
'Cause when you turned around,
Vivienne's face was like--
- I wanted to fucking throw up.
Are you kidding me?
I thought I was going to pull
a Willam.
I was so fucking scared.
You don't even know.
- Vivienne's critique
was basically
that she played little,
and I overshadowed her
in our scene.
She knows that she didn't shine
last week,
so she's got to shine
this week and pull through.
- At first, we were working
really well together,
and our script
was really good,
but once you get there...
At this point, I'm pissed.
I really felt like Roxxxy
overpowered me.
I think that she's
an attention whore.
- Oh, oh, my--ah!
Oh, my god.
- I personally think
that she's annoying.
I'm going to be honest.
I'd like to see Roxxxy go home.

- Another week.
[all speaking at once]
- It's a new week,
and I'm very excited
to find out what our new
challenge is,
because I have to prove
that I deserve to be here.
[siren wailing]
- Ooh.
- Oh, girl.
- You got shemail.
Hey, girls.
So you think you can dance?
'Cause America's next drag
superstar
needs to be one
singular sensation.
Girl, once you go<i> Black Swan,</i>
you never go back.
[cheers and applause]
Hey, hey, hey.
[cheers and applause]
What's happenin'?
[cheers and applause]
For today's mini challenge,
I want to turn back time
and find out
who are the best dancers
at<i> Rupaul's Drag Race.</i>
all: Oh.
- It is time to bust some
classic moves with
a good, old-fashioned<i> Soul Train</i>
dance-off.
[cheers and applause]
Ready, set, wig out.
- Oh.
- [laughs]
- This is going to be too much
fish for your nerves.
- Ooh, y'all don't want it.
- [laughs]
- All right, D.J., hit it.
[Rupaul's<i> Jealous of my Boogie]</i>
Coco Montrese.
- Yeah.
- Ooh.
Lineysha Sparx.
Burn, baby, burn.
Jade Jolie.
Hey.
- Whoo!
- Get it, girl.
Yeah.
Alaska.
Ooh, you a stone gas, honey.
- I'm featuring
the Flailing Chicken--
not really a Funky Chicken,
more like a chicken
that smells funky.
- Roxxxy Andrews.
[laughs]
- Ooh.
- Yeah.
[laughs]
Honey Mahogany.
Get it, girl, yeah.
- Ow!
- That's right.
Show them what you
are working with.
- Honey dances like
a white chick.
[laughs]
- Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
- Whoo!
- That was interesting.
- Detox.
That's right.
- Oh.
- Ooh.
[laughs]
She's a super freak.
Ooh!
Vivienne Pinay.
- Go, Viv.
Go, Viv.
- Hey, that's right.
Ivy Winters.
Make that money.
- Ivy doesn't have one stitch
of rhythm in that body.
This is not for you.
- Jinkx Monsoon.
Oh, my fur.
Hey.
Oh, get it, girl.
Whoo-hoo!
[laughs]
No parking on the dance floor.
Alyssa Edwards.
Yeah, shake your groove thing.
- Get it.
- Whoo.
Yeah, turn it up.
Ooh, you're giving those
Andrew Christian undies
a workout.
- Come on.
Ooh!
- Look at those
matching outfits.
- Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
[cheers and applause]
- All right, ladies.
The late, great Don Cornelius
would be proud,
but two of you
really brought the funk.
The winners are...
Jinkx Monsoon...
[cheers and applause]
And Coco Montrese.
[cheers and applause]
All right, ladies, for this
week's main challenge,
you'll be debuting
an original
American drag ballet.
- Yeah.
- It's called<i> No Rupaulogies.</i>
[laughter]
- Oh, my god.
- And it tracks the highs and
lows of my illustrious career.
Think of it as the black
<i>Swan Lake.</i>
Why it gotta be black?
[laughter]
- Hallelujah, thank the Ru gods
for sending a challenge my way
that I could excel in.
This is what I do.
I'm a dancer.
- Now, Jinkx and Coco,
you won the mini challenge,
so you're team captains.
All right, Coco, you pick first.
- Alyssa Edwards.
[record scratches]
- What the fuck?
- Well, well, well, I would
have never expected that.
- I'm not no dummy, y'all.
Alyssa is the best dancer,
and she's going to be
on my team.
- Hi, Jinkx.
You go next.
- Ivy Winters.
- [laughing]
- Detox.
- [laughs]
- Lineysha.
- Lineysha.
- Honey Mahogany.
- Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
- A-loose-ka.
- [laughs]
- Oh, wow.
All right, Coco.
- God, Jade is never going to
forgive me for this.
Roxxxy Andrews.
- Whoo.
- In the back of my mind,
I kind of felt that I would be
one of the first people
that she would choose.
It kind of was like a slap
to my face,
because we have been so close.
- All right, now, Vivienne
and Jade remain.
Jinkx, who do you pick?
- Jade Jolie.
- Jade Jolie goes to
Jinkx's team,
which leaves
Vivienne Pinay to Coco's team.
- Great.
I find myself again in a team
with a bunch of loudmouths.
- Now, remember, this week...
actions speak louder than words.
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.
- All right, I would like to
read through the script
before we assign any parts.
I feel a ton of pressure being
team captain,
but I kind of
built myself up last week,
and I don't want to take
a step backwards.
All right, I'm thinking young Ru
and Diana Ross.
Then we have Lady Bunny
and gender fuck drag Ru.
- Yeah.
- Does everyone feel good
about this?
- I feel awesome about it.
- Okay.
- I've worked with
Lady Bunny before.
I've made a couple costumes
for her,
and I've gotten to know her
pretty well.
- Ru's mom, you're going to be
the comic relief
right from the get-go.
- I'm the first impression
in this ballet,
and I can't dance.
- Have you had
any formal dance training?
- [mumbles]
- [laughs]
- Can you krump dance, though?
- No, what is that?
- You know, the--
I know you can do that.
- This is--that's my
only dance move.
It's going to be a problem.
- Coming up...
- We'll make you big.
- But we can't make her
outshine Ru though, right?
- Trust me.
She ain't gonna outshine me.
- Oh. Oh.
- Fuck.
- [laughs]
- [laughs]
- Today, our main challenge
is<i> No Rupaulogies,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> the ballet,</i>
which is the story
of Rupaul's life.
I picked Alyssa for my team.
This could go
really, really good,
or this could go way south.
- In the first scene, there's
a good Ru and a bad Ru,
so there are two Ru's.
- I think it will be good
if we played the good Ru
and the bad Ru.
Ru versus Ru.
- Oh.
Oh, I see where this is going.
- Scene three is
"All my legendary children,
Ru and
America's next drag."
You gonna do Ru?
- I guess.
That's fine.
I think Vivienne should be
America's next drag superstar.
- Okay, that's fine.
- Once again, I'm in a team
with Roxxxy Andrews.
I don't like being
paired with her.
I just don't.
I don't like her energy.
- We'll put big earrings
on you.
Jewels, jewels, jewels,
and just the dress
and the shoes and the--
we'll make you big.
- But we can't make her
outshine Ru, though, right?
- Trust me.
She ain't gonna outshine me.
- Oh. Oh.
- I feel like the team today is
really underestimating me.
I'm kind of just waiting for it
to blow.
- Hello, hello, hello, hello,
my private dancers.
all: Hello.
- Is everything beautiful
at the drag ballet?
all: yeah.
- Of course.
- I don't believe you.
[all laughing]
Team Jinkx, who have you
assigned the roles to?
- Well, we have Ivy
as the Lady Bunny.
We have Alaska
as Mama Ernestine.
- [laughs]
- I'm your mama.
- Yes, you are.
- And we have Jade
as little Ru.
I am playing gender fuck
21-year-old Ru.
- Oh, dear.
- Yes.
- And who is playing
'60s Diana Ross?
- That would be Miss Lineysha
here.
- Are you familiar with
Diana Ross and the Supremes?
- Um, not really, no.
- All right.
Now, Ivy, you have
history with Lady Bunny.
- I do.
- I've always wanted to know.
I know you make costumes
for her.
- Uh-huh.
- What is Lady Bunny's
real waist size?
- She's a 28.
[laughs]
- Ooh, you mean her thigh
is a 28.
[all laughing]
- Now, Ernestine is Alaska.
Where are you drawing
inspiration?
- Well, in the voiceover,
it's going to say that she had
a mouth like a sailor, so...
- Yes, she did.
Her favorite saying was...
"You pussy-mouthed
motherfucker.”
- [laughs]
- I'm going to attempt to
convey
with my flailing limbs
Ernestine's strictness,
her strength,
and a face that's like this.
- All right, kids.
I'm going to let you get back
to rehearsal.
Good luck.
all: Thank you.
- Hey, team Coco.
- Hi, Ru.
- How you doing?
Now, which Rupaul
are you playing?
- I am the good Ru,
and alyssa's the bad Ru.
- [laughs]
Now, is this a case
of life imitating art?
- Yeah.
- How did that come about?
'Cause I was pretty gobsmacked
when you chose Alyssa.
I thought that you guys
had a little thing.
- Well, this is a competition,
and like I said,
I'm playing to win.
- Now, who's playing
'90s supermodel Ru?
- Me.
- The glamazon.
I love it, and you're working
with '90s Diana Ross.
Have you ever done
Diana Ross before?
- I've been asked
and actually haven't--
I wasn't able to the one time
they asked me to do it, so...
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.
- Now, Roxxxy,
you are today's Rupaul,
and you're working with
America's next drag superstar,
which would be Vivienne Pinay.
- She's just playing her
for the sketch.
She's not America's
next drag superstar.
[laughs]
- Yeah.
- Now, Vivienne,
you have been criticized
for playing it safe,
playing it small.
- Yes.
- How are you going to
overcome that?
- I, again, have a lot of
big personalities
in my--in my group.
- You absolutely do.
- After last week, I just have
to, fuck it, just be myself.
If people don't like it,
they don't like it.
- Vivienne has to step it up.
- Break a leg.
- I mean, Ru gave her
a warning last week.
I don't think he'll give her
another one.
- Gather around,
my sugar plum fairies.
Now, in a moment,
you'll be working
with two red hot
choreographers.
From Shaping Sound, Travis Wall
and Nick Lazzarini.
[clapping]
And tomorrow on the main stage,
you'll be making
your dance debut
in front of Travis and our
other extra special guest judge,
Chaz Bono.
all: Oh.
[cheering]
- Chaz.
I live for Chaz Bono.
Chaz Bono came out of
Cher's vagina.
- And opera ballet.
Come dressed in your most
diva-licious outfit.
Ladies, this production of
<i>No Rupaulogies</i>
could change the face of
contemporary dance forever.
So don't fuck it up.
- All right.
[classical piano music]
- Wow.
We don't have to do that, do we?
- Hey, ladies.
- Hi.
- I'm Travis.
- I'm Nick.
- Both the choreographers
are very dreamy,
and we're in
solitary confinement right now,
and all the girls
are like cats in heat,
to be quite honest.
- We kind of want to see
what we're working with here,
so if you could, one at a time,
show me your best move.
- So I have a little bit of
this in me.
- Okay.
- Oh, gorgeous.
- So--and these.
- [laughs]
- Oh, we love a split.
- That was beautiful.
- Wow, fouettes
are very advanced.
- [laughs]
- Oh, black swan.
- Fuck.
- This one.
[scatting<i> Macarena]</i>
- Macarena.
- So you're going to
take your legs out,
and you're going to go
jump that way.
- Um...
- Jump off the right foot.
Right foot.
Almost.
And chaine out and turn around
and kiss her.
- Ah.
- A little bit more grander.
Remember, you're playing
Diana Ross.
- I'm playing the role
of Diana Ross,
and I know how to do it.
- You know who Diana Ross is?
- Lineysha's going to bomb
at this.
- All right, take your foot--
you ready for floor?
You're going to jump right,
left, right, right, back.
Back, back, back.
- That's tricky.
- Nick and Travis,
they were, like,
shooting this choreography
on me super fast.
I'm just trying to remember it.
It was so overwhelming.
- This one's really important
for timing,
so you guys have
a lot of work to do.
- If we miss a beat,
it throws off
the whole rest of the piece.
It's going to be a nightmare
if we can't get this perfect.
- Coming up...
- And jump, go.
- They're, like, hesitant.
They're just not willing to
trust each other.
- [squeals]
- Honey kind of sucks.
Watching her
was so uncomfortable.
Fuck my life.
- [laughs]
[laughs]
- Stretch and extend
all the way over.
Stretch that side.
Today's main challenge is,
we have to tell Rupaul's story
through the art of dance.
This is a very important
challenge to me,
because I own
and operate a dance studio.
Good, and straighten.
And fingers crossed
that everything
just falls into place.
Oh, here we go.
Here we go, they're coming.
One, two, three, four, second,
five, down, seven, up, eight,
back, one, two, three, four.
- The looks on their faces
were, like, "uh-oh."
- Oh, that's real fancy, girls.
And I about shit my pants.
- Bye, kids.
- Bye, guys.
- Psych!
And it worked.
all: Hi.
- Hey, ladies.
How are you guys?
- Good, how are you?
- Are you guys ready
to dance today?
- For sure.
- All right, so let's start
with scene number one.
- Ooh, good Ru, evil Ru.
This one's going to be good.
- After not speaking to Coco
for two years,
and the blow up last week,
and then being picked
for his team today,
I'm hoping that our chemistry
can be there
and we can really deliver.
- I think you should definitely
do the lift.
This is about
trusting each other.
Can you just take her around
this way?
And turn me and go, lift,
like, that way?
- Oof.
- Slide and jump, go.
Jump.
- Ah.
[squeals]
Owie.
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Owie.
- Wait.
I feel like they're,
like, hesitant
'cause they're just not
willing to trust each other yet.
They definitely have the most
work cut out for them.
You'd run around her,
you grab her by the throat,
and then you
just let her go.
Go around, go around, go around,
go around, go around.
And then grab him by the throat.
You grab.
Mm, shake, shake, shake, shake.
- It felt so good.
- Grab her hands.
So you'll do six of these.
One, two, three, four, five,
six, passe, and right, left,
right, left, right, left, passe,
and--
- Travis decides to give us
some choreography
that's actually
a little complicated.
- Go.
Right, left.
- Down, down.
- Wait, you're holding wrong.
It's just six steps,
so as much as you can,
try to retain the choreography
just a little faster.
- Okay.
- Honey kind of sucks.
Watching her was
so uncomfortable.
Fuck my life.
- Next.
- What do you want, like--
- [laughs]
- Ooh.
- Wow.
- That's what I do.
- Roxxxy wants all the eyes
on her,
and I'm really waiting
for the moment
where she kind of
messes up,
even though she's
still in my group.
- Cue music.
Jump, jump.
Turn around, and jump.
- Shit.
- Jump.
Go over and around.
Turn, turn.
All right, cool, thank you.
- It's--yeah, it's getting--
yeah.
Roxxxy and Vivienne,
they're probably the weakest
dancers in that group,
so to have them
at the end
makes me a little bit nervous.
Remember, this is about
Ru's life.
Don't fuck it up.
[hip-hop music]
- Ro.
- 'Laska.
- Tox.
- Rolaskatox, darling.
- So tonight,
the first time we have
a major performance
right on stage
in front of Rupaul
and the judges.
- Show me one of your steps,
Alaska.
I've been waiting to see.
- Um, it's like this.
It goes...
[trills]
- That's beautiful.
- We're all shitting our pants
a little bit.
Or a lot, in my case.
- You know, when I came back
from college,
my parents actually found
a picture of me in drag.
- Oh, my--oh.
- Like, that's
how they found out.
They basically sent me out of
the country,
'cause they were like,
"You need to get away
from your negative influences.”
- Oh, my God.
- They sent you away basically.
- They sent me to Africa.
Yeah.
I think being a gay person--
we go through things
that I think enable us
to grow in a way
that straight people
don't get to have
that experience.
- I just wish my dad
would have been
a little bit more supportive
of the whole dancing.
When you do something
that makes you so happy,
and other people
try to take your happiness,
it's sad.
We just didn't have
that father-son relationship.
It was very hard for him
to understand me.
I found myself
getting lost in music,
and that's when it sparked me
to become a choreographer.
- I think everything
that we've all gone through
has made us--
- Oh, every road.
- Absolutely.
- And for me to give back
what was given to me,
the gift of
dance and art--it's my world.
- I feel really bad about Jade.
Not picking her right away.
Oh, she didn't even--
she just walked by me
like I wasn't even here.
She's really funny with me
right now.
I got to talk to Jade.
I've been trying to talk to you
all day,
and you've just been
avoiding me.
- Girl, I'm just focused on
my challenge and being here,
just like you're focused
on being here.
My feelings were hurt that Coco
didn't pick me.
Maybe she thought that I wasn't
a strong enough player
as the other girls.
I'm very happy that you picked
the team that you wanted,
and I'm very happy with the team
that I got.
So everything worked out.
Being in the bottom two
every week
just seems to work out for me.
- Oh, girl, I don't need
this today.
I need to get ready.
- Alyssa's most known
for her faces that she makes
in the mirror.
- The weird faces,
that's my favorite part.
- Playing
the ugliest face game?
- Yeah.
- So that's what you do on
the runway, Alyssa?
all: Ooh!
- [laughs]
Just pull it all in.
- [laughs]
[Rupaul's<i> Cover Girl</i>
<i>(Put the Bass in Your Walk)</i>
- Ooh.
- Welcome to the main stage of
<i>Rupaul's Drag Race.</i>
Michelle Visage,
may I have this dance?
- For the rest of your life.
- [laughs]
Santino Rice, how about some
dirty dancin'?
- Nobody puts baby Ru
in a corner.
- Ever!
- [laughs]
- And now, a man
with all the right moves,
Travis Wall.
How did my dolls do?
- They were absolutely fabulous
this week.
- Chaz Bono, welcome.
- Thank you, Ru.
- Tonight, we are dancing with
the drag stars.
- Can't wait.
- [laughs]
This week, our queens
were challenged
to dance their padded asses off
in an original drag ballet,
<i>No Rupaulogies:</i>
<i>An American Dance Odyssey,</i>
based on my life.
Or, as I like to call it,
the greatest story ever told.
[laughter]
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.
Coming up...
- Talk about not delivering.
- I just feel like
it's forgettable.
- The "it" thing
that you've got,
I didn't see up on the stage.
- [laughs]
[laughs]
[triumphant classical music]
- Act one of<i> No Rupaulogies,</i>
starring team Jinkx Monsoon.
[Vivaldi's<i> spring]</i>
<i>I was born a poor black child.</i>
[baby crying]
<i>My mama, Ernestine,</i>
<i>swore like a truck driver.</i>
<i>"His name is</i>
<i>Rupaul Andre Charles,</i>
<i>and he's gonna be a star,</i>
<i>'cause ain't another</i>
<i>motherfucker alive</i>
<i>with a name like that."</i>
<i>And damn it, maybe, just maybe,</i>
<i>mama was right.</i>
<i>I loved playing dress up</i>
<i>as a kid.</i>
<i>Then, one day,</i>
<i>I saw The Supremes on</i>
<i>The Ed Sullivan Show.</i>
<i>My eye went straight to</i>
<i>the girl in the middle.</i>
<i>I couldn't stop watching her.</i>
<i>She was my idol,</i>
<i>and I've been singing</i>
<i>Diana Ross songs</i>
<i>in the mirror ever since.</i>
<i>[William Tell Overture</i><span style="bodyStyle"> playing]</i>
<i>At 21, my pal,</i>

<i>Well, at least</i>
<i>the lower east side.</i>
<i>And we partied</i>
<i>like there was no tomorrow,</i>
<i>and there almost wasn't.</i>
- [laughs]
- [laughs]
[laughter and applause]
- The next team better not
slip on
all that pee on the stage,
because we pissed
all over this competition.
[Tchaikovsky's<i> Swan Theme]</i>
- Act two of<i> No Rupaulogies,</i>
starring team Coco Montrese.
I can't wait to see
how this turns out.
[Beethoven's<i> Symphony #5]</i>
<i>Super stardom was so close</i>
<i>I could taste it,</i>

Ah.

Brava.

<i>and, honey,</i>
<i>I wasn't going anywhere.</i>
[applause]
- Honey was just kind of dead,
and I was carrying around
some extra blubber.
- All my dreams have come true,
<i>so I've decided to spread</i>
<i>the love,</i>
<i>and to find America's</i>
<i>next drag superstar.</i>
<i>The charisma,</i>

- Brava.
Brava!
Coming up...
Who do you think deserves
to go home tonight and why?
[laughs]
[laughs]
[Rupaul's<i> I Bring the Beat]</i>
- Alaska!
Jade Jolie.
Lineysha Sparx.
Jinkx Monsoon.
Ivy Winters.
Alyssa Edwards.
Coco Montrese.
Detox!
Honey Mahogany.
Vivienne Pinay.
Roxxxy Andrews.
Welcome back, ladies.
This week, you worked in groups,
but tonight, you'll be judged
as individuals.
Jinkx Monsoon.
Ivy Winters.
Alyssa Edwards.
Vivienne Pinay.
Roxxxy Andrews.
Honey Mahogany.
The rest of you are safe.
You may leave the stage.
Ladies, it's time for
the judges' critiques.
First up, Jinkx Monsoon.
- I'm not crazy about the hair
and makeup.
It's not my favorite.
What's on your head?
- It is just a little, um,
head piece.
- I know you are filled
with lots of characters,
but I want to see some glamour.
I want to know if you've got
that in you.
- I believed in
all the debauchery
that you were creating up there
on stage
as young 21-year-old Ru.
- You were so entertaining,
and it was so much fun.
I really had a great time
watching you dance.
- All right, next up,
Ivy Winters.
- I love this outfit.
I'm a big<i> Victor/Victoria</i><span style="bodyStyle"> fan,</i>
so I think that this is great.
- You make everything
that you wear.
- I do, yeah.
- You're mind-blowingly
talented.
- Thank you.
- And your Lady Bunny
was so much fun.
- If anything,
your Lady Bunny was maybe
a little too skinny
and too pretty.
all: Ooh.
- That's a read!
- [laughs]
- Ooh!
- All right, next up,
Roxxxy Andrews.
- This look tonight--
there is something
not quite right
in the waist and hips area.
I don't think it's as flattering
as it could be.
You're not as curvy this week.
- I certainly know
what it's like
to not be the lightest
on one's feet.
You have to kind of
make up for it
with attitude and everything,
and I thought that's where
you could have elevated
your performance.
- Next up, Vivienne Pinay.
- Hi, Ru.
- Tonight, you faded into
the woodwork again.
It's a tad pedestrian.
- Look around
at your competition
and what they're wearing.
This is really low-key.
- I think you're actually one
of the most
beautiful queens
I've ever seen in person.
I think--
- Hey, wait, hold up a minute.
[laughter]
- I go back to thinking about
your performance
and, just, I feel like
it's forgettable.
- Next up, Honey Mahogany.
- You look like you must have
a lovely body.
This is just covering it up
and not doing anything for you.
- What is with you
and the kaftan collection?
Why don't we get to see
your figure?
And we need to talk about
your Diana Ross.
- I--you know, I've never done
Diana before.
- Clearly.
- [laughs]
- Alyssa Edwards.
- Tonight is ri-donk-culous,
and I've not seen a queen grand
jete across the stage before.
Fierce.
- You embodied everything
of the evil Ru,
and I don't think
the evil Ru lost.
- No.
And it didn't lose.
- Hello.
- If you walk into every
challenge this confident
as you were with this challenge,
I think you'll go a very long
way in this competition.
- Ladies, one last question
before you go.
At this point, you're all
getting to know each other.
Who do you think deserves to go
home tonight and why?
[thunder]
Jinkx Monsoon.
- Vivienne,
only because it seems like
she's repeating the same notes
that you guys are giving her.
- Ivy, what about you?
- I would have to say Honey.
- Roxxxy?
- Vivienne.
- Vivienne?
- I would say Honey.
- Honey?
- I would say Vivienne.
- Alyssa?
- The one that I would want
to send home
is not in this lineup.
- Who is not in the lineup
that you want to send home?
- Charisma, uniqueness, nerve,
and talent--
um, I don't see Jade
at the same level.
She's kind of a little
hokey pokey.
This is a drag queen
competition.
- Well, my queens,
I think we have heard enough.
While you untuck in
the Interior Illusions lounge,
the judges and I
will deliberate.
All righty.
Just between us dancers...
[laughter]
Let's talk.
What do you think?
Starting with Jinkx Monsoon.
- I do want to see other sides
to Jinkx
that I don't think
we've gotten to yet.
- If she can pull off
the glamazon,
we've got a real contender
on our hands.
- Her dancing wasn't
phenomenal,
but I think she
really made up for that
with committing
to her character.
- Ivy Winters.
- Nobody's more in on the joke
than Bunny,
and Ivy really
played that well.
- Did Lady Bunny ever lift you
up like that, Ru?
- Usually I saw her going down.
[laughter]
Roxxxy Andrews.
- She's out there playing you.
Honest to God, it's been so long
since I've seen you go out
in a leotard.
- She had a tall order
to play you now,
and the "it" thing
that you've got,
I didn't see up on the stage.
- All right, up next
is Honey Mahogany.
Now, here she is, playing
my idol, Diana Ross.
- I found myself watching
Detox the whole time.
- Tonight,
she comes up here again
with a sequin kaftan,
and this, you know, hodge podge.
It was all just whatever.
- Alyssa Edwards,
who is a trained dancer.
Regardless of her technique
and her background as a dancer,
she had the story in her head,
and we could see that.
- I mean,
she just looked so hot,
and I love her walk.
- She danced from head to toe,
between her hands and her toes.
Everything, she articulated
through her entire body,
and it was amazing.
- All right, moving on to
Vivienne Pinay.
- Talk about not delivering.
Even being the crowned drag
superstar--
No, you weren't.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
- You were just a regular girl
putting a crown on at the mall.
- Silence!
I've made my decision.
Bring back my girls.
[laughs]
[laughs]
- Welcome back, ladies.
This week,
you were all dance troupers,
but one of you stood out
as the prima drag ballerina.
The winner of this week's
main challenge is...
Alyssa Edwards.
[all applauding]
You've won a custom feather
piece from Mother Plucker,
and you'll receive immunity
from elimination next week.
- I'm at a loss for words,
and that doesn't happen much.
I'm just very thankful.
- Ivy Winters...
you're safe.
- Thank you all.
- Jinkx Monsoon.
You're safe.
- Thank you.
- Honey Mahogany,
as Diana Ross,
we were not swept away.
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you're up for elimination.
Roxxxy Andrews, we challenged
you to step it up,
and you fell short.
Vivienne Pinay,
you are making progress,
but this week,
it was not measured
in leaps and bounds.
Roxxxy Andrews...
you are safe.
- Thank you.
I'm so sorry.
- You may join the other girls.
- Vivienne Pinay,
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
Two queens stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me
and save yourself
from elimination.
The time has come.
You need to lip sync
for your life.
- The anger that I have
is preventing me
from being nervous.
Fuck it.
I'm going to do it
to the best of my ability,
because I owe it to myself.
- Good luck,
and don't fuck it up.
- I can sing live,
and I'm really able
to deliver a lip sync.
This competition is mine.
- I'm really trying to look
the judges right in the eye,
and give them a reason
to keep me here.
- They're both lacking energy.
It's Britney Spears.
Bring it.
[clapping]
- Ladies,
I've made my decision.
Honey Mahogany.
Vivienne Pinay.
I'm sending you both home.
I'm sorry, my dears.
Neither one of you showed me
the fire it takes to stay.
- In the history
of<i> Rupaul's Drag Race,</i>
there has never been
a double elimination.
- Double elimination?
Of course, it is.
Why wouldn't it be?
- Now, ladies, sashay away.
- I do have talent,
and I do have,
I think, what it takes
to be a performer.
If I could do something
differently,
I would have not worn
this kaftan.
Maybe I just need to
hire a stylist.
- I'm upset, obviously,
because I want to be here
to the end,
but I am beautiful,
and nobody can
take that away from me.
I will always be
the fishiest queen.
Today, tomorrow, next month,
the past seasons,
and the next seasons to come.
- Ladies, from here on out,
I will not tolerate
no half stepping.
Bring me your best.
Now, remember,
if you can't love yourself,
how in the hell you gonna
love somebody else?
Can I get a amen up in here?
all: Amen.
- [laughs]
Now, let the music play.
[Rupaul's<i> The Beginning]</i>


- Previously,
on<i> RuPaul's Drag Race...</i>
you'll be starring in two soaps.
Telenovela style.
- Son of a bitch.
It's another acting challenge.
- I have to reform Relaskatox.
- I don't want the judges to
see me relying on a clique.
- Chimichanga!
- [gasps] Oh!
Ay! Ay! Si! Si! Si!
Oy! Oy!
- Alyssa, you need to at least
match what Jinkx is doing.
- That dress is the worst dress
I've ever seen in five seasons.
- When you go to the clubs,
you don't ask the girls,
"Did you sew that,
did you make that?"
I am an entertainer.
- Alyssa,
that's not what this is about.
- Jinkx Monsoon, you're the
winner of this week's challenge.
[applause]
Coco Montrese,
shante, you stay.
Alyssa Edwards, sashay away.
- Girl...
- Agh!
Going into the workroom,
it really was a sweet moment
to see Alyssa leave the stage.
- "The sky is the limit
when your heart's in it."
- How do you feel?
- I feel free.
I feel a weight
lifted off of me.
- Are you making another
fat joke about her?
- Oh! Miss Jinkx!
- I'm happy that this book
is closed.
- Coco believes
that this has closed
a big chapter in her life.
So the hope now
is that she doesn't take
all of that Alyssa aggression
and put it on one of us.
- Now it's time to be
America's next drag superstar.
Thank you, girls.
all: Ooh...
- Jinkx, you bitch.
You're the first one
to win two challenges.
- It was such a toss-up
between you and 'Laska.
- Jinkx is my biggest
competition.
She's really funny,
and so am I, so...
[clicks tongue]
- And Roxxxy was in the top
three too.
- We're trying to get Jinkx
out of here.
She's a big threat, and I don't
know where I got to get you,
but I got to find
somewhere that you lack.
- RuPaul, can we please sew
something for next week?
- No sewing, Ru!
- So I can win a damn challenge!
- Let's just hope
I have enough fabric
to braid myself another dress.
[laughs]
- I'm sorry, my dear.
Your sewing looks like shit.
- I just feel like
there are people
who are just waiting for me
to screw up big-time.
- Your sewing looks like
Coco's performance.
Shit.
- It's turned quickly from
<i>Sisterhood</i>
<i>of the Traveling Pants</i>
to "Sisterhood of I'm going
to kill you so I can win."
- The winner
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i>
receives a sickening supply
of Colorevolution cosmetics,
a luxury trip,
courtesy of alandchuck.travel,
headline Logo's<i> Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> tour,</i>
featuring Absolut vodka,
cocktails perfected,
and a cash prize of $100,000.
And tonight,
extra-special guest judges
Clinton Kelly
and George Kotsiopoulos.
-<i> Cinco, cinco, cinco.</i>
We're back in the workroom,
it's a new week,
and I am terrified
of messing up now.
[siren blares]
- Ooh, girl!
You've got shemail!
Sometimes a drag queen's gotta
do what a drag queen's gotta do,
whether it's laying a foundation
or painting the house down.
You've got to spackle,
Neely, spackle!
- [laughs]
- Remember the golden shower
rule:
Do unto others
as you would have them
do unto Ru.
- Oh...
- What?
- Hello, hello, hello.
all: Hi, Ru.
- Now, to keep you
in fighting shape,
for today's mini challenge,
you're going to go to...
drag booty camp.
- Oh...
- [chuckles]
- So put on your workout gear,
including heels by Le Dame
and boobs from
The Breast Form Store.
Go!
- Ooh.
- Le Dame.
- This must be
what my mom feels like.
Yeah, yeah.
- Ladies, meet your
personal trainer.
From Barry's Bootcamp, Storm.
- Mash.
- Now, the one queen
that outlasts the others...
wins.
- Ooh.
- Let's get it up, come on.
I don't know,
but I've been told.
all: I don't know,
but I've been told.
- Drag queen shade
is mighty cold.
all: Drag queen shade
is mighty cold.
- Pump it, girls.
Pump it, ladies.
Keep that energy up.
Jinkx, you took off your heels.
- They fell off!
- Come on, you call yourself
a drag queen?
- Here we go, ladies.
- Pull up.
Come on, count it off.
- I don't like working out
around other people.
I get ugly when I work out.
- Get up, get up, get up!
- [grunting]
- Detox, you're out.
Keep crunching, come on.
Coco, you're out.
Keep it going.
Roxxxy, you're out.
Up!
It's just between
Jinkx and Alaska.
Come on, now.
- Finally, my opportunity
to push Jinkx
down the proverbial stairs.
- Who's gonna be the last queen
crunching?
- Oh, Jinkx is out.
Alaska wins.
[clapping]
- Whoo-hoo!
Let's do some more!
- Alaska, condragulations.
- Thank you.
- Bye, ladies.
I'll see you at the gym.
- See ya there.
Not really.
- Now, you ladies have bravely
soldiered
through challenge
after challenge.
Now it's time to give back
to those who have
sacrificed so much
to serve this great nation.
Oh, boys!
- [gasps]
- God bless America.
- These gentlemen,
who also happen to be gay,
served our country
before the repeal
of "Don't ask, don't tell."
Thanks to these men,
we have the freedom
to be fierce.
And now, you get to exercise
that freedom
by enlisting these men
into your drag house.
- Oh, shit.
I'm nervous, 'cause I've never
done anyone else's makeup.
- Now, Alaska,
you won the mini challenge,
so you get to pair
the queens with their vets.
- Well, everything happens
for a reason...
- Uh-huh.
- And these men came in
in this order for a reason.
So I want to go straight down
the line, so--Izzy, is it?
- Yes.
- You are going to be
with Roxxxy Andrews.
- Alaska tells RuPaul,
"Everything happens
for a reason."
I think it was sabotage.
I thought we were closer
than this.
It pissed me off.
- Dave, you're going
to be with Jinkx Monsoon.
- Hi, Dave.
- You'll have so much fun
with Jinkx.
Jinkx is my biggest
competition right now,
so maybe it would be an
impediment having an older man.
Steve, you're going
to be with Coco.
- So big and strong.
- Aaron, you're going
to be with lady Detox.
- You're beautiful.
- Thank you.
- And, Alaska,
that means you have Mack.
- I think pairing myself
with the tall, pretty one
is probably
a really good strategy.
- Now, ladies,
we're gonna be looking
for a strong family resemblance.
A true expression of your drag.
Attention!
Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best woman...
win!
- So you've never,
ever been in drag before?
- No, I have not.
- Okay.
[laughs]
Who are some of your
diva inspirations?
- Uh...
Judy Garland.
- I can see us doing a Judy/Liza
kind of thing together.
- I knew Judy, by the way.
- You did?
- Yes.
- You knew Judy Garland?
What was she like?
- She was actually really nice.
- That's amazing.
I feel like the luckiest drag
queen in this room right now,
'cause I know these young guys
don't have stories like that.
And look, Detox
is more concerned
about sleeping with her, um...
- I can tell.
- Ha!
- Even though I got paired up
with the oldest vet,
I get to work
with one of the sweetest,
coolest people in the room.
- We have to give you body.
- Okay.
- Stand up for me.
- You can't tell in these pants,
but I have a big butt.
- Do you have a big butt?
That's perfect,
'cause I have a huge ass.
Oh, it is a nice butt.
We're still gonna
make it bigger.
- I got a really hot guy.
Like, ah, Jesus.
He's really sweet, and a total
sissy, and I really like that.
I just want all you bitches
to pay attention really quick.
And let Aaron show you
how it's fucking done.
- Oh, my God,
she's done this before.
- I love it!
- I'm not happy at all.
Izzy is shorter
and he's hairy.
I'm pissed.
- Coming up...
Can we see a little bit
of her walk?
- Yeah.
- Ooh--whoa, whoa.
- I got--I got it.
- Really?
- I think I might have killed
Judy Garland.
- [laughs]
[laughs]
- Today, we have to make over
our gay vet.
Have you ever worn Leg Avenue?
- [laughs]
No.
- And we have to do a complete
family resemblance runway look.
Is that the Michael Levine
fabric?
Oh, my God,
we're gonna be gorgeous.
[chuckles]
- Give me a little runway.
Oh, fuck.
- Oh, my God, hold on.
I got to see this.
You look like Jennifer Lopez
as Jesus.
[laughs]
- I got another thing comin'
for y'all.
I have a fuel under my ass.
He's going to be
drop-dead gorgeous.
- Get naked.
Let's try this on you.
I'm having a difficult time
working with my partner
because he's fucking beautiful.
[whistles]
So do you have a boyfriend
or anything?
- No.
- Thank you, gay God.
I just got lady wood
for you walking.
- If Detox doesn't
win this challenge,
she'll have no one
to blame but herself.
Here, put on these.
- Okay.
You got to understand
that bending over
can be a trip sometimes.
I have a medical condition.
In fact, I fell down
the other day.
- Dave's kind of top-heavy,
and it makes it very hard
for him to walk around.
Hold my hand.
Focus on walking on your toes
a little bit more.
It's a distinct possibility
I'm going to be
in the bottom two tomorrow.
Okay.
- Ooh--whoa, whoa.
- I got--I got it.
- You okay?
This big, buff man
in camouflage pants
and a pair of heels...
I never thought I'd be putting
a man's breasts on.
- [laughs]
- Oh, God, Steve,
we've got to pull this off.
'cause if I'm in the bottom two,
this may be my last supper.
- You haven't?
- Uh-uh.
- Well, how'd you
get yours, then?
- My friend made them for me.
- Oh.
- I've seen
a YouTube video of it.
All I have is a pair of scissors
and this really hard foam,
and so I'm just hoping
they'll look passable.
What inspired you to, like,
get into the military?
- I grew up in foster care,
and my 18th birthday,
my foster mom was like,
"You have to find a place
to live.
I'll give you a week."
and so I joined the military,
and I got out of it structure,
discipline...
- Wow.
- And now I'm ready
to be out on my own.
- It shows a great
amount of wisdom.
He said, "My life needs order
that I never got."
It's very admirable.
All right, now remember,
you're a woman, not a man.
Walk softly.
Mack is walking
like a Mack truck driver.
Ladies take soft steps.
Any advantage I thought I had
because of Mack's appearance
completely vanishes
because of the way
that he is holding himself.
- Hello, hello, hello.
all: Hi, Ru.
- Oh, dear, I see
lots of titties up in here.
Hello, Jinkx and Dave.
- Hello.
- Hi, Ru.
- How's it going over here?
- He and I decided we're going
to do a Judy and Liza tribute.
- Oh, my goodness.
- And I've got the backstory.
- Tell me about that.
- I think I might have killed
Judy Garland.
[record needle scratch effect]
We were talking
one night at dinner,
and she asked me
about the new sleeping pills
that were out.
I told her about a new one,
and she died of an overdose.
- Dave has got Ru speechless.
How do you respond to, "I think
I killed Judy Garland"?
He's a monsoon, all right.
- Well, you know, Dave, she
worked real hard to get there.
All right, listen,
you kids get back to work,
and I can't wait to see ya.
- Thank you.
- Yeah.
- All right.
House of Alaska.
Mack has big, old titties,
no makeup,
and your skin is perfect.
- Oh, you haven't seen
my walk yet.
- Well, right, uh...
- Can we see a little bit of it?
- It's a work in progress.
It's hard breaking
the man out of Mack.
- Really?
The Armed Services
pushed it inside of you.
I--that came out wrong.
- [laughs]
- You have a lot of work to do.
You better sissy
that walk, Mack.
- You got it, Ru.
- I'll see you guys later.
Detox and Aaron.
Oh, my goodness,
you are working on it already.
- Hi, Ru.
She's my little baby doll.
The first thing
out of her mouth was,
"I need to put shoes on now,"
and she's been sissying
that walk up and down
this entire workroom.
- Good, good.
- [laughs]
- So, Aaron,
Don't Ask Don't Tell--
how has that
affected your life?
- I've served before and after.
And serving before,
it was tough, because I was,
you know, 22 and living
in the Castro,
and, like, gay, gay, gay.
- Yeah.
- And it was such culture shock
coming back in the closet.
- What's it like now?
- It takes
a little weight off you.
- Mm-hmm.
- And it's nice to be able to,
without fear of repercussion,
just really be that person.
- I'm so happy that
you are here with us,
and that you are out and proud,
and I cannot wait to see you.
- Me too.
- Thank you, Ru.
- See ya.
- Bye.
- The house of Montrese.
- Hi, Ru.
- Now, you've got some
wide hips, there.
Have you done drag before?
- No, never, Ru.
- Never.
- I feel, like,
how do they do that?
I mean, you guys got balls,
seriously.
- Oh, yeah, we do have balls.
- [laughs]
- Steve, now what made you
join the military?
- I always had an issue with
my--with being homosexual.
It was a way for me
to become straight.
I thought I would go in there,
they'll buff you up,
and yell at you.
- When you hear that,
you think about the other guys
that did it too.
Why can't people just let people
be who they are?
- I was young, I was stupid...
- Yeah.
- The Marines did teach me,
you know, how to be a man,
and how to not take things
so seriously.
- A lot like drag.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Now, let me tell ya,
Coco needs your help.
She was in the bottom two
last week.
- Ya gotta bring that up, Ru?
Really?
- She's counting on you
to be a fierce queen.
- [laughs]
- All right, kids,
get back to it.
I will see you
on the main stage.
- Bye, Ru.
- Roxxxy and Izzy--now, Izzy,
have you ever done drag before?
- Never.
- Have you ever worn heels
before?
- Never.
- So are you gonna show a little
of the--[clicks tongue]
You know, 'cause that's what
the Andrews are famous for.
Do you have any peanut butter?
- No.
- [sighs]
- What's the biggest challenge,
in this challenge, for you?
- I want to make sure that
whatever I'm making her,
that she is gonna feel
comfortable 100%.
- Well, I'll let you
get back to it, okay?
- Okay.
By no way, shape, or form do I
think I'm done and feeling good.
- All right,
gather round, everybody!
Now, tomorrow on the main stage,
we'll be joined by our
extra-special guest judges,
two men who know
a lot about makeovers.
From<i> What Not To Wear,</i>
Clinton Kelly will be here.
[cheers and applause]
And from<i> The Fashion Police,</i>
George Kotsiopoulos.
[cheers and applause]
Oh, and one more little thing.
In addition to
walking the runway,
each team needs to come up with
a patriotic
color guard presentation.
So raise your flag high
and don't fuck it up.
Coming up...
- Mack is extremely manly.
- Oh!
We don't know what the fuck
we're doing.
- [laughs]
[laughs]
- How do you feel at it?
- I feel alive.
- Our main challenge today
is to make gay veterans
into part of our drag family,
and to come up with a color
guard routine
to present on the runway.
Hmm, hmm, three...
- Oh, fuck.
- We don't know
what the fuck we're doing.
We haven't really
planned anything,
we're kind of making it up
as we go.
Oh!
[laughs]
Closer.
[sighs]
Do you have any ideas?
- Turn, turn, turn.
And turn around.
- Turn around.
- Don't fall, don't fall.
- I won't fall, I'm good.
- Those shoes
are killing you, huh?
Steve is determined to do
his rehearsal in these heels,
but the aches and pains
are all over his face.
Ah!
- Shut up.
- I think as much as Steve
wants to be prepared
for what it takes
to be in these heels...
Take 'em off.
Yeah, just take 'em off.
I don't think
he was ready for this.
- Oh, uh-uh.
- No?
- Oh, no, baby.
I'm gonna fall off of these.
- Are they too high?
- Yeah.
- I don't want you
to hurt yourself.
- I mean, I do have
a medical condition, you know?
- What's that?
- I will be honest with you.
And, uh, I took a medicine, and
it caused me to look like this.
It also wasted the muscles
in my legs.
I just can't hold myself up.
- Okay. We're gonna
find a way to work with it.
- Okay.
- I mean, there's a million
and one things
we can do to overcome this.
And we're a team.
You're not in this alone.
- I'll be right back.
- [whimpers]
Dave is surviving with HIV,
and his body went through
a massive transformation,
and it makes it very hard
for him to walk around,
let alone walk in heels,
but Dave's heart is so in it
that he wants
to give it his all.
We're gonna work with it,
not against you.
- Pop that foam, girl.
Pop that foam.
Hey, how you doin'?
[laughter]
I love it.
And...
Can we do that together, though?
- I'm just scared.
I'm scared, I'm scared,
I'm scared.
- All right.
I don't know what color guard
or flag twirling is.
So let's start
from sword fighting.
- And then like that,
and then what if I took
this one away
and then touched yours?
And then, you pull it back.
You're, like... [groans]
[laughs]
Like you just touched my dick,
or my sword fantasy,
whatever you call it.
- Well.
We're figuring it out
a lot on the fly.
[mimics marching music]
Um...
and then what?
- Dave is using the flag
as a cane,
both for comedic
and practical reasons,
but I choreographed our piece
to be well within
his capability.
Come on, Mama!
Come on!
And give the Judy Garland
a little swagger.
I have been trying to pull away
from camp and schtick
in this competition,
but I would rather him be safe
than try to lay all this
complicated choreography on him.
It's me and my mama!
- [laughs]
- Do one around.
- Uhh!
- Mama,
your skirt's falling down!
- I know.
- Oh, Mama!
Tomorrow, I wanna win
for Dave's sake.
- It is time to become women.
- Let's do this.
- Ready or not, here comes Mama!
- Today's elimination day.
I have a bunch of things
to do with Izzy.
We have to get him shaven.
It's time to get some clippers
and get this hair off of him.
[razor vibrates]
Blah! Uhh!
I hate body hair.
- [laughs]
- Fish, dude.
Let's get this chest.
Izzy turned out to be an angel.
He knows that whatever
he has to do to help us win,
he's gonna do it.
He's definitely being a trooper,
no pun intended.
[laughter]
[spits]
You're the only hairy one here?
That's okay 'cause guess what?
We can get rid of hair.
They can't get rid
of those faces.
- Exactly.
- All makeup, no talent.
- "All makeup, no talent"?
Is that what you're saying,
Coco?
Coco and Steve are throwing
a lot of shade,
but let's see when
the faces come out,
'Cause Coco don't know
how to paint faces.
- She's making you a black girl.
- I am not!
- You are, girl!
- All that makeup on his face!
- [laughs]
- Get the fuck away from me,
Detox.
Shit.
I don't paint
other people's face.
That's not something
you can learn overnight,
and I got a few hours.
- Horchata looks like a cross
between one of the Jackson 5s
and a member from<i> Cats.</i>
- Oh, shit.
I look scary.
- Am I doing this right?
You know I don't know
how to glue down brows.
Sweetie, we're in a competition.
I can't help you
or your manly man.
- But look how pretty he is.
- Tell me what happened
when you were discovered
to be a homosexual
in the service.
- The house that I had
in Washington, D.C.,
we had four of us,
two Marines and two sailors.
We decided we wanted to go
to our favorite gay bar
in full uniform, what we called
"high drag" in those days.
There was a spy.
It got back to the base,
and all four of us
were put on notice that
we were going to be discharged
for being gay.
- He's been through everything
that you could guess
a 67-year-old gay veteran
could have possibly
been through.
- One of the boys ended up
being court-martialed
because, in those days,
it was illegal to be gay,
and he ended up in Leavenworth
ward for a year.
- It's so important
to learn about the struggles
that people like Dave have been
through to get us the rights
that we take for granted.
- So that car accident
that you were in--
- Mm-hmm.
- What happened there?
- I was leaving a gig,
and apparently,
there was this guy who got
kicked out of the bar.
He left his car parked
in the middle of the freeway
with no lights on
and was sleeping in his car.
We just ran into him
going 80 or 90 miles an hour.
My face kind of ricocheted
off the windshield,
and I lost, like,
this part of my forehead.
I severed the main artery
in my head, and...
- Oh, my God.
- Like, almost bled out
in a matter of minutes.
- Jesus Christ.
Did that change anything
about you?
- I didn't leave the house
for, like, two months
because I just felt like
such a Frankenstein.
After the accident,
it was pretty traumatizing
because I was in the hospital
for so long,
and I was really weak.
I was so depressed.
I would go visit drag shows,
and they really kinda
pulled me out of that,
and, were, like,
"Just get back into it, girl.
You look fine, you'll be good."
Getting back into doing drag and
throwing myself into my work
really helped me,
but I still can't
grow eyebrows on this side.
Luckily, I can paint them on.
[snickers]
I just pull it down
and then take the rest
of your weed whacker
and pull it all the way back.
- That's not gonna hurt?
- No, just try it.
- [laughs]
- Now, what do you tape it to?
- You pull the tape
up to your butt.
[tape ripping]
It's time for Steve to tuck,
and this is a process.
A very long process.
How the fuck do you do this?
The bucket's slipping out.
- Do I have to come back there
and put it up for you?
'Cause I will.
- Oh, looks like camel toe.
- Camel toe is in this season.
[chuckling]
- [whistles]
Can't walk in it.
- Coming up...
- You were making
major missteps.
- And that was not glamorous.
It was not elegant.
It was not chic.
- Just show us a smile
from time to time.
- [laughs]
[laughs]
[laughs]
- Welcome to the main stage
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
Michelle Visage,
for those about
to frock, we salute you.
- Ahoy!
- The great Santino.
- You look gorgeous, Ru.
- Thank you.
From<i> What Not To Wear,</i>
Clinton Kelly!
Guess what I'm not wearing.
[laughter]
Makeup.
[laughter]
It's true.
-<i> Au naturel,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> I love it.</i>
- And, from<i> The Fashion Police,</i>
George Katsiopoulos.
Now, are you excited to be here?
- This is more exciting
than the Academy Awards.
Are you kidding me?
- [laughs]
- I love this show!
- So happy to have you here.
This week, we challenged our
queens to earn their stripes
by transforming gay veterans
into members
of their drag family.
Gentlemen, start your engines
and may the best woman win.
- Immediately, I drop a flag.
Bam!
Fuck.
- Our flag routine is fun,
goofy, and weird, just like me.
- Horchata is turning it out.
She's smiling.
She's buckin'.
She's doing her thing.
- Every time I looked over
at Isabella,
she was doing exactly
what she needed to do.
Could not have gone any better.
I think we might
pull through tonight.
- Commence shakedown.
- Ladies, forward march.
From the house of Monsoon,
Jinkx and Fortuna.
- Judy looks more like Liza
these days.
- Yes!
- We are serving mama
and gypsy realness.
I think we really hit the nail
on the head with this one.
Meet me in the middle
and give 'em a little hip!
Here we go, and, oh!
You got it!
[laughter]
Now, that's enter-taint-ment.
The house of Andrews,
Roxxxy and Isabella.
- That's the Andrews sisters.
- Uh-huh.
- Bam!
- The look on Izzy's face--
she is feeling it.
She is loving it.
Yeah, bitches, get into it.
- The missing Kardashian
sisters.
- Big booties
must run in the family.
- Yeah.
- The house of Alaska
featuring
Alaska and Nebraska,
cat burglars.
- Okay, that's more
like Miss Nebraska
'cause she is a beauty queen.
- Yes.
- We're feeling good.
We're skipping down the runway.
I'm very proud
of little Nebraska.
- I didn't know Patty Hearst
had daughters.
- Uh-huh.
[laughter]
- The house of Detox:
Detox and Bethadone,
hunting for red October.
- Bethadone and I are stomping
it out and being playful,
and you can just tell that
he's living for himself,
which is the purpose
of this whole challenge.
- America the booty-ful.
Lucky for these girls,
it's fleet week.
The house of Montrese!
Coco and Horchata Montrese.
Mm, I'm thirsty.
- Horchata's giving you nothing
but pure showgirl,
and I'm giving you
nothing but red carpet,
Montrese-style.
- Red sky at night,
sailor's delight.
- Is that your boa, or are you
just ready to flock me?
- [laughs]
Coming up...
- The boots are just
unforgivable.
I hate them.
- Those pads, it looks like
there's hams in there.
- You seem very upset.
- It was a shit show.
- [laughs]
Welcome, ladies!
First up, the house of Monsoon,
Jinkx and Fortuna.
Dave, let's take a look
at your before.
And look at you now.
- As complicated
as your choreography was,
you were both in sync
with one another,
and it wasn't overly complicated
where you were dropping things
or making major missteps.
- You did have
a very difficult task
dressing someone in their 60s,
and I actually wouldn't change
anything about the styling.
I think you guys look
incredible.
- Well, Dave, I'm honored
to have you here,
especially since you're one of
the queens from back in the day.
- I thought you were gonna say
"The oldest."
- [laughs]
- That would be Michelle.
[laughter]
- Up next:
The house of Andrews,
Roxxxy and Isabella.
Now, this is Izzy before,
and this is Isabella.
So how do you feel, Izzy?
- I feel like I could give
Santino a mustache ride.
- [shouts]
- Come on with it!
- One thing about
the house of Andrews:
We're hos, miss thang, and this
one came right into it.
- You are absolutely gorgeous.
I love that you did
the traditional Andrews ass,
and you really look like
family members.
- Wow.
- You were in perfect unison
for most of the routine,
which was really fun,
and, Isabella,
that booty shake was seriously
grade A.
I mean,
I could not get over that.
- Next up,
from the house of Alaska,
Alaska, the 49th state,
and Nebraska, the 37th state.
- Ohh.
- Mack, let's take a look
at your before picture,
and let's take
a look at you now.
Ooh, ooh!
Nebraska, tell me about
the challenge.
What was the hardest part?
- I was a little bit
uncomfortable at the beginning,
and as soon as she
brought out the weapons
and I was in the gear,
I was ready for battle.
- Stop using sex
as a weapon, Nebraska.
- [laughs]
- Well, didn't you get
the pretty pearl?
I mean, Nebraska came out,
and I was, like, "Whoa!"
The flag routine
didn't really come off
the way you wanted it to.
I think there were things
out of sync
and falling apart
here and there.
- Those hip pads, I mean,
it looks like there's
hams in there.
- You had, like,
the perfect model to work with,
and it just makes me sad
to see lumpy padding,
and the boots
are just unforgivable.
I just hate--I hate them.
- All right.
Next up: The house of Detox,
Detox and Bethadone.
- Hello.
- This is Aaron before,
and look at you now.
So, Bethadone, what was tougher:
Basic training
or getting up into drag?
- I'm definitely gonna
have to say basic training...
[laughter]
But this definitely wasn't easy.
- I'm interested in why Detox
put that bow in the front
after we read Roxxxy
down for that.
- Oh, 'cause I don't
pay attention to Roxy.
[laughter]
- But you should
pay attention to critiques.
- That performance,
you dropped the flag.
They got twisted up.
God, it was just--
- It was a shit show.
- Bethadone looked like
she was having a lot of fun.
She was really smiling,
and you didn't seem to be
having as much fun.
Just show us a smile
from time to time.
- All right, next up:
The house of Montrese,
Coco and Horchata.
Now, this is Steve before,
and look at you now.
Steve, what was the hardest part
of it for you?
- The heels and the makeup.
- Good, then, it's working.
- [chuckles]
- You guys really went
for, like, the Olympics here
with your flag routines.
It's not necessary.
- I can tell
that you've never done
someone else's hair and makeup.
There's subtle blending
and highlighting
that you didn't do.
- And the irregular hem makes
it seem like you made a gown
for yourself and you gave
your sister the scraps
that were kind of left over.
- You seem very upset.
- It seems like every week,
I'm letting you down,
letting you down,
letting you down.
- Listen, it's part of the game
of being criticized by judges.
I've been in front of any kind
of critic you can imagine.
Have fun with it.
As an entertainer, you know
that if you're not having fun,
the audience doesn't have fun.
You just gotta remember that.
I'm so proud that we got
to share this with these fellas
from the military
and showing them
what they were fighting for.
They don't tell them that
when they enroll,
that you're fighting for our
freedom to dress up in drags.
This is a fabulous country!
And I'm so proud, right now,
to be an American citizen.
All right, a little ki-ki
on the stage.
- Ohh!
- Thank you, ladies,
and thank you, veterans.
Now, while you untuck in
the Interior Illusions Lounge,
the judges and I
will deliberate.
All right, now, just between us
civilians, what do you think?
Jinkx Monsoon and Fortuna.
- When she and Fortuna came out
with their flag routine,
I thought, "Jinkx is going
to be in the bottom,"
but I have to tell you,
she made up for it and then some
with her mother-daughter Gypsy
Rose Lee and Mama routine.
- My only criticism would be
that Dave is 67,
but Fortuna looks
a little bit older than that.
- The house of Andrews,
Roxxxy and Isabella.
- It wasn't too complicated,
but what they did do,
it was well practiced,
well rehearsed.
Roxy did a bang-up job.
- Well, I love the Mini-Me vibe
that they were giving out,
and oh, my God,
they should just win
on that padding alone
because I didn't even know
it was padding.
It was amazing.
- What did you think of house
of Alaska and Nebraska?
- I think Alaska
needs to work on her craft.
That transformation
was really weak
compared to
what she had to work with.
- I was not as compelled
by Alaska
as I was by Nebraska,
and I think that's a problem.
- Moving on to the house
of Detox and Bethadone.
- The complicated flag twirling
was a mess, seriously.
- They look like deranged
Raggedy Ann dolls,
and I'm just questioning
whether or not
there's a taste level there.
- Coco and Horchata Montrese.
- Poor Horchata.
I mean, poor, poor Horchata.
- That was not glamorous.
It was not elegant.
It was not chic.
You know, I'm thinking Coco
might need to go
back to beauty school.
- The flag show was a disaster,
and she would never
let herself go out
with a busted-up face like that.
- Never, ever.
- No?
- Please.
- It was like Frida Kahlo.
It was a giant eyebrow
walking down the stage.
- Silence!
I've made my decision.
Bring back the girls.
[laughs]
Welcome back, ladies.
I've made some decisions.
Jinkx Monsoon, your Liza
and Judy-inspired drag
took us over the rainbow.
You're safe.
- Thank you.
- I'm safe.
- Roxxxy Andrews, you set out
to turn a salty seaman
into your sexy sister.
Mission accomplished.
Condragulations, you are the
winner of this week's challenge.
[applause]
- Girl, you won!
- You and your drag sister have
each won a shopping spree
at American Apparel.
Izzy can decide
if he wants to shop
in the men's
or the women's department.
- Female.
- Gah!
This is my second win.
Finally.
- Coco Montrese.
Tonight, you didn't give us
what we were thirsty for.
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
- Oy.
- Oy.
- [speaks Spanish]
- For the fourth time,
doesn't look too good.
- Alaska, your cross-country
crime spree
didn't steal the show.
Detox, your Marine makeover
hit a snafu.
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
Alaska, you may join
the other girls.
- Thank you.
- Two queens stand before me.
Prior to tonight,
you were asked to prepare
a lip-synch performance
of<i> (it takes) Two</i>
by Seduction featuring
Michelle Visage.
Ladies, this is your
last chance to impress me
and save yourself
from elimination.
The time has come
for you to lip-synch
for your life.
- On a scale of one to ten,
my lip-synching
is probably a 25.
- Ready, set, go.
Let's do this.
- Good luck,
and don't fuck it up.
- I'm giving it my all.
This is Michelle Visage's song,
and I'm gon' wear it out
just for her.
- I pull out all these
old-school dance moves,
and I'm just sitting there
whopping it out
and doing the cabbage patch
and having a good time.
- Yes!
[cheers and applause]
- Ladies, I've made my decision.
Detox, shante, you stay.
You may join the other girls.
- I'm sorry.
- Coco Montrese,
I want you to hear this.
You never let me down,
and I am cuckoo for Coco.
Now sashay away.
- [crying]
Thank you.
[whispers]
Thank you.
- Thank you.
[indistinct chatter]
- This is one of the most
amazing experiences of my life.
I did my best.
I think Alyssa and I can put
the past behind us.
I gained a lot of closure, which
I probably would have never got
if it wasn't for RuPaul,
so I'm very happy.
- My fab four.
Condragulations.
Victory is yours!
Now, remember,
if you can't love yourself,
how in the hell
you gonna love somebody else?
Can I get an amen in here?
all: Amen.
- All right,
now let the music play.


- Previously on
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race...</i>
- Coco Montrese.
- Alyssa Edwards.
- The pageant
tore our friendship apart.
- Alyssa and I will have
our moment later.
- Jinkx, on the runway,
I think you should have prepared
more than one look.
- Every week I've done
a different look.
- Bullshit.
Jinkx, she's all comedy
and no glamour.
- You will be creating
your own signature fragrance.
- My fragrance is called
Alyssa's Secret.
- What is Alyssa's secret?
- Son of a bitch.
- Can we see your background?
- New York City.
- Uh, that's Tokyo.
- Oh, is it?
- I have a crush
on Ivy Winters.
- [gasps]
- Red, for filth.
Are you red-y for me?
- Alaska, you're the winner
of this challenge.
- Ha-ha!
- Alyssa Edwards,
shantay, you stay.
Ivy, sashay away.
- Aw, Ivy Winters.
- "I love you girls so much.
You always have a friend in me."
- Girl, she is
an amazing person.
- Yeah.
- Amazing, amazing.
Ivy and I were really connecting
and really feeling very close.
And the person who's been
such a good friend to me
is now gone.
- Coco, now I know
what it feels like
to be in the bottom,
twice.
- Was it horrifying
being up there again?
- No, I'm a performer, baby.
This is what I do.
So if I have to
lip sync for my life
all the way to the final,
I'll do what I got to do.
- So what you're saying
to me is,
"Well, it doesn't matter
about the challenges.
If I fall short every time,
I'll just lip sync my way back."
- I'm confident about
performance.
I'm not confident in my acting.
That horrible cologne commercial
and that Katy Perry and that--
- But those are our challenges.
- Listen, let me explain
something to you.
- No, you're not my mama,
don't explain nothing to me,
sweetie.
- Some people should just
call a spade a spade
and say,
"Hey, I like competition.
I just don't like the work
that comes along with it."
- Coco, you and I need to talk
about something too.
Something that keeps getting
said to me and to Alaska.
I feel like I've been labeled
as a comedy queen
in a belittling way, and--
- Oh, my God.
- There's a double standard
going on right now.
When I do well
in the challenges,
they just kind of
roll their eyes
because I don't have
their respect.
I am working just as hard as
anyone else here at everything.
- Jinkx--
- And to say that you're just
a comedy queen is belittling...
- Jinkx--
- Something I have made my whole
career on--I am talking.
It is something
I work very hard at.
- How many times have y'all
called us pageant queens?
- Jinkx, I told you the same
thing when you brung this up.
That you said "pageant queen."
- That's all I had to say.
- Oh.
- These pageant girls
keep telling me,
"I don't want to be a pageant
girl for the rest of my life."
Well, then, fucking stop
calling me the comedy queen.
I'm sick of that.
- Of course, the pageant girls
are going to discount
the comedy freaks.
The best revenge
is just to do better.
- The winner of
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
receives a sickening supply
of Colorevolution cosmetics,
a luxury trip courtesy of
alandchuck.travel,
headline Logos Drag Race tour
featuring Absolut vodka--
cocktails perfected--
and a cash prize of $100,000.
And tonight,
extra special guest judges,
Maria Conchita Alonso
and Jamie-Lynn Sigler.
- Yay.
[overlapping chatter]
- Good "mornting."
- This morning, I'm kind of
on pins and needles.
Everyone else is just out
for themselves.
I hope we get to do a challenge
and not be in a group.
[siren blares]
-<i> Ooh, girl!</i>
<i>You've got shemail.</i>
Like sands
through the hourglass,
so are your days
at<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
<i>Escandalo!</i>
To become America's next
drag superstar,
you need to deliver the drama,
mama.
<i>Adios, muchachas.</i>
- All: Ooh.
- Hello, hello, hello.
[overlapping greetings]
For today's mini-challenge,
we're going to play
the crying game...
- Oh, no.
- Where you need to cry on cue.
Tears.
So put on some mascara
and meet me
in the sharing circle.
Alaska,
cry me a river.
- Sebastian and I were wed,
but suddenly, last summer,
everything changed.
- It was my first dance recital
ever.
I waved bye to Grandma.
Bye.
- I knew that one day
I wanted to become a woman.
[sobs]
- I know this will be
hard to believe,
seeing as I'm the most polished,
prettiest drag queen here.
- Being an Orange County
housewife...
is not as glamorous
as it seems.
My husband,
he was addicted to sex.
- It gets so hard
being called the bearded lady.
[sobs]
- Separate rooms
on our second honeymoon.
[sobbing]
Oh, God.
- There's nothing more sad
than the tears of a drag queen.
- Maybe it's just time for me
to go home
to Seattle.
- Jinkx was supposed to be
making me cry,
but she was making me laugh.
[laughs]
- [sobs]
- I gave that man everything
I had.
- Detox.
- Um, I'm not gonna lie.
I'm having a hard time
with this challenge.
It's hard for me to even try to
be in character right now.
I really want to be
just completely honest
and just say how difficult
this is.
[sniffles]
I lost my boyfriend
two years ago...
and looking around the room
and seeing
mournful-looking characters,
and I feel like I felt
the day that I saw him dead.
And it's really hard for me
to try to stay out of that
right now.
[sniffles]
[sobs]
I'm not used to being
so vulnerable
and looking so vulnerable,
and I feel very uncomfortable.
- Thank you for sharing
your story.
- I'm so glad that she is
sharing her story.
And it's never something
that's gonna get easy.
But something that every time
you talk about,
will make it easier.
- Okay, girls,
no more tears.
Ladies, thanks again
for sharing.
The two winners of today's
mini-challenge are...
Detox and Alyssa.
Condragulations.
[applause]
For this week's main challenge,
you'll be starring
in two primetime soaps.
And you'll be doing it...
telenovela style.
- Son of a bitch.
And it's another
acting challenge.
- One script is<i> Casa de Locas.</i>
House of the Crazies.
The other,<i> Ella No es Dama.</i>
She's No Lady.
Detox and Alyssa.
First, you need to pick
your cast.
Detox.
- Roxxxy.
- Como?
[laughter]
- Alyssa.
- Jinkx.
- All right, Detox.
- You know I love you, Coco,
but I have to reform Rolaskatox.
- Por que?
<i>Ay, dios mio.</i>
[laughter]
- Uh-oh, I don't want the judges
to see me relying
on the crutch of a clique.
- So that means, Coco,
you're with Alyssa.
- After all that drama with
Coco, Jinkx, and me,
we're all on the same team.
Go team Alyssa.
- Caballeros,
start your engines.
And may the best<i> mujer</i><span style="bodyStyle"> win.</i>
[all shouting<i> el grito]</i>
- This is the first time that
members of Rolaskatox are
working together
since I sort of decided that
we should all be free agents.
- [Italian accent]
We are now r-r-r-rich!
- You're so Italian.
- Muy r-r-r-rico.
[both laughing]
- That was perfect.
- It's terrible.
- Sometimes Detox's
sense of humor
gets in the way of
taking the things
that need to be taken seriously
serious.
- Michelle already warned you.
Cliques can be dangerous.
That reunion of Rolaskatox might
be broken up real fast.
-<i> Coming up...</i>
You cast Coco as the ugly,
stupid maid?
- Yes.
- You look beautiful, Detox.
- Ah!
- [laughing]
- [laughing]
- Oh, my God, that's sickening,
miss thing!
You have to use it.
- Today's main challenge is
serving up telenovela realness.
Oh, my God, I love it.
[trills]
- All:<i> Vaya con dios.</i>
- Telenovela is very loud
and in your face and dramatic.
-<i> Muerte.</i>
- And I am carrying his baby.
- [whispering indistinctly]
- Alyssa's not an actress,
but I guess like she said,
"I'll be bad in every challenge
and just get by
on the lip sync."
- I have the same disease!
I'm gonna be real drama there.
- You got to really, like,
bring it in,
'cause you rushing it like,
"I have the same disease!"
- I think Coco is definitely
trying to throw me off my game,
and I have to zone her out.
- Hola, hola, hola.
[overlapping greetings]
<i>Donde esta el drama?</i>
- All:<i> Aqui, aqui, aqui, aqui.</i>
- Hello, team Alyssa.
- La casa de locas.
- Yeah.
So what role are you playing,
Alyssa?
- I am playing a glamorous
woman of the house.
The ruler.
- Uh-huh.
- And Jinkx is my 18-year-old
virginal daughter.
So you cast Coco as the ugly,
stupid maid?
- Yes.
- Coco, in the past,
you and Alyssa
have had your differences.
Have you guys worked through
that?
- No.
- Well, I'm just trying to gauge
how close you guys were
and how big this rift was.
- We were close.
- I'm thinking<i> The Turning Point</i>
with Anne Bancroft
and Shirley MacLaine.
- Let's do Tyra Banks
and Naomi Campbell.
- Oh, okay.
- Oh, I'm Tyra Banks.
- Can I hear a little bit of it?
- Mamacita, mamacita,
Pablo asked me
to mar-r-r-ry him.
- Wait a minute,
is she Italian or is she--
- Oh, is it coming off Italian?
- Yeah, a little bit.
- Have I been Italian
this whole time?
[laughter]
- If you hear the names of food,
you will violently orgasm.
Read my lines.
[laughs]
- You got a lot of lines
to memorize.
You know, we're down
to six girls now,
and the stakes are very high,
all right?
- Thank you.
- I'm gonna let you
get back to it.
<i>Adios.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
- Thanks, Ru.
- Adios.
- Team Detox.
Oh, my goodness.
- Hi, Ru.
- So you're playing
the young ingenue.
- Yes, I am the virginal
18-year-old.
I think we know
why I'm a virgin.
[laughter]
- Now, Detox, you reunited
Rolaskatox.
- Uh-huh.
- Is that a good idea?
Could it be a little bit of
a easy crutch?
- We just are so full
of personality,
and we have a lot of fun
working together.
- Well, you know,
it's great to have fun,
but you also need to take
this challenge seriously.
Now, Alaska, what are you
worried about in this challenge?
- If every line is over the top,
then it's like, the really,
like, zinger lines lose their--
- I have to take this off.
[laughter]
- Now, Detox,
on the main stage,
the criticism you get is that
we're getting "B" plus.
We want "A" plus from you.
And I'm just interested that
you're going to take it to that
place wearing a mask.
- Whatchu talkin' 'bout,
Willis?
- This is getting down
to the wire.
Somebody's gonna go home.
And you got to make sure
it's not you.
- Right.
- You got a lot of work to do.
Get at it.
- All right, ladies,
gather around.
In a moment, you'll head
to the telenovela set,
and tomorrow on the main stage,
the category is...
<i>Latina lamorosa extravaganza.</i>
- Ooh.
- Señoritas.
Good luck
and don't fuck it up.
Bye,<i> eses.</i>
- Her critique was about
this mask.
I don't feel it anymore.
- Girl, I've been read too many
times for wearing masks.
- Yeah.
- I've been working with
this mask the whole day.
- I always listen to critiques,
and she told us that
for a reason.
- I think that people are taking
this whole mask thing
a little bit too seriously.
- So we're good on costumes?
- Uh, pretty much.
- Do you think I should wear
this dress, Jinkx?
The gold one.
- Now she's just going through
my wardrobe.
- I don't know what's going on
with Alyssa.
She's over in Jinkx's wardrobe,
trying to find something to wear
for the challenge?
Good luck with that.
- Ow, fuck!
- What are you doing?
- I just stabbed myself.
Girl, all tea, all shade,
the dress doesn't fit.
- [sighs]
- You've got a ton of--
- Bull fantasy fat.
- Alyssa, for a pageant girl,
she sure didn't bring
no clothes.
I think it's time for her to go.
And I don't think I'm the only
one that feels that way.
-<i> Coming up...</i>
Meet your handsome leading man.
- What?
- [screams]
- [moans]
- That's your orgasm, Alyssa?
- Have you ever had one?
- [laughing]
- [laughing]
- Team Detox.
<i>Hola, como esta?</i>
- Oh!
- My group is just about to
start shooting our telenovela,
and we're ready to blow it out
of the fucking park.
- Welcome to this lavish set,
furnished by Form Decor.
And say hello
to Maria Conchita Alonso.
- Que bonitas.
[overlapping greetings]
- And, ladies, meet your
handsome leading man...
Wilmer Valderrama.
- What?
[screaming]
Shut up!
- He is so gorgeous.
I want to have his babies.
- All right.
<i>Accion.</i>
- Diego.
<i>Que paso?</i>
- He is dead.
And now we must determine which
one of us killed him.
- I couldn't kill him.
Diego loved me.
And...
I gave him my virginity.
[all gasping]
And--
- Cut.
Try to keep the pace up.
<i>Accion.</i>
- Bring us the poison.
[glass clinking]
Our poison bit is going on
a long time.
Roxxxy and I are sort of
standing there like--
- Cut.
When you're serving it,
you don't really
have to be serving three
because we can't see that
you're going one, two, three.
- Okay.
- So to make it faster, just--
you know?
- Oh, okay, so--okay.
- Ladies, let's get into
your positions.
Now, Roxxxy, are you inching
over to Wilmer's crotch?
- Only my hand,
but you can't see it, right?
[laughter]
- Horn dog.
- Action.
- [gasps]
- [grunts]
- [gasps]
- Agh!
- Cut.
Could we tighten up
the slapping?
It looked a little,
you know--
- Both: [grunt]
- Agh!
- Cut.
Okay.
Ladies, you're fine.
- What?
- Thank you very much.
- Bye, Wilmer.
- Team Alyssa.
<i>Como esta?</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
- Muy bien.
- Si.
- We're prepared,
and we are prepared
to take this set by storm
and really deliver the drama.
-<i> Accion.</i>
- [gasps]
- It is I who cast the spell.
- You are<i> muy estupida</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
if you think you are going to
take over our<i> familia.</i>
I am serving up
some Sofia "Vergar-r-a-rasa"
realness.
When I'm not talking,
I want to be reacting to what
other people are saying.
- Maria, I have some bad news.
If you hear the names of food,
you will orgasm so violently.
- Chimichanga.
- Ah, oh!
<i>Ay, ay, si, si!</i>
<i>Si, si!</i>
- Nacho grande!
- Ah!
- Ay, ay!
- Oh, oh!
[gasping]
- Cut.
When Jinkxy is doing the orgasm,
Alyssa, you need to at least
match
what Jinkx is doing.
- Okay.
- Ah, come on, Alyssa,
I really, really want you
to pull this off.
We are a team.
- And it's supposed to be
an orgasm, so, you know--
- Yeah.
I was trying to be like
a 48-year-old having it.
- Yeah, but you also want to
steal the scene, you know.
- Yeah, okay.
- Chimichanga.
- [moaning exaggeratedly]
- [whimpering]
- Whoever Alyssa is sleeping
with
is apparently
not doing their job.
- [sobbing]
No!
- And cut.
That's your orgasm, Alyssa?
- Have you ever had one?
- Yeah.
I'm feeling so insecure,
and it's frustrating
because I want to be so fierce
and so sickening,
and I'm not.
- Action.
- Have you seen Maria
or her mother?
- No esta aqui.
- Cut.
- No estan.
- No estan.
- Aqui.
- Aqui.
- Yes.
- No estan aqui.
They are--
Oh, my God.
Wilmer.
Ooh.
- Cut.
- I looked at him,
and I forgot my line.
- Would you like to have dinner
with me?
- [purrs]
I forgot my line, Ru.
- That's not gonna do anything
for us as a group.
I'm nervous because
I don't want my very best
to be overshadowed
by someone else's very worst.
- That's a wrap.
[energetic salsa music]
- Ooh.
- Get ready for the kraken.
- Get ready for the kraken,
darling.
- Coming into tonight's
elimination,
we're all on pins and needles,
because we do not know
what the edited,
finished product
is gonna look like.
Look, someone's gonna go home,
so I need to get my wigs ready.
- Alyssa, if you wear
one more do, bitch,
where you whip it off
to one side--
- Girl, if you wear one more
stretch costume, girl--
- [gasps]
- Go work on your outfits,
'cause I think
you're running out.
- Ooh!
- It's done.
- Wait, wait, wait, Alyssa,
do you have enough stuff
to get through
the rest of the competition?
- Girl, yes, ma'am.
And I can sew if I have to sew.
- Alyssa, you ain't gonna
have to sew
'cause you'll be goin' in
everybody else's wardrobe.
- Oh!
- Ah!
- Hold on now,
let's get something clear.
That was for the challenge.
Baby, I ain't never wore none
of y'all's stuff on the runway.
I ain't never had to,
and I never will.
- Girl, if you had as much
energy in your orgasm yesterday
as you got right now,
we would have been fine.
- Ooh!
- Coco thinks she's smart.
I think it's a part of Coco's
character to take low blows.
When all the pageant stuff
went down,
she did the same thing.
- Are you scared going into
this runway?
- I feel confident
with my look today
because it's a clear concept
from head to toe.
I'm gonna do<i> Dia de los Muertos.</i>
I'm gonna do skeleton makeup.
- Jinkx Monsoon,
the buffoon.
What are you thinking, girl?
You're going out there
as Skeletor?
One judge did say,
I think it was Michelle,
that you're kind of costume-y.
- I really want to wear
this costume.
- But it's a risk.
- If it doesn't land,
it's like me telling jokes.
Then it was,
it was a complete miss.
- Are you single right now?
- I started trying to, like,
kind of date a little bit.
- Yeah.
- Afterwards, um--
Opening up about my ex-boyfriend
is still really difficult.
Our relationship
was so tumultuous,
especially towards the end.
When I ended up trying
to break up with him,
he got really crazy
and started stalking me,
and was, like,
threatening my life
and, like, telling me...
- What?
- He was gonna find me.
Then, two weeks later,
he was dead, so--
You know, I saw the body.
I got to the house,
and there he was.
[somber music]
there's not a day that goes by
that I don't think about him.
But it was tough, girl.
It was so hard.
- I just want you to know
that I always will love you,
okay?
- Letting Roxxxy know a little
bit more about it was nice,
because I've never gone
to a therapist.
I've never really talked
to anybody about
the way that I feel.
And I think this experience
is just bringing Roxxxy
and I closer together.
-<i> Coming up...</i>
- I have no freakin' clue
what you said in that novela.
- I don't get it.
I don't get
what it's supposed to be.
- [laughing]
- [laughing]
[dramatic music]
- [laughing]
[RuPaul's<i> Cover Girl]</i>
Welcome to the main stage
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
Michelle Visage.
<i>Hola, mama.</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
- Hola, mi corazon.
- Shake the dice
and steal the rice and beans.
Santino.
- Ya tu sabes.
- Ay caramba,
it's Maria Conchita Alonso.
You look gorgeous.
- Gracias.
- And a sexy señorita
who's no stranger
to primetime drama.
From<i> Guys with Kids,</i>
Jamie-Lynn Sigler.
You look so pretty tonight.
- Not as pretty as you.
- This week,
our queens were challenged
to deliver the drama
in two telenovelas.
And tonight,
they're ready to make us gag
on their<i> Latina glamorosa</i>
<i>eleganza.</i>
Gentlemen,
start your engines,
and may the best woman win.
[RuPaul's<i> I Bring the Beat]</i>
- Up first, Detox.
I'm bullish on that look.
- I'm serving up
mariachi realness.
Oh,<i> ay, dios mios.</i>
[shouts<i> el grito]</i>
- [laughing]
I bet she's got
some cock-and-bull story.
Roxxxy Andrews.
Check out those<i> chichis.</i>
- Hey, I'm the only Latina left.
I have to represent.
- I can see
her coochie-coochie.
- Okay.
- The 49th state, Alaska.
- Ay, caramba.
- I'm shaking my maracas.
I bought cha-cha heels for
Christmas.
- I got to teach you
how to play the maracas.
- [laughs]
- Mucho muchacha.
Alyssa Edwards.
- Very dramatic, huh?
- She's a Spanish fly girl.
- Um, tonight,
I'm serving Latin fish drama.
- Look at that legwork.
- Yes.
- Hyperextension.
- Serving Tex-Mex.
Coco Montrese.
- Ooh.
- Loco for Coco.
- I'm giving the judges Dorothy
Dandridge Latina glamour, baby.
- Her name was Lola Falana.
- Lola, do you wanna?
- Jinkx Monsoon.
[gasps]
- Drag of the dead.
- I feel fan-fucking-tastic.
Looking spooky and sexy
all at the same time.
- You know, Jinkx is like
all the other supermodels,
just skin and bones.
- [laughs] Yes.
- Buenas noches, ladies.
Let's take a look
at your telenovelas.
First up,<i> Ella No Es Dama.</i>
[melodramatic music]
- We must determine
which one of us killed him.
- [gasps]
[gasps]
- [gasps]
[all gasping]
- I couldn't kill him.
I gave him my virginity!
- [gasps]
- [gasps]
- And...
I'm carrying his baby.
- Ah!
Agh!
Diego loved me.
- [gasps]
- He didn't mind
that I was old.
And I am carrying his baby.
Agh!
- How could Diego love you,
when he loved me?
And I am carrying his baby<i> dos.</i>
- [gasps]
- There is only one thing left
for us to do.
Bring us the poison.
- [gasps]
- All:<i> Vaya con dios.</i>
- [sobbing]
- All: [choking]
[gasp]
[choking]
[gasp]
[exhale]
[ominous music]
- So stupid.
- You're telling me.
- Oh, my brother.
The beautiful drag queen.
- [grunting]
-<i> No eres una dama.</i>
- I've been working here
five years.
You'd think they'd notice this
Adam's apple from now, huh?
We will now be very rich.
<i>Muy rico!</i>
- Both: [laugh evilly]
[laughter and applause]
- Next up,<i> Casa de Locas.</i>
[peaceful guitar music]
- I have bad news.
Hilda...
get out, you ugly, stupid maid.
Maria, you have a rare,
fatal condition.
- Oh!
- If you hear the names of food,
you will orgasm so violently
that you will...
die.
I have the same disease.
- [gasps]
[screaming]
Nooo!
[normal voice]
Now that you mention it,
we never talk about food.
- [laughing]
[ominous music]
It is I who put the curse on
<i>la casa de locas.</i>
- [gasps]
- [hisses]
Hilda!
You are<i> muy estupida</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
if you think you are going to
take over our<i> familia!</i>
- Chimichanga!
[Alyssa and Jinkx moaning]
<i>Si, si!</i>
<i>Y...</i><span style="bodyStyle"> fish taco!</i>
[Alyssa and Jinkx moaning]
- No!
- Yes!
- No!
- Yes!
[chokes]
- [gasping]
- Is Maria or<i> su madre</i><span style="bodyStyle"> here?</i>
-<i> No estan aqui.</i>
Maybe I can help you
with something?
- Would you like to have dinner
with me?
- I thought you'd never ask.
- [laughs awkwardly]
[scattered applause]
- Now, this week you've worked
in groups.
But tonight, you'll be judged
as individuals.
It's time for
the judges' critiques.
<i>Coming up...</i>
- I think you were intimidated.
- That dress is probably
one of the worst I've ever seen
in five seasons.
- [laughing]
- [laughing]
All right, it's time
for the judges' critiques.
Starting with...Detox.
- I'm not sure about
the sombrero.
It's so campy,
and the outfit is so not.
- On to the telenovela.
I think the villain has to have
the biggest presence,
so I wanted you to just have
something a little bit greater.
- Next up, Roxxxy Andrews.
- Tonight on the runway,
your makeup looks amazing.
More so than ever before.
- This is the least amount
of makeup I've worn ever.
- [laughs]
- You look stunning.
- Thank you so much.
- And the telenovela,
from the way you moved your body
to your high-pitched voice,
the way you moved your head
when you got slapped.
You took that role, and you did
great things with it,
and I was really impressed.
- Up next, Alaska.
- Hi.
- Tonight on the runway,
you gave us another upbeat walk,
and it works for you.
- Cruella de Vil.
That's what I saw
when you were acting,
which you did a very good job.
- I think you're really,
really gifted.
I could take notes from you,
for sure.
- Thank you.
- Up next, Alyssa Edwards.
- Alyssa,
I have no freakin' clue
what you said in that novela.
- [gasps]
- You turned into Dracula
a few times.
I was like, what?
- Tonight, that dress
is probably one of the worst
dresses I've ever seen
on this runway in five seasons.
It is such a mess.
I don't get it.
I don't get what
it's supposed to be.
- Okay, when you go
to the clubs,
every single,
each and every night,
you don't ask the girls,
"Did you sew that?
"Did you make that?
Were you funny the other night
to get here?"
But if you say tonight,
lip sync for your life,
I'm gonna lip sync for my life,
and if I'm able to stay,
I'll do it every damn week
because I am an entertainer.
- Alyssa, every last one of
these girls
are amazing performers.
- I didn't discredit nobody.
- It comes across as if,
"I'm the best entertainer
up here,
"and if I have to lip sync
for my life every night,
I'll lip sync my way
all the way to the crown."
That's not what this is about.
- Alyssa,
we know you got it.
Your characteristics are funny,
you're beautiful,
you have the total package.
I'm just not sure if you know
how to connect the pieces.
You know?
- Thank you.
- All right.
Thanks, Alyssa.
Next up, Jinkx Monsoon.
- Um...
you confuse me sometimes.
And that's a good thing.
- [laughs]
- Keep me on my damn toes.
- I was really shocked
by your outfit tonight,
but I love it.
I think it's really fun.
- In the telenovela,
you were perfection.
Your change of emotion
on a dime
to you humping the couch
when you were having
your orgasm.
- [moaning]
[gasping]
[squeals]
You did the best orgasm!
- [laughing]
- Next up, Coco Montrese.
- Hi, Ru.
- Your look tonight
on the runway, I love it.
It's a beautiful mango color.
You worked that jumpsuit.
Great choice.
In the telenovela,
I was left wanting more.
- I think you were
a little bit intimidated
when you got next to Wilmer.
- Thank you, ladies.
I think we've heard enough.
While you enjoy
an Absolut cocktail
in the Interior Illusions
Lounge,
the judges and I
will deliberate.
You may leave the stage.
All right,
just between us<i> chicas,</i>
what do you think?
Let's start with Detox.
- Tonight on the runway,
this really wasn't Detox's
best effort.
And I expect more from her.
- Well, she slapped very good.
[laughs]
- Which is very important
in a telenovela.
- Yes.
- She was funny-ish
with baby<i> dos</i>
but could have been
so much bigger.
Like, that was
a wasted opportunity.
- Roxxxy Andrews.
- She looked so pretty
with that black hair,
and her makeup looked gorgeous.
And her body shape
with the cinch waist.
She just melted my loins.
- Well, I loved seeing her
cinched in like that.
And the hair, and she drew on
the Latin curls.
- Oh, on the face.
That's so cute.
Yeah.
And in the telenovela.
- She was strong.
Everything she did,
the physicality,
her voice, the pitch.
She stood out.
- Roxxxy redeemed herself
this week
from the past two weeks
of kind of letting us down.
- Alaska.
- Ella No Es Dama really was
the better of the two
telenovelas because of Alaska.
- It was a very layered
performance.
She's a gifted comedian.
- Tonight on the runway,
the dress looked really cheap.
But she gave us
a little more ass.
- Yes.
- And you like that.
- Hell, yeah, I like more ass.
[laughter]
- Alyssa Edwards.
What did you think of her outfit
on the runway?
- Whoever made that for her
is fired.
- Thanks a lot, Grandma.
- [laughing]
- And what'd you think of her
in the telenovela?
- That role could have been
so, so big and funny,
because she's so intriguing
to me.
- How is it that
she doesn't know
how to ham it up
in front of a camera?
- She doesn't know
what she's got.
- She was already talking about,
like,
having to lip sync for her life
tonight.
- If that inner dialogue
is saying,
you know,
"I'm gonna fail at this
or I'm not any good at this,"
well, hello,
that's what you get, you know.
- Yes.
- Jinkxy Monsoon.
- She is a very good actress.
She's beautiful.
She's funny.
- She took that script,
and she made it her own.
- That takes a really talented
person to be able to do that.
- She looked flawless
in that telenovela.
- Yeah.
- The<i> Dia de los Muertos.</i>
It was shocking.
I think she looked fierce
the way she did it.
- I loved the<i> cojones</i>
it took to do that,
and it really did
catch me by surprise.
Coco Montrese.
- I thought she looked gorgeous.
I mean, this is her color,
the shape,
even the cheapish flowers.
In the novela, there were a lot
of weird choices
and missed opportunities.
A lot of literal acting out,
which is, like, cardinal sin
number one.
- I wanted her to stand out
so much more.
It felt as if her role
was insignificant
until the end
when you realized what it was,
and then you just wished
that it was more than that.
- Silence.
I've made my decision.
Bring back my girls.
- [laughing]
- [laughing]
Welcome back, ladies.
I've made some decisions.
Roxxxy Andrews,
as Teresa the virgin,
you really gave it up.
You're safe.
- Alaska...
you're safe.
- Thank you.
- Jinkx Monsoon,
this week, you came,
you saw...
and you came again.
You're the winner
of this week's challenge.
[applause]
- Thank you.
- You've won a pair
of faux fur coats
from Fabulous-Furs.
- It's<i> muy magnifico.</i>
I am the first one
to win two challenges
in this competition.
- Alyssa Edwards,
your performance
in the telenovela
did not have us screaming
in ecstasy.
I'm sorry, my dear, but you are
up for elimination.
- [sighs]
- Coco Montrese,
as Hilda the maid,
you were a little...
dusty.
Detox, as Consuela the maid,
you...
didn't clean up.
Coco Montrese...
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
- Ooh.
[tense music]
- Detox, you may join
the other girls.
Two queens stand before me.
Ladies,
this is your last chance
to impress me
and save yourself
from elimination.
The time has come for you
to lip sync for your life.
- From the first day
I walked into the workroom
and I saw her face,
I wanted to step on that stage
across from her
and get vindication.
- After all the drama with
our last pageant experience,
we both want this crown.
This will be the tiebreaker.
- Good luck,
and don't fuck it up.
- I'm making sure the judges
see every word
that's coming out of my mouth,
as if I was Paula Abdul herself.
- That spinning jump
into the split?
I mean, come on.
- Coco's spinning
very beautiful.
Her outfit works perfectly
for the dance moves.
Miss thing, she is everything.
- [laughing]
- The lip sync is jaw-dropping.
It's gonna be neck and neck.
[cheers and applause]
- [howls]
- Wow.
Ladies...
I've made my decision.
Coco Montrese...
shantay, you stay.
- [exhales heavily]
Coco, you may join
the other girls.
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.
- [inaudible]
- [sighs]
- Alyssa Edwards,
the next time you look
in the mirror,
I hope you see what I see--
a triple threat.
A dancer,
a beauty queen,
and one fierce-ass
"entertainter".
Now, sashay away.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
[applause]
Deuces.
I cannot say
that I'm heartbroken,
because I gave it my all.
And to say that
I am in the top six
of America's finest
in this art form
is a privilege,
and it's an honor.
Always and forever...
[echoing]
Alyssa Edwards!
- Condragulations,
my ferocious five.
Now, remember,
if you can't love yourself,
how in the hell you gonna love
somebody else?
Can I get an amen up in here?
- All: Amen.
- Let the music play.
[RuPaul's<i> The Beginning]</i>


-<i> Previously</i>
<i>on</i><span style="bodyStyle"> RuPaul's Drag Race...</i>
You'll be competing
in the RuPaul roast.
- Ru, you're acting to me, um--
[clears throat]
- What do you call it
when you flatline?
- Fuck.
- I'm not acting when I say
I'm insecure about things.
- It's all bullshit.
- Girl, you look like
the black Pee-wee Herman.
[laughter]
- RuPaul's next...
[microphone feedback]
Drag queen of the year--
[microphone feedback]
- Coco Montrese,
you are the winner
of this week's challenge.
Condragulations.
- [cries]
- What's going on?
- My mother
left my sister and myself
at a bus stop when I was three.
It just hurt that I was left.
- As gay people,
we get to choose our family.
We are family here.
What you two did on this runway
is the passion I am looking for.
Shante, you both stay.
- Oh, my god, my god, my god.
My god.
- Oh. Are we all a mess?
- So we're walking
back into the workroom,
and I just finished
having the breakdown of my life.
I know y'all don't understand
what I was saying
'cause I was crying so much,
but it all just hit me.
I have never cried
about being left by my mom.
- Ever?
- Ever!
I was left at a bus stop
by my real mother,
and I was sent to an orphanage.
I've always felt rejection.
Part of me comes off
as such a strong character.
You know, like
when y'all were reading me,
you and Jade and stuff like--
that comes from being rejected.
The way I tend
to react to rejection
is getting very angry.
I was angry, and the easiest
target was Jinkx.
I totally took it out on her.
And that's not fair.
And Jinkx, I'm sorry.
- After seeing what Roxxxy
went through tonight,
I can't stay mad at her,
you know.
We have all been through so much
shit in our lives.
- Roxxxy Andrews is my sister,
and I'm so happy
that she's still here.
But it's still top seven
and not top six.
And I know I'm annoyed.
And I think a lot
of other girls are annoyed.
- This has been rough
fucking day.
I still am the one queen
who hasn't won a challenge.
- I can't believe I got it
with you two in the room.
What the hell?
The two comedy queens of
oh, my god.
I won?
What happened
to the funny girls?
Jinkx, Alaska.
- I just really
want to win a challenge.
- This was a challenge
right up your alley.
Do you feel, like, Coco,
you know--
- These other queens don't think
that I'm a force
to be reckoned with.
Good.
It's called a sneak attack.
I'ma get you, girl.

[tires screeching]
- Oh, girl.
- Whoo.
[overlapping chatter]
- Today, I'm feeling
a little on edge.
Me and Roxxxy
both are still here.
But I think that the girls
wanted one of us to go home.
- Finally, the top six.
Oh, wait.
- [laughs]
- Nope. Alyssa's still here.
- Aw, man.
[siren wails]
all: Ooh!
- Ooh, girl, you got shemail.
Hey, ladies.
Can you smell me?
Mm.
It's the sweet
smell of success.
Remember,
America's next drag superstar
needs to follow her nose
wherever it goes.
Good luck.
And don't funk it up.
- What?
- Smell?
- Hello, hello, hello.
- Hello.
- Now at this point in the race,
you must be getting
a little homesick
or lonely for boyfriends
or just miss having
a little sexy fun.
- [chuckles]
- Well, I have just the remedy.
Oh, pit crew.
- Oh!
- Come on.
[all cheering]
- Mmm.
- What?
- What?
- What the hell?
[squeals]
- [wolf whistle]
- Oh, my god, it doesn't stop.
- Oh.
- Say hello to designer
Andrew Christian.
Andrew, thank you
for keeping the pit crew
looking so hot all season.
- I'm very dedicated to my work.
- I bet you are.
Now, ladies,
Andrew has brought his models
to play a little game
of whatcha packin'?
-<i> You know</i>
<i>what I'm talking about.</i>
- [laughs]
- You ask a model to drop trou
and reveal
his Andrew Christians.
- Oh!
- Your job is
to find the matching pair.
[laughter]
Now, the queen that makes all
the matches the fastest wins.
- Oh, my god.
- First up, Ivy Winters.
- [laughs]
- The rest of you,
wait outside for your turn.
All right, Ivy, choose a model.
- Number 9.
[laughs]
- Oh.
- 14, please.
[buzzer]
- Not a match.
Next pick.
- Number 10.
- Damn.
You're gonna put somebody's
eyes out with that thing.
- 18.
[ding]
- We got a match.
How did we end up
in the meatpacking district?
- [laughs]
- Number 6.
both: Red.
- Now wait a minute.
- Wait. Oh, no.
I forgot what one was red.
- [laughs]
- I'm so distracted.
[laughs]
I am trying to memorize what boy
has got what underwear on.
And at the same time,
I'm just thinking,
god, this guy's really hot.
- Pick a model.
- 22.
- Ooh, pretty in pink.
- Oh, my god.
[shrieks]
I could play this game all day.
- It's like the Rockettes
only a lot more cock.
- 6.
9.
- Not a match.
- 11.
21.
[buzzer]
- No match.
- I was so close.
- I know,
you were about this close.
[laughter]
- 2 and 5.
[buzzer]
Son of a bitch.
17.
- Ooh.
- Oh.
- Seen that color before
somewhere.
- 8.
[buzzer]
Oh, wait.
Son of a bitch.
- Oh, damn it.
- Take them the fuck off.
I've had it.
- [laughs]
- Number 6 and number 7.
[buzzer]
- Ooh, not a match.
Alyssa, you're not doing
very well here.
- No, I'm doing very well.
I'm just not making any matches.
- Exactly, exactly.
- 15 and 7.
[ding]
- We got a match.
I don't know why
but I'm craving a corn dog.
The winner of today's
mini challenge is...
every straight woman
and gay man in America.
[laughter]
But one of you de-pants
these boys in record time.
The winner is...
Ivy Winters!
- [laughs]
Yay.
[laughs]
- You've won a phone call home.
- [gasps]
- Oh.
- I'm so happy I won
the mini challenge.
I'll be able to call my mom.
- Ladies, you know
you've reached the height
of superstardom when you have
your own fragrance.
For this week's main challenge,
you'll be creating and marketing
your own signature fragrance.
- [gasps]
- You'll come up with the scent,
a name, a package, and then
film your own commercial.
Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best woman...
[magical tone]
Win.
- Damn it, I wanted that.
You cunt.
- I'm so excited.
We've been doing
comedy after comedy.
A perfume ad
is something that me,
a pageant girl,
would like to do.
[bottles clatter]
- [gasps]
- Shit.
- How many did she--
drops did she say goes in?
- It depends on how you make it.
- Alyssa doesn't even
notice that
she's knocked a whole
bottle of oil all over me.
Yeah, I got to start over again.
Alyssa just doesn't think
past her own wig.
You know, it's all about Alyssa.
And it's pissing me off.
- My fragrance
is called Ruanimale.
- Does it smell like me
or does it smell like you?
- It smells like food
and maple and--
- Yeah, it smells like IHOP.
[laughs]
- [laughs]
- For the main challenge,
we have to create a scent...
- Ugh.
[coughs]
- Design a slogan,
the perfume bottle,
and shoot a commercial.
- Does everyone have an idea
of where you want to go?
- Kind of.
I think I've got like
a general idea.
- And what are you
gonna call it?
- Ivy winter's Poison Rosebud.
- [laughs]
That's cute.
- I've always been interested
in making my own perfume.
I've thought about
going to school for it.
I think I'm creative enough
to come up with
a really delicious perfume.
- Oh, it's so good,
I just want to
spray it all over my body
right now.
- [laughs]
- I haven't won a challenge yet,
so it's do or die.
I'm taking my gut reaction
and just running
straight forward with it.
Did somebody get fresh dirt?
I'm using things like dirt,
leather--
earthy and dirty,
which is totally my brand.
Oh, my god.
I love it.
- Mm, what you got going on?
- It's gonna start
like it's the morning after.
- Yeah.
- And have the pit crew
and me, like,
laying on a sofa or something
as if we had a threesome.
- That's a cute idea.
- I've been told continuously
in this competition,
"Girl, I don't get you."
But there's one person
who always gets who I am
and what I'm doing.
And it's Ivy.
- What about you?
- I'm doing a poison rosebud.
[both laugh]
- You know, a rosebud
is a synonym for asshole.
- I know,
that's why I'm using it.
- Just checking.
- Jinkx is amazing.
I feel like
I can relate to her a lot,
and the other girls
are totally threatened,
so that's why they're
all kind of nitpicking at her.
- Any help from me at all,
just let me know.
- Okay, honey.
I got to get back
to my rosebuds.
- Go prune the roses.
- [laughs]
- Hello, hello, hello.
- Hi, Ru.
- How are my little stinkers
doing?
[laughter]
- Alaska.
- Hi.
- Is your fragrance gonna
represent Alaska?
- It is.
It smells delicious,
but it's also a little weird.
- Huh.
- Do you want to smell it?
- Yeah, I would love
to smell it.
It's not gonna make me sick,
is it?
- Well, I hope not.
You're the first guinea pig,
so--
- [inhales deeply]
[groaning]
Ooh, yeah, yeah, ooh, yeah,
yeah.
- My fragrance is called Red.
- Has Red been used before?
- Oh.
I think he's right.
Which means
I have to make up a tagline.
- All right, Alaska.
Good luck, and I can't wait
to smell you.
- Thank you, Ru.
- All right.
- Roxxxy Andrews.
Look at that bottle.
- Hi, Ru.
- What's the name
of your fragrance?
- My name of my fragrance
is Thick &amp; Juicy.
- Oh, my goodness.
- It's all about confidence.
And you have to embrace
and love yourself.
And like I told you guys,
I've embraced myself
with how I look,
and I want to
share that with everybody.
And wearing this is gonna
help you get confidence.
- Can I smell it?
- The smell is delicious.
It smells like food and maple
and jasmine at the same time.
- Oh, my goodness, yes.
It smells like IHOP.
Ooh, your country breakfast
is ready.
Y'all hungry?
Listen, you have
a lot of work to do here
'cause you know,
you were in the bottom two
last week,
so this has really
got to pop for you.
I'll see you then.
- Okay.
- All right.
Hey, Coco.
- Hi, Ru.
- Tell me about your fragrance.
- My fragrance is called
Ruanimale by Coco.
- Ooh.
Does it smell like me
or does it smell like you?
- It smells like me.
- Do you think the title
is a little confusing
for the consumer?
- No, because it says
Ruanimale by Coco.
- Ru is a little concerned
about the name.
But every perfume line
has a spokesperson.
- Okay, all right.
I'll have to check
with my lawyer.
I can't wait
to see the campaign.
See ya.
Alyssa Edwards.
- Hello, Ru.
- This sounds like a challenge
right up your alley.
- Something like that.
[laughs]
- Okay, tell me about your
fragrance.
- My fragrance is called
Alyssa's Secret.
- What is Alyssa's Secret?
- Um--
Son of a bitch.
Well, my secret to what?
- Here's Alyssa's secret,
darling.
The secret is, she don't know
what the fuck she's doing.
Here's the secret.
You can't tell Alyssa anything.
Here's a secret.
You can't get Alyssa
in front of a mirror
without taking four hours.
I've had it.
- I would have to really think
what my secret is,
because I wanted the secret
to be left for the imagination.
Ru is definitely not buying
what I'm trying to sell,
so this concerns me.
- Clarify your message, okay?
- Thank you.
Okay.
- Ivy Winters.
- Hi.
- Tell me about your fragrance.
- My fragrance is called
Ivy Winters' Poisoned Rosebud.
- Wow, that's a mouthful.
What are you
patterning it after?
- I really wanted to be able
to give women confidence,
to be classy, to be powerful.
- Well, that sounds like
a lot of fragrances.
- That is a lot of fragrances,
yeah.
- As this performer, you have
to be a marketing person too.
And actually break it down,
like, who is Ivy Winters?
And you think, okay.
You put together outfits.
You think, the circus performer.
You think of wacky, young.
But what I'm hearing is,
you're designing this
for a woman 45 and older.
- I completely missed the mark
with this rosebud.
Talking to you, I realize that
this is not really me.
Oh, what am I doing, Ivy?
I gotta get it together.
I'm just, like, thinking,
like, crazy.
I gotta make it happen.
Make it work.
- All right, listen up, ladies.
In a moment, you'll be shooting
your perfume commercials.
You'll be directed
by Michelle Visage
and our extra special
guest judge,
the enterprising singer
Aubrey O'Day.
- [gasps]
Yay.
- What?
- And this week
on the main stage,
come dressed
for your fragrance launch,
where we'll be joined by
one of my absolute favorites,
Joan Van Ark.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Ladies,
I expect you to come out
smelling like a rose.
So don't fuck it up.
- Remember it's perfume.
- I feel like I'm watching<i> </i>
<i>The Lion King</i><span style="bodyStyle"> right now.</i>
- [laughs]
[lion roars]
- [laughs]
- [laughs]
- Jinkx Monsoon.
-<i> Guten morgen.</i>
This week's main challenge
is to create a perfume
and star in a commercial.
- Hi, love.
Meet Aubrey O'Day.
- Hi.
- All right, boys.
You guys are asleep
the whole time.
Which just had a kinky
three-way.
Eiffel tower, all that stuff.
My perfume is Delusion
by Jinkx Monsoon.
Does this look like we had sex?
- Looks like something.
Action.
[laid-back music]
- Her legs are really open
for selling perfume.
- Cut.
Remember it's perfume,
not a dildo ad.
So you might want to
take it down just a notch.
- Okay.
- Action.
- Nothing about her
felt like a lady.
Her legs were spread open,
her arms were awkward.
It felt kind of messy.
You look like this.
- Show me, show me, Aubrey.
- Hold on, let me just do
a couple--a little bit longer.
[laughter]
Something like this.
- Ivy Winters.
- Hello.
- Can we see your background
palette thingy?
- New York city.
- Oh, New York City.
Okay, home for you, yeah?
- Home for me.
- Uh, you know that's Tokyo.
- Oh, is it?
[laughs]
Dress Code for the glamorous
girl on the go.
- And cut.
There's a lot of jerking around,
a lot of movement.
- You're gritting your teeth
a lot
when you're
doing your sexy face,
like you have to go
to the bathroom or something.
- And action.
- Dress Code by Ivy Winters.
The smell
that changes your style.
- Cut.
- Remember it's scent,
not smell.
- Not only does it--
not only--excuse me.
Aubrey O'Day, her eyes are
a little intimidating.
- Feel it, girl.
- Ivy Winters, Dress Code.
Oh, shit.
Sorry.
- What's the name
of your fragrance, Coco?
- Ruanimale by Coco.
- Blue animale?
- Ru.
- Boo?
- Ru.
- Ruanimale?
- Ruanimale.
Yes.
- And you're wearing leopard
and you're performing
in front of leopard.
- Yeah.
- Coco--damn,
she gave me a headache.
There was so much leopard
happening.
The outfit, the hair--
it felt like a bad, cheesy porn.
- Ruanimale by Coco.
The wild exotic essence
of a woman.
[lion snarls]
- Cut.
- You have so much going on,
especially with your background.
So I would try your hardest
to keep your face
as soft as you can.
- Because everything else
is gonna be so animale.
- Yeah.
- Action.
[lion snarling]
- I feel like I'm watching
<i>The Lion King</i><span style="bodyStyle"> right now.</i>
- [laughs]
[elephant trumpets]
- I just don't know how well
she's gonna be able to recover
from all that leopard.
- It's Detox.
- Hi.
- First of all, what's the name
of your scent?
- Heroine.
- Hmm.
- It's kind of a double entendre
of the drug heroin
because my name is Detox
and a heroine,
which is a really strong
female figure.
And I feel like I embody
all of that.
- And action.
- Detox.
[whispers]
Sexy.
[deep voice]
Heroine.
[whispers]
Seductive.
[deep voice]
Heroine.
[whispers]
Get high.
[inhales]
Ah.
- [giggles]
- And cut.
- I don't think whispering
always means sexy.
- Mm-hmm.
- It's trying too hard.
Just mean the word.
- Okay.
- Detox is beautiful,
tall, great hair,
but I don't really
remember the commercial at all.
- Alyssa Edwards.
Action.
- Every woman has a secret.
Mine happens to be
a little bigger.
- Wha--what did you say?
- [laughs]
Oh, girl.
My secret--
[laughs]
I'm a man.
[laughs]
A scent sophisticated
for the everyday woman,
yet strong enough
for the career lady.
- And cut.
- You're real hard right now.
Make me like you.
Right now I'm like, ugh.
She's real pretty,
but her personality is crazy.
- Every woman has a secret.
Um...
uh, what was my next line?
Oh, let me start again.
Sorry.
I just feel so damn tense.
- You look it.
- I can talk to people
all day long,
but the minute someone says,
"Here are the lines,
say it," game over.
- Roxxxy Andrews.
- Hi.
- So, what's the name
of your scent?
- My scent, just like me,
is Thick &amp; Juicy.
- Action.
- Thick &amp; Juicy,
for the girls that are a little
thick and juicy.
And it smells just like food.
- Cut.
- Okay, we're gonna
do that again.
- [inhales]
Mmm. And tastes
just like my favorite foods.
Maple, chocolate,
and a little bit of everything.
- Cut.
- And smells
just like maple syrup,
chocolate, and watermelon.
- Cut.
I feel like you're making up
your words.
What did you plan to say, Rox?
- I planned to say that
it smells so good
you can eat it,
but then I was, like, "Hold on.
Perfume, you can't eat it."
- Okay.
So, you ended up with,
"I don't know"?
All right.
- Hi, Alaska.
Tell us the name of your scent.
- Red for filth.
- Oh, work!
- Okay, do you have any modeling
or scene work or anything?
- For dangerous, flawless,
seductive, and overpriced.
She's gonna be,
like, turning around and,
like, catching the camera.
And then it cross-fades.
And then turn around.
- Girl.
- Let's do this.
All right.
- Seductive.
Overpriced.
Those all look kind of the same.
- Uh-huh.
- Maybe you should just do it
one right after the other
like Wonder Woman.
Just keep spinning.
- Okay.
- And don't stop.
Dangerous.
Spin!
Seductive!
Overpriced!
[laughter]
- I love Red to filth.
She knew exactly
what she wanted to do,
and she took control.
And at the end of the day,
that's more impressive
than any win you can get.
- I think we've got it.
- Okay.
- That's a wrap, Ms. Alaska.
- Thank you, guys.
- Good job.
- Can I open up to you about
something?
- Mm-hmm.
- I have a crush on Ivy Winters.
- [gasps]
- I love you.
[crying]
- [laughs]
- [laughs]
[overlapping chatter]
- Here we are, again.
Today is elimination day.
And like usual,
I'm scrambling around
and trying to get a really good
runway look together.
I'm going through my suitcases,
and I completely forgot that
I packed this photo book.
I have to show you guys
something.
This is my friend Caldwell's
photo book
chronicling the House of Haute.
- Oh, how much fun is that.
- Oh, my gosh, how neat.
Are you really onstage naked?
- Girl, we do some shit, girl.
With all of, like,
my family and my friends.
That's in the airport
the day Sharon came back
from<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
Getting to, like, see this book
that I totally forgot
that I had,
was like a huge,
like, shot in the arm.
[crying]
It was just so, like,
encouraging.
And it just makes me feel
renewed completely.
- I won the mini challenge,
and my prize
is getting to call to my mom.
Hi.
I'm so happy.
[laughs]
- I'm just so happy
to see your face.
[laughter]
- Seeing all the girls having
such tragic stories
with their families,
it made me really start thinking
about how special
you guys are to me.
- Aww.
- And I'm so blessed
to have such an amazing family.
- Yeah.
[laughing, crying]
When I was little,
I did a lot of theater,
and I was always nervous.
And she'd always,
like, squeeze my hand,
just to let me know
that everything
was gonna be all right.
And you know, she's proud of me.
Hmm.
I love you.
- Bye-bye.
- Mwah.
- Can I open up to you
about something?
- Mm-hmm.
- I have a crush on Ivy Winters.
- [gasps]
- I definitely can sense
those kind of feelings
bubbling up.
My biggest fear
is that this is gonna be done,
and she's gonna go back
to New York.
And I'm gonna
go back to Seattle,
and I'm gonna be like, "mm."
[snorts]
- You little scamp, you.
- I don't want to lose my head
or anything.
- Well, you know, that's cute.
- I don't know
how to describe it in words
how much Ivy means to me.
I almost think
that this could be
the beginning
of a relationship.
I'm really excited about that.
- Ivy.
- How was it, Ivy?
- It was so special.
- Oh.
- [laughing]
[upbeat music]
Welcome to the main stage
of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
Michelle Visage.
- My citrus queen.
- [laughs]
- Shake the old spice
and steal the rice.
It's Santino.
- These have always
brought me luck.
- [laughs]
Joan Van Ark,
I am so thrilled you're here.
- You look like
a hot dream-sicle.
- [laughs]
And Aubrey O'Day.
Did my girls
pass the smell test?
- Some of them did.
Some of them didn't.
- Oh, my goodness.
This week,
we challenged our queens
to create their own
signature fragrances.
And tonight,
they're ready to mark the runway
with the scent of a drag queen.
Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best woman win.
[upbeat music]
- First up, Coco Montrese.
Panther on the runway.
- Zebra on the runway.
- Okay.
- I'm serving animalistic
evening gown down.
I feel exquisite.
- I almost wore that outfit.
- [laughs]
- Up next, Alaska.
Lady in red.
A head for business
and a body for sin.
- Yes.
- I'm giving
crazy red executive dreams.
If this look
isn't changing it up,
I'm not really sure what is.
- I own 51% of this company.
- [laughs]
- Ivy Winters.
- The flounce and the bounce.
- I'm trying to move
as much as possible,
so every little
sparkly rhinestone
just twinkles in their eye.
[laughs]
- She's a Ziegfeld girl.
- Is she getting too old
for that whorey look?
[laughter]
- You're never too old for that.
- No.
- Detox.
- Ooh.
- High fa-shi-on.
- Oh, yeah.
- I see London, I see France.
- You can't fucking
take this body.
You have no choice but to get up
into my cakes and my lingerie
and love every little bit of it.
- Between love and madness
lies Detox.
- [laughs]
- Then of course, rehab.
- Alyssa Edwards.
<i>Dallas</i><span style="bodyStyle"> meets</i><i> Dynasty</i><span style="bodyStyle"> meets</i>
<i>Knots Landing.</i>
I am giving 2013 businesswoman,
and I am living
for my gig today.
- Ah, the smell of it.
- Ah, yes.
- Does this skirt
make my damask look big?
- Mm.
- Jinkx Monsoon.
She works for MGM by day
and FOX all night.
- I am floating
down that runway,
and I am just
being cute and lovely.
- Oh.
- And 100% Jinkxy.
- No animals were harmed.
- No animals were harmed, yes.
Roxxxy Andrews, cat suit.
I could read her lips.
- [laughs]
- I turn this corner,
and they're gonna get a load
of this back.
Ow, eat it, bitch.
- Roxxxy Andrews,
the other white meat.
- She can bring home the bacon,
fry it up in a pan,
and serve it.
- There wasn't much going on,
idea-wise.
- I don't even know what you're
selling me,
but I don't want this.
- The perfume smells like
grandma's vag.
- [laughs]
- [laughs]
- Welcome, ladies.
Coco Montrese, let's see your
fragrance commercial.
- Ruanimale by Coco.
Wild.
[lion snarls]
Exotic.
Essence of a woman.
- Ooh!
- As far as the video goes,
too much leopard,
and the guy with the headpiece
makes it gimmicky.
- Tonight, probably
one too many accessories,
but I think
this dress is gorgeous.
- Next up, Alaska.
- Dangerous, flawless,
overpriced.
Whether you're getting
read the house down...
- Your makeup is terrible.
- [laughs]
- Or just ready to go down.
The exciting new fragrance.
Red for filth.
Are you red..."e" for me?
[laughter]
- Absolutely loved it.
The only thing,
when you went south,
I wanted to see a big fat smile
on his face.
- [laughs]
- Ivy Winters.
- Dress Code by Ivy Winters.
For the glamorous girl
on the go.
Not only does it smell good,
but it changes your style.
- Oh, my goodness.
- Dress code by Ivy Winters.
The scent that
changes your style.
- Oh, dear.
- There wasn't much going on,
idea-wise.
- There were a lot of
awkward moments,
and as far as
the outfit tonight,
it's ice skater-y.
You're all about a dress code.
- Detox.
- Seduction, addiction,
heroine.
- [laughs]
- Sexy, sultry.
Heroine.
- [laughs]
- The new addiction
for an addictive woman.
Available at the clinic.
[laughter]
- The commercial was so brave
and so out there.
And the voiceover part.
Bravo to you.
- Tonight, something
looks a little unfinished.
It's not quite pushing it
as far as you normally do.
- Alyssa Edwards.
- Every woman has a secret.
And my secret happens to be
a little bigger.
And what exactly is my secret?
[laughs]
Why, it's Alyssa's secret.
For the desired
and the inspired.
- I don't even know
what you're selling me,
but I don't want this.
I want to change the channel.
- You do this thing
with your eyes
and it's like this sexy,
like, open 'em
and then close 'em.
I've gotten this note
a million times
which is why I'm just
passing it your way.
Less is more
'cause it almost gets
a little serial killer-ish.
[laughter]
- Jinkx, are you all right?
- Oh, yeah.
[laughs]
I'm just saying, "Water
off a duck's back" to myself.
Um, before my critiques.
- That's a great mantra.
- Words can't hurt you.
Only your own perception
of those words.
- Let's see your
fragrance commercial.
- For the girl
who lives above her means.
For the girl
who just won't give up.
For the girl with a dream.
Delusion.
[laughs]
Convince yourself.
- [laughs]
- I thought
it was the best concept.
No tea, no shade, hunty,
but I think it's my favorite.
- I'll have what she's having.
- [laughs]
- I don't even have enough words
for how happy I am tonight
with your look.
- Thank you.
- All right, Roxxxy Andrews.
- Thick &amp; Juicy.
For the girls who are like me.
Thick &amp; Juicy.
For the girls that like to eat
and don't worry
about being petite.
[inhales]
Mmm.
- Tonight on the runway,
I'm not in love
with that bow placement
right in the front.
When you turn to the side,
it's really kind of
sticking out.
- Roxxxy is another one
who came in with not much
of a concept.
You didn't have anything
written down.
You were just kind of
winging it,
which made it different
kind of each time.
- I know it kind of
seemed confusing to you
when I kept switching my words.
- It wasn't confusing.
It was unprofessional.
- Oh.
- I think we've heard enough.
While you enjoy
an Absolut cocktail
in the Interior Illusions
Lounge,
the judges and I
will deliberate.
All right.
Just between us girls,
what do you stink?
We're gonna start
with Alyssa's secret.
Ooh.
- Right?
- It smells like
a Kardashian sex tape.
- If you ask her,
"What's your secret?"
And she's, "Well, I don't know.
I don't know."
She's not delivering her brand
and, therefore, her secret.
- Coco Montrese.
- Ruanimale is by far the worst.
- It smells like mating time
at the zoo.
- Not only is it
kissing your ass,
which I normally
don't have a problem with--
- [laughs]
- But they were supposed to be
expressing themselves
in their fragrance.
- Right.
I think her campaign,
and her in general,
is obvious, unoriginal,
and overdone.
- Ooh, okay.
- Ooh.
- Let's go next to Alaska.
- I enjoyed the commercial,
and I loved her outfit
on the runway
carrying the red theme through.
- I love the perfume.
Hers is the only one
that I would wear.
Everything else
smells like grandma's vag to me.
- [laughs]
- Dress Code by Ivy Winters.
- I think she missed everything
completely.
- I'm just clocking that bottle.
It does look like
a Christmas ornament.
And I think
it smells like something
my housekeeper used yesterday
in the bathroom.
- Or did in the bathroom.
- Oh, my goodness!
All right.
Heroine by Detox.
Joan Van Ark,
what'd you think of Detox?
And not your own
personal experiences--
- [laughs]
With it?
I don't share that with you?
Her Detox commercial I loved
because it was very brave
and upfront
and right out there.
- This week,
I wasn't feeling her look.
It looked a little homemade.
- Jinkx Monsoon's Delusion.
- She looked so beautiful
tonight.
I was so very proud of her.
- She had one of the best
commercials,
but it felt very, like,
vaudeville-y.
- All right, let's move on
to Roxxxy Andrews'
Thick &amp; Juicy.
- On the runway,
I wasn't in love with her look.
She had a bit of an open back,
but it wasn't cut out
nearly enough
to save the front of that look.
- The whole thing was tacky.
The outfit tonight was tacky.
The commercial was tacky.
I-I can't.
- [laughs]
- [claps]
Silence.
I've made my decision.
Bring back my girls.
- [laughs]
- [laughs]
- Welcome back, ladies.
I've made some decisions.
Jinkx Monsoon.
You're safe.
Detox.
You're safe.
Alaska, this week, girl,
you caused quite a stink.
Condragulations.
You're the winner
of this challenge.
- Ha ha!
- You've won a selection
of handcrafted corsets
from corsetconnection.com.
- [laughs]
I'm so happy.
I can't say this win is overdue,
but it's right on fucking time.
- Ivy Winters.
In your commercial,
your dress code
was not strictly enforced.
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
- I did not expect
to be lip-synching.
I can't believe
this is actually happening.
- Coco Montrese.
Safari, so goody.
You're safe.
- Thank you.
- Alyssa Edwards, this week
you were not as inspired
as we desired.
Roxxxy Andrews,
your Thick &amp; Juicy
was a bit too loosey-goosey.
Roxxxy Andrews...
you're safe.
You may join the other girls.
- Thank you.
- Alyssa, I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
- I'm disappointed, of course.
I don't want to be known
as being in the bottom
two times in a row.
- Two queens stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me
and save yourself
from elimination.
The time has come
for you to lip-sync
for your life.
- I have a lot to prove.
A lot is riding
on this performance.
- Good luck.
And don't fuck it up.
- I'm not gonna be meandering
all over the stage.
I want them to focus on my mouth
and hope that what I do is
better than what she's doing.
- I am giving my life.
This is my second opportunity
to give a better representation
of who Alyssa Edwards is.
- Ivy is owning
that part of the stage.
She's not moving around a lot,
but she's using
every bit of that costume.
- Alyssa is
doing her dance moves,
and she's dressed like
a businesswoman of the '80s
who doesn't want romance
without finance.
[applause]
- Ladies, I've made my decision.
Alyssa Edwards...
shante, you stay.
You may join the other girls.
Ivy, I'm going to miss
your style, grace,
and I'm going to miss saying...
Ivy Winters!
I love you, Ivy.
- I love you too.
- Now, sashay away.
- Thank you, guys, so much.
- Oh.
I'm so sad to see Ivy go.
For a while now, I feel like
she's one of the only people
who have tried
to fully understand me.
- I made amazing friends
along the way.
I'm--I'm very happy with what
I've put out to the world.
I'll miss Jinkx the most,
but we'll be
seeing each other soon.
That, I'm not worried about.
It's just so sad.
[laughs]
I'm crying because they're all
gonna miss me so damn much.
[laughs]
- My sickening six, remember,
if you can't love yourself,
how in the hell you gonna love
somebody else?
Can I get an amen in here?
all: Amen.
- All right.
Now, let the music play.
[RuPaul's<i> The Beginning]</i>- PREVIOUSLY
ON "RuPAUL'S DRAG RACE..."
I AM LAUNCHING MY FIRST-EVER
MAKEUP LINE,
AND I NEED YOU TO MARKET IT.
YOU'LL BE WORKING IN PAIRS.
- WE'RE TOO BUSY PAINTING
OUR OWN FACES INSTEAD OF THEIRS.
- A SICKENING SWEEP OF BLUSH
HELPS DISTRACT FROM
UNSIGHTLY SCARS.
- BENDELA, WE'RE HIDING
BEHIND ANOTHER COSTUME.
I HAVE NO IDEA WHO YOU ARE.
LAGANJA, THE CROTCH
IS A LITTLE LOW.
YOUR HAIR IS UNEVEN.
IT'S FLOPPING.
- WE'VE GOT, LIKE,
A LITTLE SISTER VIBE GOING.
SHE'S THE LITTLE SISTER.
- I'M THE LOW-RENT VERSION
OF COURTNEY.
- I MAY HAVE USED
THAT TERM ONCE.
- ADORE AND LAGANJA, YOU'RE THE
WINNER OF THIS WEEK'S CHALLENGE.
DARIENNE LAKE, SHANTE, YOU STAY.
BENDELACREME, YOUR TIME HERE
IS NOT OVER.
SHANTE, YOU STAY.
- YEAH.
- WHOO-OO!
- OH, WHEW.
- WELL, THAT WAS SOMETHING.
I'M GLAD WE DIDN'T HAVE
TO GO HOME.
- ME, TOO.
I HAVE NO WORDS.
I'M SO SCARED THAT I CAME
THAT CLOSE TO LEAVING SO SOON.
[SIGHS]
WELL, I THANK EVERYONE
WHO GASPED IN THE BACKGROUND
WHEN I DIDN'T LOOK LIKE
I WAS STAYING.
APPRECIATED THAT.
- I WAS GONNA CAUSE A RIOT
IF SHE SENT YOU HOME.
I WAS LIKE, "NO,
YOU'VE MADE THE WRONG DECISION."
[RECORD SCRATCHES]
- ARE YOU NOT GONNA CONGRATULATE
ADORE AND I?
DO YOU THINK THAT WE DIDN'T
DESERVE TO WIN AS A TEAM?
- I DIDN'T THINK THAT
YOU SHOULD HAVE WON.
- I'M SURE MANY
OF MY COMPETITORS
FELT THAT ADORE CARRIED ME
FOR THIS WIN,
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY,
SHE'S STANDING
IN AN '80s SWEATER
AND A SKIRT FROM FOREVER 21,
AND I SPENT A LOT OF TIME
ON MY LOOK.
- PARTY.
- JOSLYN, I MEAN,
YOU'RE BEING VERY QUIET.
WHAT'S GOING ON?
- TONIGHT IN THE SILVER LOUNGE,
COURTNEY READ MY LOOK.
- I JUST THINK THAT YOUR DRAG
ISN'T AS POLISHED
AS THE OTHER DRAG
IN THE COMPETITION RIGHT NOW.
- DO YOU GUYS REALLY FEEL LIKE
I SHOULDN'T BE HERE?
- NO, NO, NO, NOT AT ALL.
- I THINK YOU DESERVE
TO BE HERE.
- I DO FEEL THAT
THE LOOK TONIGHT
WASN'T EXECUTED AS WELL
AS THE VISION IN YOUR HEAD,
BUT IF YOU WANT ANYTHING,
I GOT A WHOLE BOX FULL OF SHIT.
- I'VE GOT A WHOLE RACK
OF THINGS.
- I'VE BEEN DOING DRAG
FOR 13 YEARS,
AND I'M NOT BEING MEAN;
I'M JUST BEING FACTUAL.
BUT I DIDN'T MEAN IT IN ANY WAY
TO HURT HER FEELINGS.
I DON'T WANT YOU TO THINK
THAT I WAS SAYING
THAT YOU WEREN'T DESERVING
OF BEING IN THE COMPETITION.
- I THINK BECAUSE I HAVE
SUCH A BIG RESPECT FOR YOU,
IT MAKES ME FEEL BAD
ABOUT MYSELF.
LIKE, I NEED YOU TO UNDERSTAND,
LIKE, THAT HURT ME REALLY BAD.
NOTHING ELSE HAS HURT ME SINCE
I'VE BEEN IN THIS COMPETITION
THAN WHEN YOU TOLD ME
THAT I LOOKED UNPOLISHED.
- IF YOU NEED ANY HELP
OR ANYTHING,
I'M JUST TRYING TO OFFER A HAND
BECAUSE I WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU
DO EVEN BETTER.
- NO, AND I APPRECIATE YOU
OFFERING ME HELP, BUT I JUST--
I CAN'T HELP BUT TAKE IT
AS PATRONIZING ALMOST.
- WELL, I MEAN, I GUESS IT IS
A LITTLE BIT.
- AT THIS POINT, I DON'T KNOW IF
I LOOK UP TO COURTNEY AS MUCH.
THIS IS NOT ABOUT
MAKING FRIENDS.
NOW IT'S GAME ON.
[ENGINE STARTS]
- THE WINNER OF
"RuPAUL'S DRAG RACE"
RECEIVES A SICKENING SUPPLY
OF COLOREVOLUTION COSMETICS

BLAH, BLAH, BLAH."
I'M OVER IT.

OH, SCRUFF PIT CREW.

OH, THEY'RE ONLY 20 FEET AWAY
FROM MY CURRENT LOCATION.
[LAUGHTER]

IT'S SO FUNNY.
- [LAUGHTER]
ONE OF YOU STOOD OUT
BY THE HAIR PIECE ON
YOUR CHIN-Y CHIN CHIN.
JOSLYN FOX.
- YAY!
- [APPLAUSE]
- CONDRAGULATIONS,
THE FOX THAT ROCKS.
- THANK YOU, RU.
- NOW, LADIES,
FOR TODAY'S MAIN CHALLENGE,
YOU'LL BE PERFORMING A GOOD
OLD-FASHIONED COMEDY SHOW,
HASH TAG DRAGQUEENSOFCOMEDY.
EACH OF YOU NEEDS TO WRITE
AND PERFORM A STAND-UP COMEDY.
- HURRICANE BIANCA'S IN TOWN.
NO ONE IS SAFE.
- NOW, JOSLYN, SINCE YOU
WON THE MINI CHALLENGE,
YOU GET TO PICK THE ORDER
OF THE LINEUP.
NOW, I WANT YOU TO USE YOUR
CHARISMA, UNIQUENESS, NERVE,
AND TALENT TO TICKLE
MY FUNNY BONE.
- IT'S RIGHT HERE
WHERE MY RIB USED TO BE.
[LAUGHTER]
- SO, GENTLEMEN,
START YOUR ENGINES,
AND MAY THE BEST WOMAN WIN.
- ALL RIGHT,
LET'S DO THIS, LADIES.
- ALL RIGHT,
"COURTNEY IS AN ASSHOLE."
OH, MY GOD,
THAT'S A GUARANTEED LAUGH.
- HA HA!
- ARE THERE TWO R's
IN YOUR NAME?
- WHY, ARE YOU MAKING JOKES
ABOUT ME?
- NO, I'M JUST MAKING A LIST
OF ALL THE GIRLS
SO I CAN THINK ABOUT THE ORDER
I'M-A PUT YOU ALL IN.
- SO HERE'S WHAT YOU DO, JOSLYN.
YOU PUT BIANCA ON FIRST,
AND THEN WHOEVER YOU WANT
TO THROW UNDER THE BUS
YOU PUT SECOND.
- HA HA!
- THEN YOU PUT ME SECOND LAST
AND YOU LAST.
- THAT'S JUST SHADY.
YESTERDAY YOU WERE SUGGESTING
THAT HER DRAG WAS UGLY.
TODAY YOU'RE TELLING HER
HOW TO DO A LINEUP.
- YEAH, ISN'T THAT FUNNY?
- YOU ARE A SHADY CUNT.
- LOVE YOU, JOSLYN.
- [MOUTHING WORDS]
- DELA'S REALLY FREAKING ME OUT
RIGHT NOW.
THIS BITCH IS
TALKING TO HERSELF.
I WAS LIKE, "BITCH, I THOUGHT I
WAS THE CRAZY ONE UP IN HERE."
- WHAT DO YOU HAVE, BENDELA?
- UM, I THINK THAT
I'M GONNA GO WITH
SOMETHING THAT'S SORT OF MORE
A BLANKET PERSONAL NARRATIVE.
- HA HA!
KNEE-SLAPPER.
- COMING UP...
- I GET TO DECIDE THE ORDER
THE GIRLS PERFORM IN.
FIRST UP, OPENING THE SHOW...
[ENGINE REVS]
- HA HA!
[BELL DINGS]
- HA HA!
- TODAY WE'RE GETTING READY FOR
OUR STAND-UP COMEDY ROUTINE
IN FRONT OF A LIVE AUDIENCE.
THIS IS DEFINITELY
ONE OF THE HARDEST CHALLENGES
OF THE COMPETITION SO FAR.
- ADORE, ARE YOU
GONNA WRITE MATERIAL,
OR ARE YOU JUST GONNA
WRITE A CARD FOR GUIDELINES
SAYING "COOL, AWESOME, CHOLA,
MY MOM, LIBRA?"
- "PARTY."
- "PARTY." HA HA!
- FUCK OFF.
FUCK ALL THE WAY OFF.
SHIT.
- SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO, JOS?
HAVE YOU GOT ANY IDEAS?
- WHEN I WAIT TABLES,
LIKE, THAT'S, LIKE,
MY OPPORTUNITY TO BE
A STAND-UP COMEDIAN,
SO I'M ALWAYS CRACKING JOKES.
IF SOMEBODY ORDERS
A JUMBO SHRIMP COCKTAIL,
I'LL SAY, "I HOPE
YOU'RE NOT ALLERGIC."
AND THEY'LL SAY, "TO WHAT?"
AND I'LL SAY, "TO AN OXYMORON."
JUMBO SHRIMP.
- PREGNANT PAUSE.
PREGNANT PAUSE.
- HA HA!
- I KNOW THAT STAND-UP COMEDY
IS NOT MY CUP OF SOUP--
CUP OF TEA--CUP OF--
BOWL OF WHAT?
CUP OF TEA.
THIS IS NOT MY CUP OF TEA.
HA HA!
- WHERE DID--
WHERE DID LAGANJA GO?
- I DON'T KNOW.
- LAGANJA, ARE YOU HERE?
OH, OH, WELL.
- YES, GIRL. OK.
- I LOVE IT.
SHE'S UNDER THE TABLE.
- HOW Y'ALL DOING?
- OH, LET ME GET MORE ATTENTION
LIKE THE BIG "NO-SMOKING"
SIGN ON MY HEAD.
LET ME GET UNDER A TABLE.
REALLY, QUEEN?
- MY NAME IS
MISS LAGANJA ESTRANJA,
BUT YOU CAN CALL ME
MISS MARY JANE,
LITTLE MISS 4/20,
OR FOR MY LATIN FOLK
IN THE AUDIENCE, LA MARIJUANA.
- I THINK IN THIS COMPETITION
YOU HAVE TO STAND OUT
AND BE A BOLD CHARACTER.
THIS IS THE PERFECT CHALLENGE
TO SHOWCASE LAGANJA.
HONEY, I AM GONNA GIVE YOU
STONER REALNESS.
NOW, GIRL, IF IT AIN'T GREEN,
WELL, GIRL, I'M NOT INTERESTED.
- I NEED A TRANSITION.
- THE JUDGES SAY THAT
I'M HIDING BEHIND A CHARACTER,
BUT I THINK LAGANJA
IS MAYBE THE PERSON
WHO'S ACTUALLY AFRAID
TO BE EXPOSED RIGHT NOW.
- HOW YOU DOING, DELA?
- OH, I'M PLUGGING AWAY.
HOW ARE YOU?
- GIRL, I'M JUST TRYING TO,
YOU KNOW,
REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS LIKE
TO BE IN A TENT
AND JUST, YOU KNOW, REALLY
CHANNEL THAT INNER CHILD.
- OK.
- THIS PERSON IS NOT THE LAGANJA
THAT I KNOW,
AND IT'S FREAKING ME
THE HELL OUT.
- OK?
- HELLO, HELLO, HELLO.
- HI.
- HI.
- HOW ARE MY DRAG QUEENS
OF COMEDY?
- HILARIOUS.
- YUCK-A, YUCK-A, YUCK.
HA HA!
HEY, DELA.
- HI, RU.
- NOW, LAST WEEK
YOU WERE IN THE BOTTOM TWO.
- YES, I WAS.
- DO YOU FEEL A LOT OF PRESSURE
TO BOUNCE BACK FROM ALL THAT?
- I DEFINITELY DO, YEAH.
I WAS REALLY DEVASTATED
TO BE DOWN THERE.
- WHAT ARE YOU
THE MOST NERVOUS ABOUT?
- I, YOU KNOW, DON'T HAVE
ZINGY ONE-LINERS.
I CONSIDER MY HUMOR
TO BE VERY CHARACTER-BASED.
- YOU KNOW, THERE WAS
THE NOTE FROM MICHELLE
THAT SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE
BECAUSE YOU DO A CHARACTER.
- YEAH.
- BUT ON AN EMOTIONAL LEVEL
THAT THAT WASN'T COMING THROUGH.
- BUT I ALSO FEEL LIKE THIS IS
THE PERFECT CHALLENGE FOR ME
TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY
TO DO THAT.
- WELL, I LOOK FORWARD TO IT.
GET BACK TO WORK.
- THANK YOU, RU.
- ALL RIGHT.
WELL, HELLO, MISS BIANCA.
- HI.
- EVERYONE'S LOOKING TO YOU
TO BE THE STANDOUT
IN THIS CHALLENGE.
DOES THAT MAKE YOU NERVOUS?
- CONCERNED, YEAH.
- BUT YOU'RE VERY FUNNY.
- BUT FOR ME,
IT'S MORE OBSERVATIONS
AND IN THE MOMENT,
AND I DON'T DO WELL
WITH SITTING DOWN
AND WRITING, "HERE IS A JOKE."
- NOW, IN THE PAST, YOU'VE
ACTUALLY HELPED A LOT OF QUEENS
IN THIS COMPETITION.
- YEAH.
- WHO'S HELPING YOU OUT?
- WELL, THEY'RE ALL
HELPING ME OUT
BY BEING HORRIBLE
AND MAKING ME LOOK BETTER.
- HA HA!
- AND I'M NOT JUST
A NASTY CUNT.
I WILL HELP THEM PACK
TO GO HOME.
- HA HA!
- I MEAN, YOU DON'T EVEN
GOT TO FOLD
SOME OF THE SHIT
THEY'RE WEARING.
YOU JUST BALL IT UP.
"PUT THAT IN BAG NUMBER 5,
BITCH.
GET TO STEPPING."
- ALL RIGHT, SEE YOU OUT THERE.
- THANK YOU.
THIS CHALLENGE IS REALLY A SHIT
OR GET OFF THE POT MOMENT,
SO LET'S HOPE I CAN DELIVER
A NICE, BIG TURD.
- TRINITY K. BONET,
HEY, MAMA.
- HI.
- HAVE YOU EVER DONE STAND-UP
BEFORE?
- NO.
- DO YOU KNOW ANY JOKES?
- UM...
I CAN'T TELL YOU EXACTLY
WHAT IT'S GONNA BE RIGHT NOW,
BUT WHEN I FEEL LIKE, LIKE
I HAVE A MAGNIFYING GLASS
OVER ME OR SOMETHING,
THAT'S WHEN IT GETS HARD.
- I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE CAPABLE OF.
IN THE LAST CHALLENGE,
YOUR COMEDY CAME OUT,
BUT IT'S INTERESTING THAT
ALMOST BY HABIT YOU SHUT DOWN.
- I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S JUST ALMOST SOMETHING
I CAN'T CONTROL.
YOU JUST--
YOU ARE WHO YOU ARE.
- I KNOW THAT
THERE'S A BLOCK THERE,
AND SO THAT'S FOR YOU TO UNLOCK.
DON'T LET THE MOMENT
PASS YOU BY.
ALL RIGHT, TRINITY,
I'M COUNTING ON YOU.
- RU IS COUNTING ON ME TO
DELIVER SOMETHING THAT HE
KNOW DAMN WELL I CAN'T DO.
- ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
GATHER ROUND.
TO PROVE THAT YOUR COMEDY
HAS A BROAD APPEAL,
I'VE INVITED A SENIOR CITIZENS
GROUP TO JOIN US.
YES, THEY WILL BE SITTING
FRONT AND CENTER.
- I TOLD YOU IT WAS GONNA BE
AN OLD-FASHIONED COMEDY SHOW.
MAKE 'EM LAUGH.
- ANYONE CLOSE TO ME KNOWS
THAT CUNT, BITCH, FUCK,
DAMN, SHIT AND ASS
ARE MY FAVORITE WORDS TO USE.
HA HA! I'M FUCKED.
- GENTLEMEN,
START YOUR ENGINES...
AND MAY THE BEST WOMAN WIN.
- SO IS ANYONE CURIOUS AS TO
THE ORDER I'VE PUT US ALL IN?
- OOH, YES.
- OH, GOD.
- BECAUSE I WON
THE MINI CHALLENGE TODAY,
I GET TO DECIDE THE ORDER
THAT THE GIRLS PERFORM IN
FOR THE COMEDY SHOW.
OK, NOW, FIRST UP,
WE WILL BE OPENING THE SHOW
WITH NONE OTHER THAN
THE INCOMPARABLE DARIENNE LAKE.
- YAY!
- YAY!
- FOLLOWING DARIENNE
IS COURTNEY ACT.
- JOSLYN IS
A SHADY LITTLE CHARACTER.
HA HA!
SHE'S DUMB LIKE A FOX,
BUT BECAUSE
I'M FOLLOWING DARIENNE,
I HAVE TO MAKE SURE
THAT I'M VERY FUNNY.
- AND COURTNEY WILL BE
INTRODUCING OUR THIRD PERFORMER,
ADORE.
- YES.
- FOLLOWING ADORE
WILL BE MISS BENDELACREME.
- ALL RIGHT.
- AND THEN IN OUR FIFTH SLOT,
IT'S LAGANJA ESTRANJA.
- OOH.
- AFTER LAGANJA WILL BE
MISS TRINITY K. BONET.
- FOLLOWING TRINITY WILL BE THE
FUNNIEST GIRL OF THE WHOLE BIT,
MS. JOSLYN FO--
OH, THAT'S ME.
- [LAUGHTER]
- AND THEN CLOSING THE SHOW
WILL BE THE OLDEST
OF ALL THE QUEENS,
MISS BIANCA DEL RIO.
- LET'S HOPE I CAN STAY AWAKE
TILL I GO ON.
- COMING UP...
- I KNOW WE GOT SOME OLD PEOPLE
HERE IN THE AUDIENCE TONIGHT.
YEAH, DID YOU GUYS
ALL COME TOGETHER ON THE ARK?
[ENGINE REVS]
- HA HA!
[BELL DINGS]
- HA HA!
- I AM SPARKLE TOSS.
- IT'S COMEDY.
- TODAY WE HAVE TO DO
A STAND-UP ROUTINE
IN FRONT OF A LIVE AUDIENCE.
I'VE NEVER DONE ONE, LET ALONE
IN FRONT OF THE ELDERLY.
FOR ME, THIS IS THE TOUGHEST
CHALLENGE THUS FAR.
IT'S GONNA BE ROUGH.
- SO JOSY JO-STICKS,
DO YOU HAVE ANY OLD PEOPLE
THAT YOU RELATE TO?
- I'M VERY CLOSE
WITH MY GRANDPARENTS,
AND THEY'VE ALWAYS BEEN
VERY SUPPORTIVE OF ME.
- OH, THAT'S COOL.
- AND MY GRANDFATHER WAS,
YOU KNOW, ALWAYS MY BIGGEST FAN.
- AW.
- AND I REMEMBER, HE HAD READ
ABOUT A BROADWAY STAR.
SHE WAS UP FOR HER FIRST TONY.
THEN SHE OVERHEARD SOME
OF THE OTHER NOMINEES SAYING
HOW BIG OF A JOKE SHE WAS
AND THAT SHE DIDN'T DESERVE
TO BE NOMINATED
AND THERE'S NO WAY
SHE WAS GOING TO WIN.
AND SHE SAID SHE GOT
REALLY DOWN ON HERSELF
AND WENT BACK OUT THERE
COMPLETELY FEELING DEFEATED,
AND THEN SHE WON THE TONY.
I REMEMBER HIM BRINGING ME
THAT ARTICLE AND SAYING,
"YOU CAN BE THAT SAME PERSON.
YOU HAVE WHAT IT TAKES."
THIS IS KIND OF LIKE MY F.U.
TO ALL THE PEOPLE WHO THOUGHT
I COULDN'T SUCCEED IN IT.
AND I JUST--I CAN'T WAIT
TO HEAR WHAT HE HAS TO SAY,
'CAUSE I KNOW HE'LL BE PROUDER
THAN ANYONE ELSE.
- OH, THAT'S NICE.
- BIANCA, YOU HAVE
ANY WORRIES AT ALL?
- I DON'T FUCKIN' KNOW,
YOU KNOW.
- WHAT'S YOUR WORST NIGHTMARE
OF GOING OUT THERE?
- MY WORST NIGHTMARE IS SITTING
NEXT TO YOU LIKE WE ARE NOW.
- [GASPS]
- [LAUGHTER]
- YOU'RE, LIKE, EVIL NICE.
LIKE, WHAT'S WITH THAT?
LIKE, YOU CAN'T HATE YOU
'CAUSE YOU'RE HELPFUL
AND YOU'RE SWEET,
BUT YOU'RE TRUTHFUL,
BUT YOU'RE A DICK.
- NOW, IF YOU'D SAID THIS
ON DAY ONE,
I WOULD HAVE BEEN YOUR FRIEND.
IT'S AMAZING WE GET THIS CLOSE,
AND YOU'RE LEAVING TODAY.
- WHAT?
- HA HA!
- I FUCKIN' HATE YOU.
- HA HA!
AND WHAT?
WELCOME TO THE MAIN STAGE
OF RuPAUL'S CHUCKLE HUT.
- [LAUGHTER]
- L.O.L.,
IT'S MICHELLE VISAGE.
- THE FIERCE FLOWER
IS CLEARLY IN BLOOM TONIGHT.
- HA HA! MY FAVORITE STRAIGHT
MAN, SANTINO RICE.
- HA HA!
BLOOMING GORGEOUS, RU.
- COMEDY LEGEND, BRUCE VILANCH.
- I'M GONNA COME OVER
AND POLLINATE YOU.
- HA HA!
I THOUGHT YOU'D NEVER ASK.
AND JAIME PRESSLY.
- HELLO.
- HOW CAN ONE PERSON
BE SO BEAUTIFUL AND SO FUNNY?
I'M TALKING ABOUT MYSELF.
- CLEARLY.
- [LAUGHTER]
- J.K., MISS THING.
WE ARE SO HAPPY
TO HAVE YOU HERE.
THIS WEEK
WE CHALLENGED OUR QUEENS
TO PUT ON A GOOD
OLD-FASHIONED COMEDY SHOW,
AND BOY, ARE MY ARMS TIRED.
- [LAUGHTER]
- GENTLEMEN, START YOUR ENGINES,
AND MAY THE BEST WOMAN WIN.
THE DRAG QUEENS OF COMEDY.
- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
- HEY.
MY NAME IS MISS DARIENNE LAKE.
I LIKE TO SAY MISS
'CAUSE IT LETS THE BOYS
KNOW I'M SINGLE, YOU KNOW.
- [LAUGHTER]
- OF COURSE, MY 14 CATS
AND MY APPEARANCE
ON "HOARDERS BURIED ALIVE"
MIGHT ALSO LET THEM KNOW
I'M SINGLE.
- [LAUGHTER]
- I ASKED MY MOTHER,
I'M LIKE, "MOM, HOW DID
I END UP SO TWISTED?
LIKE, DID YOU, LIKE, DROP ME
ON MY HEAD WHEN I WAS A BABY?"
SHE WAS LIKE, "HONEY, YOU HAVE
TO BE HELD TO BE DROPPED."
- [LAUGHTER]
- I AM HERE REPRESENTING
ALL THE BIG AND CURVY GIRLS.
- HEY.
- I'M TRYING TO GET IN SHAPE.
I MEAN--WELL, ROUND
IS A SHAPE, YOU KNOW.
- [LAUGHTER]
- AT THE GYM, I'M LIKE A NINJA.
YOU WILL NEVER SEE ME THERE.
- [LAUGHTER]
- I KNOW WE GOT SOME OLD PEOPLE
HERE IN THE AUDIENCE TONIGHT.
YES, HOW Y'ALL DOING?
YEAH, DID YOU GUYS
ALL COME TOGETHER ON THE ARK?
- [LAUGHTER]
- TELL NOAH I SAID HELLO.
- AS YOU MAY HAVE ALL GATHERED
FROM MY ACCENT, I AM FROM IDAHO.
- [LAUGHTER]
- I'M KIDDING.
I'M FROM AUSTRALIA,
LAND OF KANGAROOS,
LAND OF OLIVIA NEWTON JOHN,
AND THROWING ALL THE SHRIMP
ON THE BARBIE.
- YEAH.
- WELL, WHAT IF I DON'T WANT
SHRIMP THROWN ON ME?
I WANT TO LOOK FISHY,
NOT SMELL FISHY.
- [LAUGHTER]
- SO I MOVED TO AMERICA
RECENTLY.
I MOVED TO WEST HOLLYWOOD,
AND I'VE WRITTEN A LITTLE BIT
OF A SONG
ABOUT SOME OF THE PEOPLE
THAT I'VE MET THERE,
AND I'D LIKE TO SING IT
FOR YOU NOW.
[CLEARS THROAT]
BUT DO THINK TWICE
- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
- THANK YOU.
- HI. YOU'RE PROBABLY WONDERING
WHY I LOOK LIKE A MEXICAN KATY
PERRY RIGHT NOW, AREN'T YOU?
MY MOTHER IS A CHOLA.
DO YOU GUYS KNOW
WHAT A CHOLA IS?
CAN I GET A SHOW OF HANDS?
YEAH, WE'RE IN L.A.,
MOTHERFUCKER.
YEAH. MY MOM'S A CHOLA,
AND SHE LIKES BIG COCK.
OK, NO, YEAH.
I WAS REALLY SCARED WHEN I HEARD
THAT SENIOR CITIZENS
WERE GONNA BE IN THE FUCKING
AUDIENCE TONIGHT, OK?
JUST BLAME MY FUCKING GRANDMA
BECAUSE SHE LIKES TO GO TO T.J.
AND GET WORK DONE,
SO I NEVER GRASPED THE CONCEPT
TO RESPECT MY ELDERS.
THE BITCH NEVER AGES.
SHE HAS A FAKE ASS
AND A FAKE HIP,
AND I'M PRETTY SURE THE ASS
CAME FIRST AND BROKE THE HIP,
SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL
SHE'S DOING.
BUT ANYWAYS,
MY GRANDMA'S A WHORE.
NO? COOL.
IT'S MY FIRST TIME, PEOPLE.
HA HA! YOU GUYS HAVING FUN?
- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
- I'LL MOW YOUR LAWNS LATER.
- MY NAME IS BENDELACREME.
HOLD FOR APPLAUSE.
'KAY.
AND I'M DELIGHTED TO BE HERE
WITH A LIVE AUDIENCE.
I LOVE IT WHEN THERE'S PEOPLE
JUST RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME,
AND I CAN FEEL LIKE I CAN JUST
REACH RIGHT OUT AND TOUCH YOU
IF I WANTED TO.
I DON'T WANT TO.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT.
BUT I FEEL LIKE I COULD
IF I WANTED TO,
WHICH IS A GREAT OPTION TO HAVE.
I'M FAR AWAY FROM MY HOME TOWN
OF SEATTLE, WASHINGTON.
IT'S THE CITY THAT NEVER DRIES,
BUT, YOU KNOW, IT'S--
RAIN IS NOT SO BAD.
IT IS A MOIST AREA,
BUT IT'S MY MOIST AREA.
AND I LOVE IT.
A LOT OF PEOPLE COME THERE.
YOU JUST NEED TO WEAR
THE RIGHT PROTECTION, YOU KNOW.
THERE'S A LOT OF STEREOTYPES
ABOUT SEATTLE-ITES,
BUT THEY'RE REALLY JUST REGULAR
FOLK, EXTREMELY REGULAR FOLK.
YOU KNOW, CAFFEINE--
ALL IN LINE FOR THE RESTROOM.
WE LOVE A GOOD REST,
BUT, UM--I DIGRESS.
THE POINT IS I FEEL LIKE
I'VE LEARNED TO SORT
OF WEAVE A STORY,
BRING SOMEBODY ON AN ARC
THAT REALLY ENDS SOMEWHERE
WHERE THEY FEEL LIKE THE WHOLE
THING'S BEEN MEANINGFUL,
AND THEY'RE GONNA WIND UP
WITH SOMETHING THAT MADE
THE WHOLE THING WORTHWHILE.
- SO TELL US A JOKE.
- UM, GOOD NIGHT, EVERYBODY.
- [SCATTERED APPLAUSE]
- WOW.
[ENGINE REVS]
- HA HA!
[BELL DINGS]
- HA HA!
[ENGINE REVS]
- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
- HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY,
PUT YOUR LIGHTERS UP.
GANJA'S IN THE HOUSE.
YEAH.
AS YOU COULD TELL
FROM MY ACCENT,
I AM FROM DALLAS, TEX-ASS,
AND IT WAS NOT VERY EASY
GROWING UP LOOKING LIKE THIS,
WHETHER I WAS PLAYING
IN MY GRANDMA'S CLOTHES
OR PUTTING ON A SHOW
FOR MY WELL-ORGANIZED,
ALPHABETICALLY-ORDERED
BEANIE BABIES.
I WAS GA-GA-GA-GAY, OK?
BUT IT WASN'T UNTIL
I MOVED TO LOS ANGELES
THAT I DISCOVERED MARIJUANA.
I MEAN, I LIKE TO SMOKE.
Y'ALL, I AM JUST FLYING AS HIGH
AS YOUR RECEDING HAIRLINE, OK?
MARIJUANA REALLY DOES
HELP ME CALM DOWN.
SO, Y'ALL, I WENT TO VALENCIA
WHERE THEY FILM THE
TV SHOW "WEEDS."
NOW, Y'ALL, IT'S VERY DRY.
IT'S ALMOST KIND OF LIKE
YOUR VAGINA.
CAN I GET A AMEN?
NOW, Y'ALL, I AM A TREE HUGGER
BECAUSE IF IT AIN'T GREEN,
HA, I'M NOT INTERESTED, OK?
- [SCATTERED APPLAUSE]
- GET UP AND SHOW ME SOME LOVE.
COME ON, GET UP.
SHOW ME SOME LOVE.
GET UP.
I GOT ON ALL THIS SHIT,
ALL THIS DRAG.
THIS STUFF IS HOT.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
THIS AIN'T EASY.
I'M NOT A COMEDIAN.
SO, GO ON, SIT DOWN.
SIT DOWN. SIT DOWN.
SIT DOWN. SHIT. SHIT.
SIT DOWN.
SO IF YOU ALL HAVE NOT
ALREADY NOTICED,
I AM BLACK, BUT DON'T BE
WORRIED, YOU KNOW,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO HOLD ON TO
YOUR PURSES AND YOUR WALLETS.
I ALREADY GOT 'EM.
- [LAUGHTER]
- GROWING UP FOR ME
WAS REALLY HARD
BECAUSE WE WERE REALLY POOR.
WE WERE, LIKE,
"GOOD TIMES" POOR.
IT WAS REALLY, REALLY BAD.
AND THE ONLY WAY WE HAD
THE OPPORTUNITY TO EAT
WAS, MY MOTHER WOULD READ US
RECIPES FROM A COOKBOOK.
- [LAUGHTER]
- AND, OH, HOW I GOT FULL
MANY NIGHTS
OFF OF THE ROAST BEEF
ON PAGE 27.
- [LAUGHTER]
- BUT A REALLY UNFORTUNATE THING
HAPPENED.
MY SISTER CAUGHT
A EAR INFECTION,
SO SHE STARVED TO DEATH.
- [LAUGHTER]
- I REALLY GREW UP A LOT
WITH MY GRANDMOTHER.
I STAYED AT
MY GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE,
ONE, BECAUSE SHE WAS JUST
A SWEET LADY,
AND TWO, BECAUSE SHE HAD FOOD.
BUT SHE HAD THIS REALLY CRAZY
OBSESSION WITH HER BILLS,
AND IT WAS THE LIGHT BILL
IN PARTICULAR.
EVERYTHING INVOLVED
THE LIGHT BILL.
"STOP RUNNING AROUND MY HOUSE
LIKE THAT.
YOU GONNA RUN MY LIGHT BILL UP."
- [LAUGHTER]
- "STOP FLUSHING THAT TOILET
SO MUCH.
"YOU GONNA RUN
MY DAMN LIGHT BILL UP.
"STOP BREATHING SO MUCH.
YOU GONNA RUN MY LIGHT BILL UP."
I JUST FEEL LIKE I CAN BE MYSELF
AND JUST LET MY HAIR DOWN
WITH ALL OF YOU PEOPLE.
- OH!
- [LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
- GOOD TIMES.
IT'S A PARTY.
IT'S A PARTY.
YES.
- YOU KNOW, I'VE SUFFERED
FROM ADHD ALL OF MY LIFE.
IT'S A CONSTANT STRUGGLE
EVERY DAY.
- AW.
- OOH, LOOK, A RHINESTONE.
- [LAUGHTER]
- BUT I'M ALWAYS GETTING SHIT,
YOU KNOW.
"OH, YOU'RE SO SKINNY.
WHY DON'T YOU
JUST EAT SOMETHING,"
OR, "EAT A CHEESEBURGER,
YOU SKINNY BITCH."
AND ALL I WANT TO SAY IS, "WELL,
THEN GIVE ME SOMETHING TO EAT.
I'M FUCKING STARVING."
SO I'VE GOT A LITTLE THEORY
GOING HERE.
EVER SINCE I'VE COME TO THE SHOW
AND I MET RuPAUL,
I HAVE A LITTLE THEORY HERE.
I'M GONNA RUN IT BY YOU.
I'VE SEEN RuPAUL IN THE WORKROOM
OUT OF DRAG.
I SEE RuPAUL HERE ON THE RUNWAY
AS A DRAG QUEEN.
NEVER IN THE SAME ROOM
AT THE SAME TIME.
BOTH RuPAULS--SAME PERSON.
PRETTY SURE I CRACKED THE CODE.
JUST SAYING.
- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
- I AM SO EXCITED TO SEE
THE CAST OF "COCOON" IS HERE.
YOU LOOK FABULOUS.
MISS, I'M OVER HERE.
BRING BOTH EYES.
I'M RIGHT HERE.
DAMN, PEARL HARBOR
MUST HAVE DID YOU IN.
ON A LIGHTER NOTE, I'D LIKE TO
LET YOU KNOW ABOUT MY FAMILY.
MY MOTHER IS FROM CUBA,
AND MY DAD IS FROM HONDURAS,
WHICH BASICALLY MEANS I HAVE
A LARGE DICK, NO CREDIT,
AND A TENDENCY TO TAKE THINGS
THAT DON'T BELONG TO ME.
- [LAUGHTER]
- MY MOTHER INSISTED
THAT WE STAY TRUE TO
OUR SPANISH HERITAGE,
SO MY FIRST WORDS
WERE, "HOUSEKEEPING."
- [LAUGHTER]
- I LIKE THE GENTLEMEN
IN THE BACK WHO'S SLEEPING.
MAKES ME FEEL RIGHT AT HOME.
CAN YOU WAKE THAT BITCH UP?
YEAH, THE ONE RIGHT THERE
WITH THE HORIZONTAL STRIPES.
NOT A GOOD LOOK IN YOUR THIRD
TRIMESTER, SIR, ALL RIGHT?
- [LAUGHTER]
- ALL I'VE EVER HEARD
FROM THE JUDGES
WAS THAT WE NEED
TO SEE MORE VERSATILITY.
YOU KNOW WHAT
I GOT TO SAY TO Y'ALL
IS THAT I WILL SHOW YOU
VERSATILITY
WHEN SANTINO WINS
A SEWING COMPETITION
AND VISAGE WEARS A FUCKING
TURTLENECK, YOU HEAR ME?
- [LAUGHTER]
- AIN'T GONNA HAPPEN.
WELL, I GOT TO SAY, I HOPE
YOU GUYS HAD A LOT OF FUN,
AND BECAUSE
I'M FEELING EXTRA SPECIAL,
I'M GONNA PUT FRESH TENNIS BALLS
ON EVERY WALKER IN THE PLACE.
- [LAUGHTER]
- JELL-O ALL AROUND.
THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
MWAH.
- COMING UP...
- I GOT ZERO FUNNY FROM YOU.
- I JUST DIDN'T THINK ANYTHING
WAS REALLY DEVELOPED.
- THAT'S THE NIGHTCLUB, GIRL.
WHAT WE'RE TELLING YOU
IS WHAT IT TAKES.
- [SNIFFLES]
[ENGINE REVS]
- HA HA!
[BELL DINGS]
- HA HA!
WELCOME, LADIES.
IT'S TIME FOR
THE JUDGES' CRITIQUES.
FIRST UP, DARIENNE LAKE.
BRUCE YOU CAME OUT TO
THE DRIEST, COLDEST
HOUSE IMAGINABLE.
YOU GOT THEM LAUGHING.
YOU'RE AMAZING.
- LIKE, LITERALLY, MY NOTE SAYS,
"KILLED IT."
- THANK YOU SO MUCH, DARIENNE.
NEXT UP, COURTNEY ACT.
- I THOUGHT YOU DID OK,
BUT IF YOU'RE GONNA USE A SHTICK
LIKE A SONG,
THAT SHIT HAD BETTER BE THE
FUNNIEST SONG I'VE EVER HEARD.
- MM-HMM.
- AND IT WASN'T.
- BUT YOU'RE NOT
A STAND-UP COMIC,
SO I THOUGHT IT WAS
VERY CLEVERLY CALCULATED
TO PLAY TO YOUR STRENGTHS.
- ALL RIGHT, NEXT UP,
ADORE DELANO.
- I LOVE THE CHARACTER.
YOU HAD SOME FUNNY JOKES,
BUT DON'T JUST THROW F-BOMBS
AROUND WILLY-NILLY
WHEN THEY'RE NOT ADDING
TO THE PARTY.
YOU'RE RELYING A LOT ON
YOUR CHARM AND PERSONALITY,
WHICH CONCERNS ME.
- [SNIFFLES]
I'M REALLY, REALLY TRYING.
I WANT TO KNOW THAT, LIKE,
I'M HERE...BECAUSE I DESERVE IT.
[SNIFFLES]
- ADORE, THE CHARMING THING
IS A GREAT PLUS,
BUT YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE FAITH
IN YOUR TALENT.
- THANKS.
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S MOVE ON.
BENDELACREME.
- I'M KIND OF GETTING BORED
WITH THESE OLD SHOWGIRL LOOKS.
- I ACTUALLY CHOSE THIS
BECAUSE MICHELLE WAS SAYING THAT
SHE'D LIKE TO SORT OF SEE
MORE ME.
- BUT IT'S GOT NOTHING TO DO
WITH YOUR CLOTHES, BABY.
IT'S STEPPING OUT
OF THAT CHARACTER
AND SHOWING US
WHO YOU ARE INSIDE.
- WHILE YOU HAVE
INTELLIGENT JOKES,
YOU DIDN'T STOP LONG ENOUGH
TO LET YOUR CROWD LAUGH
OR HEAR THE JOKE.
- NEXT UP, LAGANJA ESTRANJA.
- HEY, HEY, HEY.
- I GOT ZERO FUNNY FROM YOU.
YOU DO THIS THING,
THIS "OKAY, OKAY."
I WANT YOU TO STRIP DOWN
THAT AFFECTED FACADE
THAT IS THERE,
AND THE FEW TIMES THAT
I'VE SEEN YOU NOT DO THAT,
I'VE STARTED TO WARM UP TO YOU.
ONCE YOU GO INTO THAT...
[BABBLING]
THEN WE LOSE YOU.
- TONIGHT WASN'T A CHARACTER,
AND I DO--
I DO TALK LIKE THAT,
AND I'M SORRY YOU...
- NO, NO, YOU TALK LIKE THIS.
THIS IS HOW YOU TALK.
- PHEW.
I AM TRYING TOOTH AND NAIL
TO IMPRESS YOU GUYS.
- YOU WON THE CHALLENGE
LAST WEEK.
- BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT DIDN'T FEEL LIKE A WIN, RU,
BECAUSE ALL I COULD HEAR WAS
MY CROTCH IS TOO LOW,
MY HAIR IS OFF.
AND I FEEL LIKE AN AMATEUR
UP HERE,
AND I FEEL LIKE I CAN NEVER
DO ANYTHING TO PLEASE YOU.
AND I DO LOVE MYSELF, AND
I DO BELIEVE I'M A SUPERSTAR,
AND I AM FIGHTING SO HARD
TO PROVE THAT TO YOU.
AND I'VE GIVEN UP EVERYTHING
IN MY LIFE TO BE A DRAG QUEEN,
AND I'M...
- BREATHE, BREATHE.
WE ALL DO THAT KIKI VOICE.
IT'S A FUNNY VOICE, BUT YOU
CAN'T DO THAT ALL THE TIME.
IT'S THE SAME NOTE WE HAD
FOR BENDELACREME.
IT SEPARATES YOU
FROM BEING HUMAN.
- YOU KNOW, IN THE REAL WORLD,
PEOPLE LOVE ME,
AND THEY THINK
I'M SUCH A PERFORMER,
AND THEY LOVE TO COME
AND SEE ME.
AND I GET SO BUILT UP--
- THAT'S THE NIGHTCLUB, GIRL.
YOU CAME IN THIS COMPETITION
TO GO TO THE NEXT LEVEL.
WHAT WE'RE TELLING YOU
IS WHAT IT TAKES,
AND I'M NOT GONNA
FUCKING STEER YOU WRONG,
NOT FOR NO GODDAMN TV SHOW.
YOU'RE HERE BECAUSE
I SAW SOMETHING IN YOU,
BUT YOU HAVE GOT TO LEARN
HOW TO OWN YOUR STARDOM.
ALL RIGHT, SO LET'S MOVE ON.
TRINITY K. BONET.
- GIRL, YOU DID US PROUD
TONIGHT.
- [APPLAUSE]
- SO, TRINITY, I'MA TRY TO SAY
THIS WITHOUT GETTING EMOTIONAL.
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU.
BASED ON WHAT YOU'VE DONE
IN THIS COMPETITION BEFORE,
THERE SEEMS TO BE A CERTAIN
DEFEATED ENERGY THAT I'VE SEEN,
AND I DO THE SAME THING MYSELF,
AND I HAVE TO...
[SIGHS]
I HAVE TO TALK MYSELF
OFF THAT LEDGE.
WHAT YOU'VE DONE IS YOU HAVE
OVERCOME YOUR SABOTEUR,
AND I'M SO PROUD TO SEE IT.
I'M SO PROUD TO SEE IT.
- [APPLAUSE]
- THANK YOU FOR BELIEVING IN ME,
BECAUSE I KNOW YOU SAW SOMETHING
IN ME, AND I APPRECIATE IT.
- THANK YOU.
LET'S MOVE ON.
JOSLYN FOX.
- KNOWING THAT BIANCA DEL RIO
IS A COMIC,
WHY WOULD YOU PUT YOURSELF
BEFORE HER?
- I THOUGHT SHE'D BE A GREAT WAY
TO CLOSE THE SHOW.
- SHE IS A GREAT CLOSER,
BUT WHAT IT DOES IS
IT PUTS THE PERSON BEFORE HER
IN A REALLY PRECARIOUS SITUATION
IF YOU'RE NOT AS STRONG.
- THE FUNNIEST THING
WAS THE A.D.D. THING.
THAT'S A CHARACTER.
THE REST OF THE ROUTINE
COULD BE THAT GIRL.
- YOU STARTED OUT STRONG,
BUT THEN YOU JUST FLAT LINED.
YOU'RE LIKE A COMEDY TERRORIST.
YOU CAN FLY THE PLANE,
BUT YOU CAN'T LAND IT.
- ALL RIGHT, BIANCA DEL RIO.
- I THINK YOU'RE AMAZING.
YOU'RE SO QUICK, BUT YOU KNOW
EXACTLY HOW TO LAND A JOKE
AND WHEN TO WAIT.
- YOU KILLED IT.
- THANKS.
- SO, SO, SO, SO, SO FUNNY.
- I THOUGHT IT WAS
ABSOLUTELY ASTONISHING.
I MEAN, YOU'RE THE REAL DEAL.
- THANK YOU.
- THANK YOU, LADIES.
WHILE YOU UNTUCK
IN THE FORM DECOR LOUNGE,
THE JUDGES AND I
WILL DELIBERATE.
[ENGINE REVS]
- JUST BETWEEN US GIRLS,
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
LET'S START WITH DARIENNE LAKE.
- SHE WAS COMFORTABLE
IN HER OWN SKIN.
SHE KNOWS WHO SHE IS.
SHE HAS HEART.
SHE PLAYED TO THE AUDIENCE.
I THOUGHT SHE WAS GREAT.
I LOVED HER.
- COURTNEY ACT.
- I THOUGHT HER ROUTINE
WAS AVERAGE.
- I THINK SHE WAS SMART
TO PLAY TO HER STRENGTH,
WHICH IS HER VOICE AND SINGING.
- BUT IT'S NOT EXACTLY
WHAT YOU ASKED FOR.
- NEXT UP, ADORE DELANO.
- SHE'S SUCH AN INTERESTING
PRESENCE ON STAGE.
- IF SHE REALLY GOT RID
OF ALL THAT DOUBT,
SHE WOULD BE UNSTOPPABLE.
- THINK OF YOURSELF AT THAT AGE,
YOU KNOW.
- HA! OH!
- TRY TO PULL YOU OUT OF THE
BACKSEAT OF CARS TO TELL YOU...
- [LAUGHTER]
- JUST SLAP THE DICK
OUT OF YOUR HAND
AND SAY, "MICHELLE, LISTEN."
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S MOVE ON
TO BENDELACREME.
- HER COMEDY WAS INTELLIGENT.
SHE JUST DOESN'T UNDERSTAND
COMIC TIMING.
- THE SMARTEST THING SHE DID
WAS,
WHEN THE HECKLER HAPPENED,
SHE GOT OFF.
- LAGANJA ESTRANJA.
- I JUST DON'T QUITE GET
THAT WHOLE CHARACTER
WHO SMOKES DOPE ALL THE TIME
AND YET CAN SPEAK FASTER
THAN THE BULLET TRAIN.
- WHEN YOU GET INTO
A BUSINESS LIKE THIS,
YOU HAVE TO BUILD THICK SKIN.
- YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO HANDLE
THE CRITICISM.
NOBODY'S SAYING
YOU'RE NOT TRYING, GIRL.
I'M SAYING
IT NEEDS TO BE BETTER.
- YEAH.
TRINITY K. BONET.
- I LOVED THAT SHE LAUGHED
AT HERSELF AND HER LIFE
AND ALLOWED US
TO DO THAT WITH HER.
- SHE FOLLOWED LAGANJA,
AND SHE MADE THEM STAND UP.
SHE CHANGED THE ENERGY
IN THE ROOM.
- JOSLYN FOX.
- SHE STARTED OUT VERY STRONG,
AND THEN IT JUST GOT LESS FUNNY.
- "OH, WOW, A RHINESTONE."
DONE.
- [LAUGHS]
- IT'S A WRAP.
- AND THEN THERE WAS BIANCA.
- THE SMART THING ABOUT HER IS,
SHE MAKES FUN OF HERSELF.
NOW SHE CAN MAKE FUN OF YOU.
- YES.
- I WANTED HER TO COME AFTER ME,
AND I WAS SITTING HERE, LIKE,
"DO ME. DO ME."
- WHEN YOU WANT SOMEBODY
TO RIP ON YOU, THAT'S A TALENT.
- SILENCE.
I'VE MADE MY DECISION.
BRING BACK MY FUNNY GIRLS.
[ENGINE REVS]
- HA HA!
- [BELL DINGS]
- HA HA!
WELCOME BACK, LADIES.
I'VE MADE SOME DECISIONS.
DARIENNE LAKE, YOU'RE SAFE.
- HOLY TRINITY K. BONET,
YOU ARE SAFE.
BIANCA DEL RIO,
TONIGHT YOU DIDN'T JUST KILL IT.
YOU WERE A MASS MURDERER.
CONDRAGULATIONS, YOU ARE THE
WINNER OF THIS WEEK'S CHALLENGE.
- [APPLAUSE]
- AND YOU'VE WON A ONE-OF-A-KIND
CUSTOM GOWN BY MARCO MARCO.
- FABULOUS.
- YOU MAY JOIN THE OTHER GIRLS.
COURTNEY, YOU'RE SAFE.
- THANK YOU.
- LAGANJA ESTRANJA,
YOU AIMED HIGH,
BUT YOUR ROUTINE
WAS A BUZZ KILL.
I'M SORRY, MY DEAR,
BUT YOU ARE UP FOR ELIMINATION.
ADORE DELANO, YOU'RE SAFE.
- THANK YOU.
- BENDELACREME,
YOU ARE A SMART COOKIE,
BUT TONIGHT YOUR COMEDY ROUTINE
CRUMBLED.
JOSLYN FOX, YOU ARE
A LOVABLE QUEEN,
BUT--AND IT'S QUITE
AN IMPRESSIVE BUTT--
YOUR PUNCH LINES FLAT LINED.
BENDELACREME, YOU'RE SAFE.
- THANK YOU.
THANK YOU ALL.
- JOSLYN, MY DEAR, I AM SORRY,
BUT YOU ARE UP FOR ELIMINATION.
TWO QUEENS STAND BEFORE ME.
LADIES, THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE
TO IMPRESS ME
AND SAVE YOURSELF
FROM ELIMINATION.
THE TIME HAS COME FOR YOU
TO LIP-SYNCH FOR YOUR LIFE.
GOOD LUCK, AND DON'T FUCK IT UP.
- HA HA!
- OH!
- YEAH!
- BOTH OF THE GIRLS
ON THE SAME BEAT OF THE SONG
NOT LOOKING AT EACH OTHER
JUMPED INTO THE SPLITS
AND HIT THE FLOOR.
IT IS SO GOOD.
- OH!
- HA HA!
LADIES, I'VE MADE MY DECISION.
- PLEASE DON'T SEND ME HOME.
PLEASE DON'T SEND ME HOME.
- JOSLYN FOX, SHANTE, YOU STAY.
- THANK YOU.
- YOU MAY JOIN THE OTHER GIRLS.
LAGANJA ESTRANJA,
OWN YOUR STAR POWER, MAMA,
AND KEEP FLYING HIGH.
- THANK YOU, RU,
FOR THIS INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE.
I KNOW THAT
IN MY HEART OF HEARTS,
I STAYED TRUE TO WHO I WAS,
AND I WILL BE THE FIRST QUEEN
TO ACTUALLY CHASSE AWAY.
- [APPLAUSE]
- HA HA!
- I CAME HERE TO WIN, AND IT
DIDN'T WORK OUT IN MY FAVOR,
BUT THIS WAS DEFINITELY
A JOURNEY FOR ME.
IT'S BEEN FILLED WITH
MANY UPS AND MANY DOWNS.
I'M HAPPY I MADE IT THIS FAR,
AND I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE
WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS.
- CONDRAGULATIONS,
MY 7 WONDERS OF THE WORLD.
NOW, REMEMBER,
IF YOU CAN'T LOVE YOURSELF,
HOW IN THE HELL YOU GONNA LOVE
SOMEBODY ELSE?
CAN I GET A AMEN IN HERE?
- AMEN.
- AMEN.
- ALL RIGHT, NOW,
LET THE MUSIC PLAY.


- PREVIOUSLY ON
"RUPAUL'S DRAG RACE"...
YOU'LL BE PERFORMING A GOOD
OLD-FASHIONED COMEDY SHOW.
- I AM SO EXCITED TO SEE
THE CAST OF "COCOON" IS HERE.
- IT'S VERY DRY.
IT'S ALMOST KIND OF
LIKE YOUR VAGINA, OK?
TONIGHT WASN'T A CHARACTER,
AND I DO LIKE--I DO TALK LIKE
THAT, AND I'M SORRY.
- NO, YOU TALK LIKE THIS.
THIS IS HOW YOU TALK.
- THIS IS ALL
TOO MUCH FOR ME.
YOU WIN.
YOU BROKE ME DOWN,
I FEEL LIKE SHIT,
AND OBVIOUSLY I'M ANNOYING.
- BIANCA DEL RIO,
CONDRAGULATIONS, YOU ARE
THE WINNER OF THIS
WEEK'S CHALLENGE.
- JOSLYN FOX...
SHANTE, YOU STAY.
LAGANJA ESTRANJA,
SASHAY AWAY.
- WOW. HOLY CRAP.
- GIRL, THIS HAS BEEN A DAY.
- OH, WHAT DID THIS
BITCH LEAVE ON THE MIRROR?
- NOT MUCH.
- THAT'S IT?
- WELL...
- WELL, I MEAN, NO, SHE DID
SAY THAT SHE FELT LIKE,
YOU KNOW, THE PEOPLE HERE DID
NOT LIKE HER, SO, I MEAN, WHAT
OF MUCH DO YOU REALLY
EXPECT FROM HER?
I MEAN, COME ON.
SHE GONE NOW.
IT IS WHAT IT IS.
IT'S A NEW CHAPTER, SO...
- I FEEL SORT OF AWKWARD
ABOUT THE WAY IT ENDED.
- IT WAS JUST VERY DARK
AND UGLY, AND THAT WAS NOT CUTE.
IT JUST SUCKS THAT SHE LEFT
ON THAT NOTE, AND WE COULDN'T,
LIKE, REALLY PATCH SHIT UP.
I COULD HAVE HANDLED IT
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.
- IT WASN'T A GREAT
WAY TO SAY GOOD-BYE.
- IT WAS NOT.
- IT WASN'T HER FAULT.
IT WAS BIANCA THAT MADE THE...
- OH, IT'S ALWAYS MY FAULT.
- YOU KNOW WHAT IS
YOUR FAULT, BIANCA?
- WHAT?
- WINNING THAT
FUCKING CHALLENGE.
- YES, AND I
STOLE YOUR MOMENT.
- OH, YOU WON.
- I'M STEALING EVERYTHING.
- BAM.
- THIS WAS TRINITY'S
TIME TO SHINE.
- COME ON, BITCH.
- I DIDN'T GO HOME,
AND I GOT SAFE,
AND RU GOT EMOTIONAL.
- SHE DID.
- I'M SO SURPRISED THAT THAT
WENT WELL, AND I THINK RU
PULLED SOMETHING OUT OF ME
THAT I DIDN'T KNOW I HAD,
AND NOW MY WHOLE
MISSION IS JUST TO WIN
A FUCKING CHALLENGE.
- HONESTLY, I HAVE TO SAY
AS BADLY AS I KNEW THAT I DID
WITH THIS CHALLENGE, I REALLY
DIDN'T THINK I WAS GONNA BE
IN THE BOTTOM TWO.
I REALLY THOUGHT THAT I
FELL KIND OF MIDDLE.
- JOSLYN'S JUST KIND OF
LIKE COASTING THROUGH
THE COMPETITION.
SHE'S LIKE THE DIDA RITZ
OF THIS SERIES, REALLY.
- JOSLYN IS NOT AS POLISHED
AS SOME OF THE OTHER QUEENS
IN THIS COMPETITION AT THIS
POINT, SO MY GUESS IS THAT
JOSLYN'S NEXT TO GO.
- BOBBY PIN.
[ENGINE STARTS]
- THE WINNER OF
"RUPAUL'S DRAG RACE" RECEIVES

- YEAH, SHE GOT A HOT BODY,
BUT HER FACE...
ALL RIGHT, BENDELA,
YOU'RE THE WINNER.
- YEAH!
- YOU'VE WON A YEAR SUPPLY
OF EYELASHES FROM EYLURE.
LADIES, AMERICA'S NEXT DRAG
SUPERSTAR NOT ONLY NEEDS TO
KNOW HOW TO SISSY THAT WALK,
SHE NEED TO KNOW HOW
TO SISSY THAT TALK.
NOW, FOR THIS WEEK'S MAIN
CHALLENGE, YOU'LL BE HOSTING
YOUR VERY OWN TALK SHOW.
IT'S TIME FOR THE RETURN
OF "THE RUPAUL SHOW."
- YAY.
- NOW, I BOOKED SOME EXTRA
SPECIAL GUESTS FOR YOU
TO INTERVIEW.
MY PAL CHAZ BONO!
- [GASPING]
- AND HIS GRANDMOTHER,
CHER'S MOM, SINGER GEORGIA HOLT.
- OH, MY GOSH.
- I LOVE CHAZ BONO,
AND GEORGIA HOLT--
MM, I'M A COUNTRY BOY.
I LOVE MY COUNTRY MUSIC,
AND SHE JUST HAS A VOICE
LIKE NO OTHER.
- I AM GOING TO BE ONE DEGREE
OF SEPARATION AWAY FROM CHER!
- GENTLEMEN,
START YOUR ENGINES,
AND MAY THE BEST WOMAN WIN.
- I'VE BEEN READ A LOT ON
THE RUNWAY FOR MY LOOKS,
SO THE FIRST THING I'M
GONNA DO IS CHOOSE MY LOOK.
- SO I NOTICE THAT EVERYBODY
IN THE ROOM IS WORKING
ON THEIR RESEARCH, AND JOSLYN
RUNS TO HER CLOSET TO PULL OUT
3 UGLY DRESSES.
REALLY? I THOUGHT FOR SURE
SHE'D HAVE WORN ONE
OF HER NON-BIKINIS.
THIS IS A SPECIAL EVENT.
- THE JUDGES HAVE BEEN PRETTY
CONSISTENT IN WHAT THEY'VE
SAID TO JOSLYN ABOUT HER
RUNWAY LOOKS, BUT I DON'T
THINK SHE'S GETTING THE NOTE.
- SHIT. I'M GONNA BE OK.
- COMING UP...
WE'LL BE JOINED BY OUR
EXTRA SPECIAL GUEST JUDGE
PAULA ABDUL.
- [GASPING]
- I KNOW THIS PERSON.
- SHIT'S GETTING REAL.
- HA HA HA!
HA HA HA!
[ENGINE REVS]
- OUR MAIN CHALLENGE TODAY
IS TO BE THE GUEST HOST
FOR RUPAUL'S TALK SHOW.
WE HAVE TO INTERVIEW CHAZ BONO
AND GEORGIA HOLT,
AND IT IS A LITTLE BIT
INTIMIDATING.
- CAN YOU IMAGINE HOW MANY
TIMES THEY'VE ANSWERED
THESE SAME QUESTIONS?
- RIGHT.
- SO I'M JUST TRYING TO
MAKE IT LIGHT AND AIRY,
LIKE A FART.
- [LAUGHS]
- HELLO, HELLO, HELLO.
- HI.
- HOW ARE MY HOSTESS
TWINKIES DOING?
- RESEARCH.
- ADORE DELANO, HOW
ARE YOU DOING?
- OK, I'M FREAKING OUT
BECAUSE I WANT IT TO
COME NATURAL.
WHEN I WRITE SHIT DOWN, IT
GETS LIKE,
"OH, GOD, I'M--"
LIKE...
- BUT THIS IS THE THING, AND
THIS TIES INTO THE CRITIQUE
YOU GOT LAST WEEK ON
THE JUDGE'S PANEL, WHICH IS THAT
IF YOU'RE PREPARED,
YOU'LL BE FINE.
- RIGHT.
- ADORE'S REALLY CONFIDENT
IN CERTAIN AREAS, BUT IF IT'S
OUTSIDE OF HER COMFORT ZONE,
SHE KIND OF CRUMBLES.
I DON'T THINK SHE
TRUSTS HERSELF ENOUGH.
- CAN I HEAR A LITTLE
BIT OF YOUR OPENING?
- "HELLO, EVERYONE,
MY NAME IS ADORE DELANO.
"I'LL BE FILLING IN FOR
MISS RUPAUL TONIGHT,
SO I'M GONNA"--
OH, WHAT?
SO--OK, WAIT.
- I'M A BIT WORRIED.
- GET BACK TO
WORK, ALL RIGHT?
- THIS IS GONNA
BE A HOT MESS.
- J-J-J-JOSLYN FOX.
- HEY, RUZIE Q.
- HA HA HA! QUICK QUESTION.
HOW MANY STRAPS ARE YOU
GONNA WEAR FOR THE INTERVIEW?
- ZERO.
- HA HA HA!
BEFORE THIS, DID YOU KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT CHAZ
OR GEORGIA HOLT?
- I LOVE CHAZ WITH
HIS TRANSITION.
I THINK HE'S BEEN VERY
FORTHCOMING, AND GEORGIA I
BECAME FAMILIAR WITH AFTER
THE LIFETIME DOCUMENTARY.
YOU KNOW, SHE LOST THE ROLE
TO MARILYN MONROE
FOR "THE ASPHALT JUNGLE"?
SHE'S SO BEAUTIFUL.
LOVE HER.
- YES.
SO YOUR BIG OPENING--
HAVE YOU WORKED ON THAT?
- I HAVE. I HAVE.
PLEASE WELCOME SOMEONE WHO
CAME OUT OF CHER'S VAGINA
AND THE VAGINA
CHER CAME OUT OF.
- I'M JUST A LITTLE WORRIED
ABOUT, YOU KNOW, MAYBE TALKING
ABOUT CHER'S VAGINA
COULD POSSIBLY OFFEND
MOTHER AND SON.
- BUT THAT'S WHERE
THE ENTERTAINMENT LIES.
- YOU DON'T WANT TO BE
THAT QUEEN THAT PISSED OFF
CHER'S FAMILY.
HELLO?
- LISTEN, WE'RE DOWN TO JUST
VERY FEW GIRLS, AND, YOU KNOW,
WHEN THE GUMBO GETS THINNED
OUT, IT'S A LITTLE TOUGH.
- I LIKE GUMBO, SO...
- HA HA HA!
YOU'VE GOT YOUR WORK
CUT OUT FOR YOU.
GET BACK TO IT.
- SOUNDS GOOD.
- ALL RIGHT.
HA HA HA!
DELA.
- HI, RU.
- SO THIS IS
A BIG CHALLENGE HERE.
- IT IS, YEAH.
- IS THIS CHALLENGE GONNA
ALLOW THE JUDGES TO SEE
THE REAL YOU?
- UM, I...I THINK SO.
I THINK IT'LL BE NICE TO
BE ABLE TO BE BRINGING SOME
VERSION OF THE CHARACTER,
BUT THEY CAN HAVE A GENUINE
CONVERSATION AND
REALLY BE LISTENING.
- RIGHT, AND BECAUSE DELA IS
A CHARACTER THAT YOU DO, I GET
A SENSE THAT YOU'RE
A BIT OF AN INTROVERT.
- I TEND TO BE
VERY PRIVATE MYSELF.
- SO THE QUESTION BECOMES,
WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID
OF PEOPLE SEEING?
- CERTAINLY, I CAN BE
MORE NEGATIVE, YOU KNOW.
I'VE STRUGGLED WITH DEPRESSION
A LOT IN MY LIFE, NOT FEELING
GOOD ENOUGH, NOT FEELING
TOTALLY CONFIDENT.
THIS CHARACTER IS SOMEBODY WHO
HELPED ME TO BE MORE POSITIVE,
AND I'M HOPING THAT NOW I CAN
HAVE HER LEARN FROM ME HOW TO,
YOU KNOW, HAVE MORE OF
THE HEART THAT I THINK THAT
THE JUDGES ARE DESCRIBING.
- ABSOLUTELY, I THINK YOU'RE
RIGHT ON THE MONEY THERE.
ALL RIGHT, GET BACK TO WORK.
- THANK YOU, RU.
- COURTNEY ACT.
- HOWDY, HOWDY.
- HOWDY, HOWDY.
YOU'RE GONNA BE
AN INTERVIEW STAR.
- I KNOW. ISN'T
THAT EXCITING?
- TALK SHOW.
- YEAH.
I HAD A QUESTION.
I'VE BEEN HAVING SO MUCH FUN
IN THE COMPETITION,
AND I ALWAYS FEEL LIKE,
"OH, I'M ON THE RIGHT TRACK.
I'M DOING A GOOD JOB."
AND THEN WHEN I GET TO THE
JUDGES, I KIND OF GET GOOD
FEEDBACK BUT A BIT
KIND OF LUKEWARM.
AND I WAS JUST WONDERING IF
YOU HAD ANY MAYBE SPECIFIC
POINTS OR THINGS THAT I
COULD PAY ATTENTION TO.
- YOU'RE VERY POLISHED.
YOU'VE GOT ALL OF THAT, BUT
AMERICA'S NEXT DRAG SUPERSTAR
ALSO HAS SOFT, TENDER
PARTS AND WHO'S ALSO AS
HARD AS STEEL.
- MMM.
- SO FULLY ROUNDED,
AND THIS IS THE
PERFECT CHALLENGE TO
PUT THAT TO THE TEST.
- RU'S ASKING ME TO GIVE
SOMETHING MORE, LIKE HUMANITY
AND VULNERABILITY, SO I NEED
TO WORK OUT HOW I CAN BRING
THAT INTO THE INTERVIEW.
- TRINITY K. BONET.
OH, MY GOODNESS,
THAT BREAKTHROUGH LAST WEEK.
YOU MUST FEEL ON TOP
OF THE WORLD.
- I DO. I DO.
- WHAT CAN YOU TAKE FROM
THAT BREAKTHROUGH AND APPLY TO
THIS CHALLENGE?
- I THINK THE ADVANTAGE OF
THIS CHALLENGE IS THAT I GET
TO BE MYSELF AND HAVE MY OWN
SENSE OF PERSONALITY AND PLAY
WITH THE QUESTIONS
THE WAY I CHOOSE TO.
- RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.
- I'M ACTUALLY REALLY
EXCITED ABOUT THIS.
- YOU'VE COME VERY CLOSE,
BUT YOU HAVEN'T WON
A CHALLENGE YET.
- NO, AND THAT'S THE GOAL.
RU HAS GIVEN ME QUITE A FEW
CHANCES, SO NOW THAT I FEEL
LIKE I'M IN THE GAME, I
REALLY HAVE TO DO THIS.
- ALL RIGHT,
LADIES, GATHER ROUND.
NOW, TOMORROW ON THE MAIN STAGE,
WE'LL BE JOINED BY OUR
EXTRA SPECIAL GUEST JUDGE.
PAULA ABDUL...
- [GASPING]
- WILL BE HERE.
STRAIGHT UP, Y'ALL.
- PAULA ABDUL JUDGMENT--I WAS
ON "AMERICAN IDOL" ON SEASON 7,
AND TO KNOW THAT SHE'S
GONNA BE HERE TONIGHT SEEING
ME AS A FULL-FLEDGED BEAUTIFUL
WOMAN OF THE OCEAN, I'M REALLY
EXCITED ABOUT THAT.
LIKE, HI, PAULA,
I'M A GIRL NOW.
- NOW, IN A FEW MOMENTS, YOU
WILL HEAD TO THE STUDIO TO
LAUNCH YOUR TV
TALK SHOW CAREERS.
IT'S GONNA BE A REALLY BIG SHOW,
SO DON'T FUCK IT UP.
- HOW ARE YOU FEELING?
- I MEAN, YOU KNOW, IT'S
A LOT TO JUGGLE.
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?
- WHAT'D HE SAY?
- AND HE SAID THAT I'M VERY
POLISHED, BUT THEY'RE NOT
SEEING ANY HUMANNESS TO ME.
- LIKE, OBVIOUSLY, WE LOVE
PEOPLE WHO ARE, LIKE, GREAT
AT THINGS, BUT WE ALSO LOVE
PEOPLE WHO HAVE WEAKNESSES.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?
- 'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT'S
RELATABLE, BUT YOU'RE
AN ALIEN, SO...
- [LAUGHS]
- I KNOW SOMETIMES I CAN
BE TOO POLISHED OR A LITTLE
BIT STEPFORDY.
IT'S NOT LIKE I'M NOT
WILLING TO BE VULNERABLE,
BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING,
I'M JUST HAPPY OR HAPPIER.
I CAN'T HELP IT.
THAT'S KIND OF HOW MY BRAIN
WORKS, OR I'VE--THROUGH A LOT
OF MEDITATION, I FIND THAT
MY LIFE IS VERY CAREFREE.
I HAVE, LIKE, A LOT OF
PASSION AND ENJOYMENT.
- SEE I'M ALREADY ALIENATED
RIGHT NOW TALKING TO YOU.
- HA HA HA!
- COMING UP...
- HELLO, WELCOME
TO "THE RUPAUL SHOW."
- PLEASE WELCOME SOMEONE
WHO HAS COME OUT TWICE SINCE
COMING OUT OF CHER AND SOMEONE
WHO'S CAME BACK 66 YEARS
AFTER CHER CAME OUT OF HER.
- HA HA HA!
HA HA HA!
[ENGINE REVS]
- 5, 4, 3, 2...
- TODAY'S MAIN
CHALLENGE IS TO GUEST HOST
"THE RUPAUL SHOW."
HELLO, WELCOME TO
"THE RUPAUL SHOW."
MY NAME IS ADORE DELANO.
- I'M THE FOXY JOSLYN FOX.
- I AM TRINITY K. BONET,
AND I AM FILLING--
FILLING IN FOR RUPAUL TONIGHT.
- I'M THE FIRST UP
TO INTERVIEW CHAZ BONO
AND GEORGIA HOLT.
THIS IS LIVE TV, SO I JUST AM
KIND OF SHAKING IN MY HEELS.
THIS IS SUCH AN HONOR.
LIKE, I'M FREAKING
OUT RIGHT NOW.
JUST SAY--OW, MY RING GOT
CAUGHT INTO MY FISHNET.
HA HA HA! LET ME SEE.
HMM.
OH, OK.
WELL, LET ME
REFER TO MY NOTES.
I'M STILL FRESH.
SORRY.
SO I READ THAT YOU
WERE PERFORMING
AT THE AGE OF 7.
WERE YOU, LIKE, THE BIG,
LIKE, CHILDHOOD STAR OF YOUR,
LIKE, COMMUNITY?
- NO, HONEY, WE WERE
BROKE, AND IT WAS DURING
THE DEPRESSION.
- PARTY.
MY MOM ALWAYS PUSHES ME,
AND SO, LIKE, I WAS WONDERING,
WELL, DID YOU HAVE,
LIKE, A STAGE DADDY?
'CAUSE I CALL MY
MOM STAGE MAMA.
- I DON'T KNOW HOW
TO EXPLAIN IT TO YOU.
WE HAD NO MONEY.
- OH.
- AND THERE WAS NO FOOD.
SO I WOULD GO AND SING,
AND PEOPLE WOULD GIVE
ME NICKELS AND DIMES AND...
- RIGHT.
I'M HAVING A REALLY HARD TIME
WITH THIS TALK SHOW SHIT.
I DIDN'T KNOW SO
MUCH GOES INTO IT.
I THOUGHT YOU JUST
MEET YOUR GUEST,
YOU HAVE A PARTY,
YOU HAVE A CUTE LITTLE MUG.
I'M LIKE, "FUCK. SHIT'S
GETTING REAL."
OH, THAT'S AMAZING, THOUGH.
- IT WAS DURING
THE DEPRESSION.
- OK.
- YEP, YEAH.
- THAT'S AMAZING.
THAT'S SO COOL.
- IN YOUR ORIGINAL BOOK,
"FAMILY OUTING," YOU DISCUSSED
HOW AT 13 THAT
YOU FELT DIFFERENT.
- RIGHT.
- COULD YOU ELABORATE ON THAT?
- SURE. AS MY
HORMONES STARTED TO GO,
I HAD AN ATTRACTION TOWARDS
WOMEN, AND SO I NATURALLY JUST
MADE THE ASSUMPTION THAT I
MUST BE GAY AND THAT MUST BE
WHAT ALL THESE FEELINGS ARE.
- NOW, OF COURSE,
IN 1995, YOU CAME
OUT PUBLICLY.
WHAT WAS YOUR
FATHER'S THOUGHTS?
- HE WAS COMFORTABLE,
BUT, YOU KNOW, THE FIRST PERSON
IN THE FAMILY THAT I
TALKED TO WAS MY GRANDMA.
- REALLY?
- AND, OF COURSE,
SHE WAS AMAZING.
- AND THEN
THE MAGICAL EXPERIENCE
"DANCING WITH THE STARS."
HOW WAS THAT?
- BIANCA TALKED TO ME
A LOT AND KIND OF IGNORED MY
GRANDMOTHER A LITTLE BIT, SO
I WAS THROWING HER THESE KIND
OF BALLS OF, LIKE, "HERE,
LET'S INCLUDE HER IN THIS."
- WAS IT LIBERATING TO
BE IN THAT MOMENT?
YOU KNOW, LEARNING THE DANCES
AND DEALING WITH ALL OF IT IS
PRETTY GREAT.
OH, GREAT, SO THE STAGE
MANAGER'S TELLING ME I'VE GOT
TO WRAP IT UP, AND I HAVEN'T
ASKED MISS GEORGIA ANYTHING.
THANK YOU, GUYS, SO,
SO VERY MUCH.
SHIT.
- HA HA HA!
- OH, MY GOD.
I'M SO EXCITED, YOU KNOW.
NOT NERVOUS EXCITED,
BUT REALLY EXCITED.
AND I HAVE A TON OF
QUESTIONS FOR YOU GUYS.
WELL, CHAD.
CHAD, I KNOW THAT YOU DO A
LOT IN THE LGBT COMMUNITY.
- TRINITY KEPT CALLING ME
CHAD, AND GOLDEN RULE--YOU GOT
TO KNOW THE NAME OF THE PERSON
THAT YOU'RE INTERVIEWING.
- OK, SO CHAD, ARE YOU
A BOXER OR BRIEF TYPE OF GUY?
- THAT, TO ME, WAS A PROBLEM.
- HA HA HA!
- CHAD, IF YOU HAD
THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO OUT ON A--
ON A DATE WITH MEGAN FOX,
ANGELINA JOLIE, OR--
I NEED ONE MORE PERSON.
IT WAS KIND OF UNCOMFORTABLE.
I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS ME
OR IF IT WAS THEM.
THIS INTERVIEW WAS WEIRD.
HA HA. WELL, THANK YOU
CHAD BONO AND GEORGIA HOLT.
- GEORGIA, OBVIOUSLY, YOU'VE
JUST RELEASED YOUR FIRST
EVER ALBUM.
YOU RECORDED THE ALBUM 30 YEARS
AGO, AND THEN 30 YEARS
LATER, YOU FIND THESE TAPES.
THAT MUST BE KIND OF COOL.
- CHER ASKED ME, "MOM, WHAT'D
YOU DO WITH THOSE TAPES?"
AND I SAID, "HONEY, I THINK
THEY'RE IN THE GARAGE."
- THIS MUST BE A PRETTY
WELL-ORGANIZED GARAGE.
LIKE, 30--
- HA HA HA!
- I MEAN, I'VE GOT THINGS
FROM, YOU KNOW, TWO YEARS AGO
I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY ARE.
- I SAVE EVERYTHING.
- IT'S NOT AN EPISODE OF
"HOARDERS" WAITING TO HAPPEN,
I'M GUESSING. OR IS IT?
- NO.
- NO.
I KNOW THAT YOU'VE JUST DONE
THE DOCUMENTARY "BECOMING CHAZ."
- MM-HMM.
- AND WHAT WAS THE DECISION
THAT MADE YOU WANT TO GO
SO PUBLIC WITH SUCH
A PERSONAL THING?
- YOU KNOW, THERE WAS
A NUMBER OF YEARS WHERE I KNEW I
WAS TRANSGENDER BUT WAS AFRAID
TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.
AND SO IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR
ME TO KIND OF GIVE THAT BACK.
I FIGURED THERE'S OTHER PEOPLE
OUT THERE LIKE ME WHO ARE--
WHO ARE STUCK.
- THAT'S SO COOL.
- COURTNEY CAME ACROSS
VERY PROFESSIONAL
AND VERY LIKEABLE.
I THOUGHT SHE HAD A LOT OF
CHARM, DIDN'T YOU THINK, CHAZ?
- I DID, ABSOLUTELY.
- HA HA HA!
- NO.
I LOVE AUSTRALIAN WOMEN.
A HUGE THING FOR
AUSTRALIAN WOMEN.
- SO, CHAZ, ARE THERE ANY KIND
OF TRAITS THAT YOU WOULD SAY
THAT YOU REALLY KIND OF
PULLED FROM YOUR MOTHER CHER?
- NO.
- NO? HEH.
UM, RIGHT.
NOW, BESIDES THE DROP IN THE
IQ AND REMEMBERING TO PUT THE
SEAT DOWN, HAS THEIR BEEN,
LIKE, HARD THINGS THAT YOU'VE
HAD TO, LIKE, ADJUST
TO NOW BEING A MAN?
- NO, NOT REALLY.
- HA HA HA!
- GEORGIA, ARE THERE ANYTHING
ABOUT, LIKE, THE MUSIC TODAY--
DO YOU--DO YOU CONSIDER,
LIKE, MAYBE DOING A TOUR
OF YOUR ALBUM?
- HA HA HA! NOT AT 87.
- NO?
- NO.
- RIGHT, AND I HAVE ONE MORE
QUESTION FOR YOU, MY DEAR.
ARE YOU...
- HA HA!
I DON'T KNOW, SHE JUST
WAS FUN TO ME.
- BUT SHE SEEMED TO
BE GETTING THROWN.
JEWELRY SEEMED TO BE FALLING
OFF OF HER, AND SHE SEEMED
A LITTLE PHYSICALLY
UNCOMFORTABLE.
- WELL, GEORGIA, WHAT IS IT
LIKE TO HAVE AN ALBUM THAT YOU
RECORDED 31 YEARS AGO
HITTING THE CHARTS RIGHT NOW?
- IT FEELS FANTASTIC.
I STARTED IN SINGING WHEN I
WAS 6 DURING THE DEPRESSION.
- MY GOODNESS.
- YOU'RE WAY TOO YOUNG
TO KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THE DEPRESSION.
- WELL, I'VE
EXPERIENCED OTHER KINDS
OF DEPRESSION, BUT...
- HA HA HA! VERY FUNNY.
- AND, NOW, CHAZ, YOU
ALSO HAVE A RECENT PROJECT,
"INDEPENDENCE DAY."
- YEAH, WE ACTUALLY
CLOSE TONIGHT.
- HAVE YOU GOTTEN A CHANCE
TO SEE CHAZ'S MUSICAL AT ALL?
- I HAVEN'T.
- IT'S CLOSING NIGHT.
- I KNOW IT.
I KNOW IT.
- COULD YOU MAYBE HUM
US A FEW BARS?
MAYBE GEORGIA WILL JUST--
MAYBE SHE COULD GET
A SNEAK PEEK RIGHT NOW?
- VERY FUNNY.
- I ACTUALLY REALLY
LIKED BENDELACREME.
I THOUGHT SHE ASKED SMART
AND INTERESTING QUESTIONS.
- THANK YOU BOTH SO MUCH.
- YOU WERE GOOD.
WELL DONE.
- WELL DONE.
- PLEASE WELCOME SOMEONE
WHO HAS COME OUT TWICE SINCE
COMING OUT OF CHER AND SOMEONE
WHO'S CAME BACK 66 YEARS
AFTER CHER CAME OUT OF HER.
I'M SO LOOKING FORWARD
TO GETTING TO KNOW YOU
BETTER, GEORGIA.
I'M A BIG FAN OF YOURS.
- REALLY?
- I LOVE YOUR CD.
"I'M JUST YOUR YESTERDAY"--
WILL THAT END UP ON CHER'S
NEW ALBUM?
- I DON'T KNOW.
SHE DOESN'T REMEMBER
RECORDING HER PART.
- OK.
- AND I DON'T REMEMBER
RECORDING MY PART.
- OK, WELL, I DON'T
REMEMBER WHAT I HAD
FOR BREAKFAST TODAY,
SO WE'RE EVEN.
HEE HEE HEE. NOW, IF IT WEREN'T
FOR A LAST-MINUTE DECISION
AT THE ABORTION CLINIC,
THE WORLD WOULDN'T
HAVE KNOWN CHER.
ARE YOU PRO LIFE?
HAS YOUR STANCE CHANGED AT
ALL THROUGHOUT YOUR LIFETIME?
- I THINK--I ACTUALLY--
I DON'T--I REALLY DON'T
KNOW HOW I FEEL.
IT WAS A LITTLE BIT
EMBARRASSING TO ME, AND I WAS
TRYING TO THINK OF HOW
TO, YOU KNOW, RECOVER.
- YEAH, IT WAS PUTTING HER
ON THE SPOT IN A WAY THAT YOU
DON'T--YOU KNOW, WHY
WOULD YOU EVER ASK THAT?
- HEE HEE. I FEEL SOME REALLY
GOOD RAPPORT BETWEEN ME,
CHAZ, AND GEORGIA.
IT ALMOST FEELS LIKE I'VE
KNOWN THEM ALL MY LIFE,
AND THEY HAVE NO PROBLEM
OPENING UP TO ME.
THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH.
I'VE GOT THIS ONE IN THE BAG.
HEE HEE. THAT'S ALL THE TIME
WE HAVE, AND I'M ALL OUT
OF DUCT TAPE.
KEEP IT FOXY.
- COMING UP...
WHAT ANIMAL ARE YOU?
- LIKE, A MORTAL
KOMBAT CHARACTER.
- YOU CAME IN MIDDLE
OF THE PACK TO ME.
- HA HA HA!
HA HA HA!
[ENGINE REVS]
HA HA HA!
HA HA HA!
WELCOME TO THE MAIN STAGE
OF "RUPAUL'S DRAG RACE."
MICHELLE VISAGE, CAN WE TALK?
- WE CAN ALWAYS TALK.
- SANTINO RICE,
LET'S HAVE A KIKI.
- HA HA HA!
- AND CHAZ BONO
AND GEORGIA HOLT,
I HOPE MY QUEENS GAVE YOU
THE STAR TREATMENT.
- THEY DID.
THANK YOU.
- I FEEL LIKE A
HONKY TONK WOMAN.
- THAT'S THE NAME OF YOUR
ALBUM, ISN'T IT, GEORGIA?
- YES, IT IS.
- I LOVE "LOVE ME TENDER."
IT'S FANTASTIC.
- THANK YOU.
- AND A POP ICON WHO IS
FOREVER MY GIRL, THE ONE
AND ONLY PAULA ABDUL.
HI, BABY.
- I'M SO HAPPY TO BE HERE.
- NOW, DID YOU KNOW THAT
YOU ARE THE MOST LIP-SYNCHED
ARTIST IN
THE HERSTORY OF "DRAG RACE"?
- THAT'S FANTASTIC NEWS.
I FEEL HONORED.
- THIS WEEK WE CHALLENGED
OUR QUEENS TO BECOME TALK SHOW
HOSTESSES WITH THE MOSTESSES,
AND TONIGHT THEY'RE GOING WILD
ON THE RUNWAY IN THEIR OWN
ANIMAL KINGDOM COUTURE.
I HOPE YOU'RE READY
FOR SOME JUNGLE FEVER.
[LAUGHTER]
- GENTLEMEN, START YOUR
ENGINES, AND MAY THE BEST
WOMAN WIN.
NOW SISSY THAT WALK.
- UP FIRST, DARIENNE LAKE.
MICHELLE, I DIDN'T WANT TO SAY
THIS, BUT THERE'S AN ELEPHANT
IN THE ROOM.
- YES.
- ELEPHANTS ARE LUCKY.
THEY'RE FABULOUS,
AND I'M SERVING YOU ALL OF MY
ELEPHANT GLORY.
- ALL THAT JUNK
IN THAT TRUNK.
- HORTON HEARS A HO.
- HA HA!
- ADORE DELANO.
NICE GRILL.
- YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD GO
GREAT WITH ADORE'S OUTFIT?
- NO.
- A CHIANTI
AND SOME FAVA BEANS.
[LAUGHTER]
- I'M FUCKING SERVING
ANIMAL KINGDOM COUTURE.
I'M FEELING REALLY SEXY.
- "SILENCE OF THE QUEENS."
- I THINK SHE'S MASKING
A LOT OF PAIN.
[LAUGHTER]
- BENDELACREME.
- OH.
- OOH.
WAITER, THERE'S A FLY
ON MY RUNWAY.
[LAUGHTER]
- BE AFRAID.
- YES.
- BE VERY AFRAID.
- YES.
- I'M JUST BUZZING
DOWN THE RUNAWAY.
I'M FEELING THE FANTASY.
- SHE'S GOT SOME
FLY CHOREOGRAPHY.
- YEAH, SHE'S A FLY GIRL.
SHE BUGGING.
NEXT UP, BIANCA DEL RIO,
CHEETAH GIRL.
- CAN A QUEEN REALLY
CHANGE HER SPOTS?
- YOU KNOW THE SAYING--
BIG CATS ARE DANGEROUS,
BUT A LITTLE PUSSY
NEVER HURT ANYBODY.
- THAT IS SOME POINTER
SISTERS HAIR RIGHT THERE.
- SHE'S SO EXCITED.
- HMM.
- NEXT UP, JOSLYN FOX.
SHE'S A RED FOX.
- SHE'S A COCK.
- YES, SHE IS.
- OHH!
- I'VE GOT MY TALONS AND MY
FEATHERS, AND I'M SHOWING OFF
SOME SKIN, AND I'M FEELING
REALLY GOOD ABOUT IT.
- I THINK IT'S SOME KIND
OF JUNGLE PUSSY...CAT.
[LAUGHTER]
- FROM ATLANTA, GEORGIA,
TRINITY K. BONET, THE PHOENIX.
- SHE'S AWFULLY
PLUCKED TONIGHT.
- YES.
- I AM GIVING YOU BIRDS OF
A FEATHER FLOCK TOGETHER
RHYTHMS, AND I LOOK
ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS.
- DRESSED TO QUILL.
YOU BETTER SISSY THAT SQUAWK.
[LAUGHTER]
NEXT UP, COURTNEY ACT.
- OH.
- MM.
- OH, MY GOODNESS.
HEAVEN MUST BE
MISSING AN ANGEL.
- LOOK AT THE SIZE
OF THOSE WINGS.
- YES.
PREPARE FOR TAKEOFF.
- I'M GIVING
SOME REGAL EAGLE.
I WANT TO SEE THIS ON BLOGS.
I WANT TO SEE
THIS ON FACEBOOK.
AIN'T NOBODY GONNA
TOP THIS SHIT.
- MM, THINK I'VE DIED
AND GONE TO HEAVEN.
- UH-HUH.
- YEAH.
BABY, THESE GIRLS ARE
GIVING PRODUCTION VALUE.
- OK.
- NOW SISSY THAT WALK.
WELCOME, LADIES.
IT'S TIME FOR THE
JUDGES' CRITIQUES.
FIRST UP, DARIENNE LAKE.
- WELL, DARIENNE, IT'S COLDER
IN HERE THAN I THOUGHT IT WAS.
- OOH.
[LAUGHTER]
- TONIGHT YOUR
LOOK IS INSPIRED.
I LOVE THE GRAY HAIR,
AND YOUR FACE LOOKS GORGEOUS.
AS FAR AS THE TALK SHOW GOES,
YOU SEEMED REALLY NERVOUS.
- REALLY?
- YOU DID.
- YEAH, I GOT THE SENSE THAT
YOU WERE A LITTLE BIT AWKWARD.
YOU CAME IN MIDDLE OF
THE PACK TO ME.
- ALL RIGHT, NEXT
UP, ADORE DELANO.
- HI.
- WHAT WILD LIFE ANIMAL
ARE YOU REPRESENTING?
- LIKE, A PANTHER,
BUT I ALSO WANTED TO LOOK LIKE
A MORTAL KOMBAT CHARACTER.
- I'M NOT LOVING THIS LOOK.
LOVE THE FACE.
I LOVE YOUR MAKEUP.
I LOVE YOU, BUT ALL THESE
PIECES--IT'S JUST NOT
ELEVATING IT UP ENOUGH.
- I'M HEARING YOU CONVERSE.
I'M GOING,
"I KNOW THIS PERSON."
- SEASON 7 "AMERICAN"--
- YES, "AMERICAN IDOL."
IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU,
BUT WHAT I'D LIKE IS TO
NOT SEE THIS MASK.
IT'S COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO
THE AMAZING PERSONALITY THAT I
REMEMBER SO WELL.
- YOU JUST SEEMED REALLY
NERVOUS DURING OUR INTERVIEW.
- I WAS.
- IT JUST SEEMED LIKE
YOU WERE REALLY STRUGGLING
THROUGH IT.
- ALL RIGHT, NEXT UP,
BENDELACREME,
FLY, FLY, FLY, FLY.
HA HA HA!
- I THINK YOU DID A GREAT
JOB WITH THE INTERVIEWS.
YOU WERE REALLY UP-TO-DATE
ON EVERYTHING THAT BOTH
OF US WERE DOING.
YOU WERE KIND OF LIKE
A BREATH OF FRESH AIR.
- THERE'S A SENSE OF
SOMETHING'S BEEN DROPPED,
AND IT'S SO MUCH
MORE ENDEARING.
- ALL RIGHT, NEXT UP,
BLAME IT ON BIANCA DEL RIO.
- ALWAYS BLAMING ME.
[LAUGHTER]
- I LOVE HOW YOU DID THE BODY
PAINT AND THE FACE PAINT TO
MATCH WITH THE DRESS.
I THINK IT LOOKS GREAT.
- THANK YOU.
- BUT WITH THE INTERVIEW,
YOU WEREN'T REALLY FOCUSING
ON THE OTHER PERSON THAT WAS
THERE, WHICH WAS MY GRANDMA.
- I HAD SOME QUESTIONS FOR
MISS GEORGIA THAT I WANTED TO
ASK, BUT TIME MANAGEMENT
DEFINITELY WAS AN ISSUE.
- IS THERE A QUESTION YOU'D
LIKE TO ASK GEORGIA NOW?
- WELL, I WANTED TO ASK
THEM IF THEY BELIEVE
IN LIFE AFTER LOVE.
[LAUGHTER]
- THANK YOU, BIANCA.
- THANK YOU.
- NEXT UP, JOSLYN FOX
ON THE RUNWAY.
WHAT ANIMAL ARE YOU?
- I'M A GLAMAZONIAN
WARRIOR PRINCESS.
I'M FRIENDS WITH ALL
THE ANIMALS,
AND THEN I TAKE THEM,
AND I SKIN THEM ALIVE.
I'M THE DIANE SAWYER
OF THE JUNGLE.
- I'M NOT SEEING WHAT I
WANT FROM YOU WITH THIS.
IT'S NOT QUITE
ANIMAL ENOUGH.
- NOW, ON TO THE TALK SHOW.
YOU HAD ME WITH YOU, THEN
DECIDED TO GO ALL HARD NEWS.
- HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT ABORTION?
- UH...
- WE DO NOT
DISCUSS THESE THINGS.
REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE AS
A VIEWER WATCHING THAT.
- YOU SAY YOUR CHARACTER
SKINS ANIMALS ALIVE.
WELL, IT FELT LIKE YOU WERE
SKINNING YOUR GUESTS ALIVE.
- HA HA HA!
HA HA HA!
[ENGINE REVS]
- WE DO NOT
DISCUSS THESE THINGS.
REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE AS
A VIEWER WATCHING THAT.
- GEORGIA, WERE YOU OFFENDED?
- I WAS UNEASY.
IT MADE ME UNEASY.
- THAT WILL GO DOWN AS ONE OF
MY BIGGEST MISTAKES I'VE EVER
MADE BECAUSE I JUST ADORE YOU,
AND IT BREAKS MY HEART, AND I
WILL NEVER FORGIVE MYSELF IF
I IN ANY WAY OFFENDED YOU.
- THANK YOU, HONEY.
THANK YOU.
EVERYTHING YOU SAID WAS VERY
SWEET, AND I APPRECIATE IT.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
REALLY GREAT UP UNTIL
THAT ONE REMARK.
- NEXT UP, COURTNEY ACT.
- HOWDY.
- I AM SECURE ENOUGH IN MY
HETEROSEXUALITY TO SAY WOW.
- HA HA AH!
YOU LOOK REALLY CUTE.
I LIKE HANCOCK.
[LAUGHTER]
- THE SECOND I SAW YOU ON
CAMERA, I WAS ENGAGED, AND I
FELT LIKE YOU WERE A
GIRLFRIEND, AND THAT'S REALLY
IMPORTANT TO A VIEWER TO FEEL
LIKE THEY CAN RELATE TO YOU.
- NEXT STOP, TRINITY K. BONET.
- YOUR WHOLE LOOK, EVERYTHING
IS SO WELL THOUGHT OUT.
EVERY LITTLE DETAIL--
JUST GORGEOUS.
- AS FAR AS THE TALK SHOW...
RULE NUMBER ONE, WHEN YOU HAVE
A GUEST, YOU NEED
TO KNOW THEIR NAME.
YOU KEPT CALLING CHAZ "CHAD,"
AND THAT IN AND OF ITSELF
WAS UNCOMFORTABLE.
- WHEN MY NERVES GET THE
BEST OF ME, IT TAKES A TOLL.
- TRINITY, HONEY, I
STARTED WORKING ON TELEVISION
IN 1949, BUT DOING
THE SHOW TODAY, I WAS NERVOUS,
AND I'M AN OLD PRO, YOU KNOW?
SO YOU'LL GET OVER IT,
AND YOU'LL BECOME SO PROUD.
- THAT'S GOOD ADVICE.
THANK YOU.
- MM-HMM.
- I THINK WE'VE HEARD ENOUGH.
WHILE YOU UNWIND IN
THE UNTUCKED LOUNGE,
THE JUDGES
AND I WILL DELIBERATE.
[ENGINE STARTS]
ALL RIGHT, JUST BETWEEN
US CHATTY CATHYS,
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
LET'S START WITH
DARIENNE LAKE.
- I LOVED HER COSTUME, BUT
HER INTERVIEW--I THINK THAT
THE NERVES GOT TO HER.
I REMEMBER THAT SHE GAVE
A CHER IMPERSONATION, AND IT WAS
LIKE YOU COULD HEAR CRICKETS.
[LAUGHTER]
- YEAH, I MEAN, GIVE ME,
YOU KNOW, CHAD MICHAELS OR--
- TOTALLY.
- DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME.
- ALL RIGHT, NEXT UP,
ADORE DELANO.
- I WAS HOPING TO SEE THAT
SAME SASSINESS AND SMART MOUTH
THAT I CAME TO FALL IN LOVE
WITH ON "AMERICAN IDOL,"
BUT I DIDN'T GET
TO SEE IT TODAY.
- SHE WAS SO NERVOUS,
SHE COULDN'T GROUND HERSELF.
I THINK SHE PROBABLY SHOULD
HAVE HAD HER NOTES WRITTEN
SO THAT SHE WOULDN'T
BE CONFUSED.
I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT I
SAID 10 SECONDS AGO.
[LAUGHTER]
- SHE EPITOMIZES THAT YOUNG KID
WHO HASN'T QUITE CONNECTED
THE DOTS WITH HER TALENT, HER
INTELLECT, AND THIS CHALLENGE
REALLY SHOWED THAT, YOU KNOW.
YOU MAKE ONE MISSTEP, AND--
- AND THEN MERLE COMES BACK?
[LAUGHTER]
IS THAT WHAT
YOU'RE TELLING ME?
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S MOVE
ON TO BENDELACREME.
- I THOUGHT HER
COSTUME WAS INCREDIBLE.
SHE EVIDENTLY HAS STUDIED
FLIES WALKING ACROSS
THE FLOOR, BECAUSE SHE
DID IT PERFECT.
- YEAH, WE'RE
SEEING BENDELA NOW.
THERE'S THIS WALL THAT'S
BEEN KIND OF KNOCKED DOWN,
AND THAT TRANSLATED
IN HER TALK SHOW.
DESPITE WEARING THE MOST
HIDEOUS COLOR EVER CREATED...
- HA HA HA!
- SHE WAS FANTASTIC.
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S MOVE ON.
BIANCA DEL RIO.
- THE THING ABOUT BIANCA
IS, SHE'S SO SMART
AND PROFESSIONAL THAT SHE MADE
IT ABOUT THAT, AND SHE FORGOT
ALL THE THINGS THAT YOU
ACTUALLY HAVE TO DO WHEN YOU
DO A TALK SHOW, LIKE
LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE THAT
YOU'RE INTERVIEWING.
- YEAH, IT PROBABLY COMES
WITH BIANCA DEL RIO BEING MORE
OF A NIGHT CLUB HOST WHERE
IF YOU ASK A QUESTION TO THE
AUDIENCE, YOU REALLY DON'T
CARE WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY.
HA HA HA!
- BUT THAT JUST TAKES A
LITTLE BIT OF PRACTICE.
SHE'S GOT ALL THE IMPORTANT
INGREDIENTS TO DO THIS WELL IF
SHE WANTS TO DO
THIS PROFESSIONALLY.
- ALL RIGHT,
UP NEXT, JOSLYN FOX.
- THERE WAS NO ANIMAL
INTERPRETATION
IN THAT WHATSOEVER.
SHE STUCK SOME FEATHERS
ON HER HEAD AND...
- CALLED IT MACARONI.
- OK?
AND I DON'T GIVE
A FRIAR TUCK WHO YOU ARE.
YOU DON'T BE SHOWING
ME THAT WITH A MEATY TUCK
LIKE THAT.
- THAT WAS A MEATY TUCK.
- AS A TALK SHOW HOST, THE
BIGGEST THING WITH HER HOSTING
WAS HER LACK OF TACT,
ESPECIALLY
WITH SENSITIVE ISSUES.
- BUT WHAT I DO APPRECIATE
IS THE FACT THAT WHEN WE DID
BRING THAT UP TO HER TODAY,
SHE WAS TEARFUL ABOUT IT,
AND I FELT THAT THAT
WAS VERY GENUINE OF HER.
- ALL RIGHT, UP NEXT,
COURTNEY ACT.
- DO THE OTHER QUEENS JUST
SHIT BACKSTAGE WHEN SHE PUTS
ON WHAT SHE'S GONNA PUT
ON FOR THE RUNWAY?
BECAUSE THAT IS SO IMPRESSIVE.
- AS FAR AS THE TALK SHOW GOES,
I THOUGHT SHE DID A GOOD JOB,
BUT THEN ONE MINUTE IN,
SHE JUST PLUMMETED ENERGY-WISE.
- I DIDN'T FEEL
THE ENERGY DIP, HONESTLY.
- NOR DID I.
- IT WAS CONVERSATIONAL.
IT JUST WORKED.
- I AGREE.
I JUST THOUGHT SHE WAS
VERY, VERY LIKEABLE AND FUN.
- I WOULD SAY THAT HER
AND BENDELACREME WERE MY TWO
FAVORITE, JUST NECK AND NECK.
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S MOVE
ON TO TRINITY K. BONET.
- LOVED HER RUNWAY LOOK.
IT ALL WORKED TOGETHER.
- BUT IT'S NOT STRONG ENOUGH
TO MAKE UP FOR HOW ABYSMAL HER
TALK SHOW WENT FOR HER.
- RIGHT.
WITH THE BIGGEST FAUX PAS
OF ALL, NOT KNOWING
THE GUEST'S NAME.
- HELLO, SHE CALLED HIM CHAD.
[LAUGHTER]
- SO RULE NUMBER ONE,
KNOW YOUR GUEST'S NAME.
- ALL RIGHT, SILENCE.
I'VE MADE MY DECISION.
BRING BACK MY GIRLS.
[ENGINE REVS]
- HA HA HA!
HA HA HA!
[ENGINE REVS]
WELCOME BACK, LADIES.
I'VE MADE SOME DECISIONS.
BIANCA DEL RIO, YOU ARE SAFE.
BENDELACREME,
YOU ARE SAFE.
COURTNEY ACT, AS A TALK SHOW
HOST, YOU WERE UNFLAPPABLE,
AND ON THE MAIN STAGE,
YOU SOARED.
CONDRAGULATIONS,
YOU ARE THE WINNER OF THIS
WEEK'S CHALLENGE.
- THANK YOU.
[APPLAUSE]
- YOU'VE WON A WIG WARDROBE
FROM OUTFITTERS WIG
AND A YEAR'S SUPPLY
OF HAIR CARE FROM AQUAGE.
- SECOND WIN.
- DARIENNE LAKE...
YOU ARE SAFE.
ADORE DELANO.
YOU, MY DEAR, ARE
ONE WILD CHILD,
BUT IN THIS WEEK'S CHALLENGE,
YOU WERE EATEN ALIVE.
I'M SORRY, MY DEAR,
BUT YOU ARE UP FOR ELIMINATION.
TRINITY K. BONET.
ON THE RUNWAY, YOU ARE
A FIERCE, FEATHERED FIREBIRD.
UNFORTUNATELY, ON THE TALK SHOW,
YOU LAID AN EGG.
JOSLYN FOX, YOUR RUNWAY LOOK
IS A BUNGLE IN THE JUNGLE.
IN THE CHALLENGE, YOU PUT
YOUR HIGH-HEELED FOOT
IN YOUR MOUTH.
JOSLYN FOX...
YOU'RE SAFE.
YOU MAY JOIN
THE OTHER GIRLS.
TRINITY, I'M SORRY,
MY DEAR, BUT YOU ARE UP
FOR ELIMINATION.
- I'M FREAKING OUT BECAUSE
I'VE SEEN TRINITY SEND A LOT
OF BITCHES HOME WITH HER
LIP SYNC SINCE SHE TURNS IT
THE FUCK OUT.
I FEEL LIKE I'M GONNA FAINT.
- LADIES, PRIOR TO TONIGHT,
YOU WERE ASKED TO PREPARE
A LIP-SYNCH PERFORMANCE OF
VIBEOLOGY BY PAULA ABDUL.
THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE TO
IMPRESS ME AND SAVE YOURSELF
FROM ELIMINATION.
THE TIME HAS COME FOR YOU
TO LIP-SYNCH FOR YOUR LIFE.
GOOD LUCK,
AND DON'T FUCK IT UP.
- YEAH!
- THAT WAS THE BEST!
- WOW.
HA HA HA!
LADIES, I'VE
MADE MY DECISION.
ADORE DELANO...
SHANTE, YOU STAY.
- THANK YOU.
- YOU MAY JOIN
THE OTHER GIRLS.
- THANK YOU.
- GORGEOUS,
TALENTED, AND FIERCE.
THE HOLY TRINITY.
- THANK YOU SO MUCH, AND LET
ME TAKE THIS TIME TO SAY THAT
I AM FILLED WITH JOY RIGHT NOW
BECAUSE I HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY
TO TAKE EVERYTHING THAT YOU
HAVE GIVEN ME AND APPLY IT TO
MY LIFE AND START MY NEW
JOURNEY, AND I THANK YOU FROM
THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
- THANK YOU.
NOW, FLY, MY QUEEN,
AND SASHAY AWAY.
[APPLAUSE]
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.
BYE.
THIS IS NOT A DEFEAT FOR ME.
TO ALL MY COMPETITORS,
YOU BITCHES BETTER BRING IT
AND SHINE BRIGHT LIKE
I KNOW YOU ALL CAN.
- CONDRAGULATIONS,
MY SICKENING 6.
IT'S THE PROMISE OF A NEW DAY.
NOW, REMEMBER, IF YOU CAN'T
LOVE YOURSELF, HOW IN THE HELL
YOU GONNA LOVE SOMEBODY ELSE?
CAN I GET AN AMEN IN HERE?
- AMEN.
- ALL RIGHT, NOW,
LET THE MUSIC PLAY.





- PREVIOUSLY
ON "RuPAUL'S DRAG RACE"...
- DID ANY OF THE ORIGINAL 6
WIN TWO CHALLENGES?
- I THINK IT'S BETTER
NOT TO STRUT AROUND
AND BE LIKE A PEACOCK
WHEN YOU WIN.
BENDELACREME.
- YOU'RE GONNA FACE OFF
IN A RAP BATTLE ROYALE.
UGH.
- UH-OH.
- YOU FREAKED YOURSELF OUT.
- THIS IS NOT SOMETHING
THAT I'M ACCUSTOMED TO.
I LIP-SYNCH FOR A LIVING.
THAT'S WHAT I DO.
- COURTNEY ACT,
YOU'RE RESTING ON PRETTY.
DON'T BE A CLICHÉ, MY DEAR.
ADORE DELANO, YOU ARE THE WINNER
OF THIS WEEK'S CHALLENGE.
[APPLAUSE]
- TRINITY K. BONET,
SHANTE, YOU STAY.
MY DEAR MILK, SASHAY AWAY.
- OOH, THAT WAS A TOUGH ONE.
- HOLY CRAP-OLA.
- OH, MILK.
- MILK IS GONE.
- AW.
- IT'S MILKIN' TIME.
- AW.
- POOR LECHE.
- I'M IN THE BOTTOM TWO AGAIN,
AND I'M REALLY FRUSTRATED.
IT'S HARD WHEN
SO MANY OF THE CHALLENGES
ARE SOMETHING THAT
I'M NOT ACCUSTOMED TO
AND SO MANY OF
THE GIRLS HERE ARE.
- CONGRATULATIONS TO MISS THING
ON HER FIRST BIG WIN.
- YEAH.
- YOU DESERVE IT.
- YOU DESERVE IT.
YOU LOOK FABULOUS.
- YEAH, MOTHERFUCKER.
- WHAT AM I, CHOPPED LIVER?
- YOU WERE IN THE TOP 3.
CONGRATULATIONS, MADAM.
- YEAH, CONGRATULATIONS.
- FINALLY.
- SHOWING YOUR SHIT LITERALLY.
- MUST BE JELLY.
- JAM DON'T SHAKE.
- I PURPOSEFULLY DIDN'T GET IN
THE TOP 3 ON THIS ONE
SO I WOULDN'T HAVE TO
STAY ON MY FEET FOR AS LONG.
- AW.
- SOME OF DELA'S WINS HAVE
BOOSTED THE SIZE OF HER HEAD.
HOPEFULLY SHE DOESN'T TIP OVER.
- I WAS KIND OF LIKE
A BIT MIFFED AT RU
SAYING THAT I WAS
RELYING ON PRETTY,
'CAUSE I FEEL LIKE I'VE BEEN
GIVING A LOT OF PERFORMANCE
AND THEATRICS AND OTHER STUFF.
IS RU NOT SEEING
THAT I AM DOING MY BEST?
I MEAN, PERHAPS JUST MY PRETTY
WAS BLINDING HIM,
AND THAT'S ALL HE COULD SEE.
I DEFINITELY THINK
THAT PERFORMANCE IS
MORE IMPORTANT THAN LOOK.
- BUT THAT'S WHAT JUST HAPPENED
WITH MILK.
THEY DIDN'T BEAT MILK UP
AS MUCH FOR THE RAP,
BUT THEY BEAT HIM UP ABOUT
THE RUNWAY LOOK, AND MINE
WAS DEAD ON.
BUT ME AND MILK
WERE IN THE BOTTOM.
- BUT DON'T YOU THINK AT SOME
POINT THEY GET TIRED OF HEARING,
"WELL, THIS ISN'T MY THING.
MAYBE THE NEXT ONE"?
AND IT'S ALWAYS A SITUATION THAT
YOU'RE NOT COMFORTABLE WITH.
IS IT ALWAYS YOUR EXCUSE?
I MEAN, DO YOU NOT FEEL THAT?
- I DON'T KNOW.
- THAT'S ALL THAT I EVER HEAR.
- EVERY TIME
SHE'S IN FRONT OF THE JUDGES,
SHE GOES INTO
THIS LONG, DRAWN-OUT SPEECH
ABOUT HOW SHE TRIES
AND HOW THIS IS NOT HER THING.
I CAN BE SYMPATHETIC
TO A CERTAIN POINT.
IT JUST GETS OLD.
- IT'S NOT HARD FOR YOU
TO COMPLAIN ABOUT SOMETHING
THAT YOU'RE ALREADY GOOD AT,
SO YOU DON'T KNOW HOW I FEEL.
- I'M NOT BEING NASTY ABOUT IT.
I JUST THINK THAT DOES HAVE
SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT.
ARE YOU LISTENING?
I'M TRYING TO HELP TRINITY.
IF SHE DOESN'T CHANGE HER
ATTITUDE, SHE'S NOT GONNA
LAST LONG IN THIS COMPETITION.
- WELL, KISS MY ASS.
- THE WINNER OF
"RuPAUL'S DRAG RACE"
RECEIVES A SICKENING SUPPLY
OF COLOREVOLUTION COSMETICS
AND A CASH PRIZE OF $100,000,
WITH EXTRA SPECIAL GUEST JUDGES
LAINIE KAZAN AND LEAH REMINI.
[TIRES SCREECHING]
[MUSIC]
- GOOD MORN-TING, LA-TIES.
- GOOD MORN-TING.
- 14 QUEENS BEGAN
THIS COMPETITION,
AND ONLY EIGHT REMAIN.
- MILK'S GONE.
GIA'S GONE.
WHO'S GONNA BE NEXT?
[MOUTHING WORDS]
NOT ME.
[SHEMAIL SIREN WAILS]
- OOH, GIRL, YOU GOT SHEMAIL.
- A QUEEN'S EMPIRE HAS TO START
WITH A STRONG FOUNDATION,
A SMOKY EYE, AND A CHERRY LIP.
SO PUT YOUR MONEY
WHERE YOUR MUG IS.
HEY, IT'S WORTH IT,
AND SO AM I.
[LAUGHS]
- A MAKEUP PHOTO SHOOT?
- HELLO, HELLO, HELLO.
- HEY.
- HELLO.
- WOW.
FOR TODAY'S MINI CHALLENGE,
I WANT YOU TO LEND A HAND
TO MICHELLE OBAMA'S
"LET'S MOVE" PROGRAM
BY MAKING FRUITS AND VEGETABLES
SEXY AND APPEALING.
- [GRUNTING RHYTHMICALLY]
- OH, MY GOODNESS,
GET A LOAD OF THAT RUTABAGA.
- [LAUGHTER]
- DELICIOUS.
NOW, YOU NEED TO
DRAG OUT YOUR DIGITS
AND THEN HAND MODEL THIS
FARM-FRESH PRODUCE.
I KNOW I WOULD NAIL
THIS MOTHERFUCKER.
- [LAUGHTER]
- LITERALLY.
LET'S MOVE.
[ENERGETIC POP MUSIC]
- ALL RIGHT, FIRST UP,
BENDELACREME,
SEATTLE'S PREMIER HAND MODEL.
DOES ANYTHING SATISFY
LIKE A BANANA?
ONE SKIN, TWO SKIN,
THREE SKIN, FOUR SKIN.
ARE YOU READY TO BUST
A BUTTERNUT SQUASH?
JOSLYN FOX SHOWING OFF
A PAIR OF CANTALOUPES.
BEFORE YOU BALL IT,
CLEAN IT OUT.
YES. SPANK IT.
BAD MELON.
THE MIGHTY PEANUT
GROWS UNDERGROUND
IN THE RICH SOIL OF AZUSA,
CALIFORNIA.
- [CHUCKLES] RuPAUL OOH, THAT'S
SOME ROUGH NUT PLAY, GIRL.
YEAH, SHUCK IT.
MMM, YOU'VE GOT TO CREAM
THAT CORN. CREAM IT.
THE TRUE CARROT CONNOISSEUR
PREFERS THE LONG,
DEEP IN GIRTH CARROT.
THAT SWEET POTATO IS NICE.
THE DARKER THE SKIN,
THE SWEETER THE POTATO.
UH-HUH!
JUST LIKE DRAG QUEENS,
CUCUMBERS ARE BEST ENJOYED
WHEN THEY'RE YOUNG,
BECAUSE OLDER CUCUMBERS
TEND TO GET BITTER.
- [LAUGHTER]
- NICE WORK, LADIES.
THE WINNER IS...
LAGANJA ESTRANJA.
CONDRAGULATIONS.
THIS WEEK, THE MAIN CHALLENGE
IS PERSONAL.
I AM LAUNCHING
MY FIRST-EVER MAKEUP LINE...
RuPAUL RuPAUL'S GLAMAZON
BY COLOREVOLUTION,
AND I'M ENTRUSTING EACH OF YOU
TO HELP ME MARKET IT.
I NEED YOU TO CREATE
30-SECOND COMMERCIAL CAMPAIGNS
THAT TARGET TODAY'S WOMAN.
YOU'LL BE WORKING IN PAIRS,
AND BECAUSE I OWN 51%
OF THIS DAMN COMPANY,
I'LL BE CASTING YOUR TEAMS.
- SO WE'RE GONNA BE PAIRED UP
WITH SOMEONE,
WHICH IS GOOD, I GUESS.
DEPENDS ON WHO IT IS.
- FIRST UP, ADORE AND LAGANJA.
YOU'LL BE MARKETING
TOWARD MEAN GIRLS,
SPOILED TEENAGERS
OBSESSED WITH BEAUTY
AND TEXTING AND TWEETING
AND TWERKING.
- SECRETLY I AM EXCITED
TO WORK WITH LAGANJA
BECAUSE WHEN
WE'RE NOT COMPETING,
WE'RE, LIKE, REALLY COOL, AND
SHE'S THE COOLEST BITCH EVER.
- AND BECAUSE LAGANJA
WON THE MINI CHALLENGE,
YOU GET EXTRA TIME ON SET.
- SICKENING.
- NEXT, COURTNEY AND JOSLYN.
YOUR TARGET IS HOT MAMAS.
- OOH.
- OOH.
- I IDOLIZED COURTNEY BEFORE
I CAME INTO THIS COMPETITION.
MEETING HER
WAS AN ACCOMPLISHMENT,
SO GETTING TO WORK WITH HER
IS KIND OF SURREAL.
- NEXT, BIANCA AND TRINITY.
- DIDN'T I SAY TO THE UNIVERSE
THAT I DO NOT WANT TO WORK
WITH TRINITY AGAIN?
THANKS, RU, YOU SHADY BITCH.
- I'M ASSIGNING YOU
GLAMOROUS WORKING GIRLS,
FROM HOOKERS TO C.E.O.s.
- I JUST DON'T WANT TO WORK
WITH BIANCA.
I JUST WANT TO WORK BY MYSELF.
I WANT A CHALLENGE WHERE
I COULD JUST THINK ON MY OWN.
- AND THAT LEAVES BENDELACREME
AND DARIENNE LAKE.
- REALLY? REALLY?
- YOU'LL TARGET THE COUGAR DEMO,
MATURE LADIES WHO ONLY GET
SEXIER WITH THE PASSING YEARS.
- I FEEL LIKE THERE'S BEEN
A LITTLE BIT OF TENSION
BETWEEN DARIENNE AND I LATELY,
BUT I THINK THAT
SHE'S SUPER-TALENTED,
SO I THINK THIS IS
A GOOD PAIRING.
- GENTLEMEN, START YOUR ENGINES,
AND MAY THE BEST WOMAN WIN.
- ALL RIGHT, WELL, I JUST--
I'M JUST WRITING, LIKE,
STUPID LITTLE SHIT.
- OK.
- SOMETHING VERY BITCHY FOR
THE DEMOGRAPHIC KIND OF THING.
- RIGHT, LIKE THE MEAN GIRLS,
BUT, LIKE, RICH.
- RICH, BRATTY WHORES.
- ADORE AND I HAVE AN ADVANTAGE
BECAUSE WE'VE WORKED TOGETHER
MANY TIMES IN THE OUTSIDE WORLD.
I'M JUST REALLY NERVOUS
THAT ADORE WILL OVERSHADOW ME
AND THAT I WON'T BE THE STAR.
- "THIS SASSY, SEXY,
SICKENING PRODUCT..."
- [CHUCKLES]
MMM...
- WE COULD SAY,
"NOW THAT WE GOT OUR HANDS
ON THIS BITCHING MAKEUP..."
- [LAUGHS]
FUCK.
SO LAGANJA HAS IDEAS,
AND I MEAN, I WAS RAISED RIGHT,
SO ALL I CAN DO IS
NERVOUS LAUGH AT THEM
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW HOW
TO RESPOND TO THEM.
I'M NOT GONNA SAY, "NO, BITCH,
THAT'S AN AWFUL IDEA.
MINE IS BETTER."
BUT THAT WAS THE TRUTH
OF THE SITUATION.
- "ALL THE HOT BOYS WILL BE
KISSING THESE COATED LIPS,"
OR SOMETHING LIKE...
- UM...I DON'T KNOW.
I WANT TO BE MORE MEAN.
LIKE, "SORRY, STACY,
BUT YOUR BOYFRIEND'S MINE NOW."
- SO, LIKE, I'M PUTTING
ON THE LIP GLOSS,
LIKE, "I CAN SLEEP
WITH ANYONE I CHOOSE."
- SO I'M PICTURING US MAYBE
TO BE, LIKE, DRUNK LUSHES.
- OH, OK.
- YOU KNOW, LIKE...
- HAVE PINOT GRIGIO
IN THE AFTERNOON.
- YEAH, PINOT GRIGIO
IN THE AFTERNOON.
- OK, OK.
- I CANNOT EVEN WRAP MY BRAIN
AROUND IT AT THIS MOMENT
THAT I'M ACTUALLY DOING THIS
THING WITH COURTNEY ACT HERSELF.
SHE HAS SO MUCH RESPECT FOR ME,
AND I, OF COURSE,
HAVE THE UTMOST RESPECT FOR HER.
I THINK, LIKE, WE SHOULD
DO MAKEOVERS, LIKE IN DRAG.
- DOES ONE OF US WANT TO BE.
LIKE, A BEFORE,
AND ONE OF US WANT TO BE AFTER?
- IMAGINE IF YOU'RE THE BEFORE?
- BUT THE PROBLEM IS NO ONE
WOULD EVER BELIEVE THAT YOU
WERE THE AFTER, RIGHT?
[LAUGHS]
- COMING UP...
HOW ARE YOU GONNA SELL
YOUR WORKING GIRL?
- I'M JUST GONNA PUT
MY BEST FOOT FORWARD.
- I DON'T WANT TO HEAR,
"I'M JUST GONNA,"
BECAUSE YOU'VE SAID THAT BEFORE,
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
- I'M NOT GOING TO SIT HERE
AND SELL YOU ANY PROMISES,
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN
WHEN I GET OUT THERE.
[ENGINE REVS]
- [LAUGHS]
[BELL DINGS]
- [LAUGHS]
- OK, GIRL, EVERY BITCH PROP
WE'VE EVER NEEDED--
DOGS, MAKEUP, CELL PHONE--
WE'RE GONNA GIVE IT TO THEM.
- YELLS.
- TODAY OUR MAIN CHALLENGE
IS TO COME UP WITH A CONCEPT
AND SHOOT A 30-SECOND COMMERCIAL
FOR RuPAUL'S
GLAMAZON BY COLOREVOLUTION.
- HELLO, HELLO, HELLO.
- HELLO.
- HELLO.
- WE'RE BUSY HERE.
- IS THIS THE GLAMAZON
SCHOOL OF MODELING?
- WHY, YES, IT IS.
- [LAUGHS]
DELA AND DARIENNE.
- HI.
- HI.
- YOU ALL ARE MARKETING TO?
- COUGARS.
- COUGARS.
- NOW, DO YOU KNOW ANY COUGARS?
- WE ARE COUGARS.
- I'M TOO YOUNG AND PRETTY
TO BE A COUGAR.
- [LAUGHS]
SO...
- AND A LOT OF, YOU KNOW,
COUGARS ARE DELUSIONAL.
- RIGHT, RIGHT.
SO WHAT DO YOU HAVE PLANNED?
- WELL, WHY DON'T YOU START,
'CAUSE WE HAVE
SOME OF THE NOTES HERE?
- OK.
- WE'RE DEFINITELY THINKING
SORT OF THAT--
OH, NO,
I'LL LET YOU START.
- "WHY DON'T YOU START?
UH!"
[LAUGHTER]
- SO HOW'S IT GOING
WORKING WITH DELA?
- WE'RE WORKING TOGETHER AS MUCH
AS POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE CAN,
YOU KNOW, BUT, NO.
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- WE'RE VERY MAGNETIC.
OPPOSITES DO ATTRACT, SO...
- SO ARE YOU OPPOSITES?
- I DON'T THINK WE ARE.
- I THINK WE HAVE DIFFERENT
WORKING STYLES, BUT, UM...
- ALL RIGHT.
SO TELL ME ABOUT
YOUR MARKETING CAMPAIGN.
- WE'RE MARKETING
TO THE MODERN COUGAR
AND THE COUGAR'S BODY
AS A TEMPLE
THAT HAS PROBABLY UNDERGONE
SOME RENOVATIONS...
- SURE.
- BUT COULD USE
A FRESH COAT OF PAINT
TO COVER SOME OF
THE NEWLY REWORKED FOUNDATION.
- OK.
THIS PRODUCT IS VERY, VERY NEAR
AND DEAR TO MY HEART,
SO I WANT YOU TO RESPECT
THE PRODUCT.
- YEAH.
- I'M ABSOLUTELY POSITIVE
IT'S GONNA TURN OUT FANTASTIC.
- ALL RIGHT, GOOD.
JUST SELL MY MAKEUP.
- YES.
- ALL RIGHT, GET BACK TO WORK.
- THANKS.
- THANK YOU, RU.
- ALL RIGHT.
HEY, TRINITY.
HEY, BIANCA.
- HI, HI, HI.
- SO HOW ARE YOU GONNA
SELL MY PRODUCT?
- I AM A C.E.O. WITH 4 CHILDREN,
AND SHE'S A HOOKER.
- [LAUGHS]
- I'M ON MY WAY TO A MEETING,
AND SHE'S ON HER WAY
TO A CUSTOMER.
- UH-HUH.
- AND AS I'M EXPLAINING THE
PRODUCT, SHE TELLS THE WORLD...
- "CHILD, I'M..."
"CHILD, I'M ON THESE STREETS
ALL NIGHT,
"AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT
I KEEP MY SASSY, SEXY LOOK UP.
"I USE MY RuPAUL--
I USE MY RuPAUL'S...
GLAMAZON BY COLOREVOLUTION."
- YOU KNOW, THE JUDGES
HAVE CALLED YOU OUT ON
YOUR CONFIDENCE BEFORE.
HOW ARE YOU GONNA
TURN THAT AROUND?
- I'M JUST GONNA PUT
MY BEST FOOT FORWARD.
- I DON'T WANT TO HEAR,
"I'M JUST GONNA."
- I'M--I--I'M...
- BECAUSE YOU'VE SAID THAT
BEFORE, AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
- I'M NOT GOING TO SIT HERE
AND SELL YOU ANY PROMISES,
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW
EXACTLY WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN
WHEN I GET OUT THERE.
- AM I THE FIRST PERSON
TO CALL YOU OUT ON THIS ISSUE
WITH PROJECTING
AND BEING MORE OUT THERE?
- THIS IS--IT'S HONESTLY
ALL NEW TO ME.
I'VE NEVER HAD A PROBLEM
WITH THE WAY THAT I TALK
OR COMMUNICATION OR ANYTHING.
- BUT IT'S MORE THAN JUST
THE WAY THAT YOU TALK.
IT'S A PROJECTION THING,
YOU KNOW.
I'M TRYING TO DRAG,
PUN INTENDED, YOURSELF OUT,
'CAUSE WHEN I SEE YOU LIP-SYNCH,
I SEE IT THERE.
IT'S THERE.
- EXACTLY.
- YOU HAVE TO TRANSFER
THAT EXACT SAME FIRE
INTO OTHER AREAS.
I KNOW YOU HAVE IT.
IT'S JUST YOU HAVE TO FIGURE OUT
IF YOU'RE WILLING
TO LET THAT WALL DOWN.
I'M COUNTING ON YOU
TO HELP DRAG IT OUT OF HER.
- I'M-A DO IT.
I'M-A DO IT.
WE'RE GONNA WORK IT OUT.
AND YOU GOT IT.
- GET BACK TO WORK.
- WE'LL DO IT.
WE'LL DO IT.
COME ON, WE CAN DO THIS.
SO ALL I'M DOING
IS ENCOURAGING THIS BITCH.
I KNOW SHE HAS WHAT IT TAKES
TO DO THESE CHALLENGES.
SHE JUST NEEDS TO APPLY HERSELF.
- LAGANJA AND ADORE.
- WE'RE ABOUT TO SHOOT
OUR COMMERCIAL
FOR RuPAUL'S GLAMAZON
BY COLOREVOLUTION.
- OUR MEAN TEAM GIRLS.
- AND I THINK WE LOOK
FUCKING COOL.
LIKE, IF WE WENT TO SCHOOL,
WE WOULD RULE THAT SCHOOL.
- SELL ME SOME COSMETICS.
- YES, GOD.
YOU KNOW, I MAY NOT BE
AS FUNNY AS ADORE.
HER PERSONALITY
REALLY DOES SHINE THROUGH.
I JUST REALLY WANT THE JUDGES
TO SEE
THAT I DO HAVE SOMETHING
SPECIAL AND UNIQUE.
- ALL RIGHT, LADIES, ACTION.
- I KNOW ALL THE LOSERS
SITTING ALONE AT LUNCH RIGHT NOW
ARE FEELING SO MUCH SAFER.
- SORRY, STACY,
BUT YOUR BOYFRIEND IS MINE NOW.
- AND CUT.
LAGANJA, I'M WONDERING IF...
[IN VALLEY GIRL VOICE]
WE COULD JUST HAVE
A LITTLE BIT MORE OF,
YOU KNOW...
- OH, MY GOD.
- OH, GOD.
- OH, LIKE MY RACHEL ZOE VOICE.
- NO.
[BELL DINGS]
- NOTHING CAN SATISFY OUR RICH
TASTES IN ADVANCED PRODUCTS.
- BUT NOW, THANKS TO RuPAUL'S
GLAMAZON BY COLOREVOLUTION,
OUR FACES STAND OUT AMONGST THE
TROLLS IN OUR HIGH SCHOOL HALL.
- OK, MOVING ON.
[BEEP]
- BLOW PICTURE.
OH, YEAH.
NOW, SPIN BACK TO CAMERA.
YES.
LOOK OVER THAT SHOULDER
AT THE CAMERA.
TOGETHER.
HA HA!
OK, ONE, TWO, THREE,
LOOK OVER THE SHOULDER.
- WE LOST AN EARRING.
- WORK TOGETHER.
TURN THE OTHER WAY.
- [LAUGHTER]
- CUT.
THAT'S A WRAP, LADIES.
ALL RIGHT, COME ON DOWN.
HOT MAMAS.
- WILL YOU BE OUR MAILMAN?
AND THIS IS YOUR PACKAGE.
- [LAUGHS]
SO YOU ARE
SOME STAY-AT-HOME MOMS
LOOKING FOR SOME GLAMOUR,
IS THAT RIGHT?
- WE'VE MODELED OUR CHARACTERS
ON THE REAL HOUSEWIVES
OF AMERICA.
- SO WHAT CITY
WOULD YOUR HOUSEWIVES BE FROM?
- GLAMAZONIA.
- [SNORTS]
- ALL RIGHT, ACTION.
- YOU KNOW, I WAS WATCHING
THAT "RuPAUL'S DRAG RACE,"
AND I DIDN'T REALIZE
THAT RuPAUL IS A MAN.
- I'VE BEEN WEARING RuPAUL'S
GLAMAZON BY COLOREVOLUTION
FOR MONTHS.
- OH.
- AS A MATTER OF FACT,
I HAVE A SPECIAL DELIVERY
ON THE WAY.
- AND SO WHAT'S GONNA--
WHEN DOES THE MAILMAN COME IN?
- ALL RIGHT,
I WILL YELL "DING-DONG,"
AND WHOEVER'S HOUSE IT IS
IS GONNA SAY, "COME IN."
OK, READY?
- SURE.
- SURE.
- OK, AND ACTION.
- AS A MATTER OF FACT, I HAVE
A SPECIAL DELIVERY ON THE WAY.
- DING-DONG.
AND THEN YOU SAY...
- NICE PACKAGE.
- "COME IN."
- COME IN.
- NOW, DO YOU THINK
I SHOULD BE SAYING "COME IN"
SINCE HE'S DELIVERING...
- WE KIND OF NAILED IT.
COURTNEY, FIRST TIME,
EVERY TIME.
- COMING UP...
- GET THE MOST KICK WITH
A SEXY HIGH-GLOSS LIP SHINE.
[ENGINE REVS]
- [LAUGHS]
[BELL DINGS]
- [LAUGHS]
WELL, LOOK WHO'S HERE.
- HI, THERE, RU.
HI, MICHELLE.
- JUST LIKE JENNIFER COOLIDGE
AND JENNIFER TILLY.
- MEETS COURTNEY STODDEN, YES.
- I AM A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN,
AND I FEEL PRETTY.
- AND...ACTION.
- FEEL SASSY WITH SHADOWS
THAT ACCENTUATE
YOUR NEWLY LIFTED LID.
- GET THE MOST KICK
OUT OF YOUR COLLAGEN
WITH A SEXY HIGH-GLOSS
LIP SHINE.
- [LAUGHS]
ALL RIGHT, AND CUT.
[BEEP]
- CUT.
ALL RIGHT, WE NEED TO WRAP YOURS
IN A WAY WHERE JASON
CAN TAKE IT OFF EASIER.
[BEEP]
- YOUR HEAD'S GOTTEN BIGGER
SINCE LAST TIME YOU DID THIS.
- WELL, YOU'RE ONE TO TALK.
- [SIGHS]
- ACTION.
- WOW.
- OH, SHE'S GORGEOUS.
- [GASPS]
I WONDER HOW THEY GOT
THAT BEAUTIFUL.
- IT MUST BE THAT GLAMAZON.
- OH, YES.
- YES. CUT.
- OUR AD IS MORE TONGUE-IN-CHEEK
BUT DEFINITELY HAS THE POTENTIAL
TO SELL MAKEUP
TO SOME OTHER CRAZY DRAG QUEENS.
- HELLO.
- ALL RIGHT,
THESE ARE THE WORKING GIRLS.
- UH-HUH.
- I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT'S ABOUT TO HAPPEN.
TRINITY STRUGGLES WITH
HER DELIVERY AND CONFIDENCE,
SO I'M FUCKING SCARED.
- ACTION.
- I AM THE C.E.O.
OF A MAJOR CORPORATION
AND THE MOTHER OF TWO,
AND I USE RuPAUL'S GLAMAZON
BY COLOREVOLUTION.
- CUT.
FANTASTIC.
WE'RE GONNA DO THE SAME THING
WITH YOU, OK?
- YOU'VE GOT THIS, RIGHT, GIRL?
- I'M FUCKING PETRIFIED
BECAUSE RU AND MICHELLE
WILL BE DIRECTING ME TODAY,
AND I JUST DON'T SEEM TO DO WELL
WHEN THEY'RE SITTIN'
RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.
- ACTION.
- I AM A PROFESSIONAL HO,
CLIENT FROM CLIENT,
JUMPING OUT OF CAR DO'S.
- JUMPING OUT OF CONDOS?
- CAR DO'S.
- CONDOS?
- NO, CAR DOORS.
- OK. CAR DO'S.
- I THINK I'M TRYING
TO JUST SAY IT FAST ENOUGH
'CAUSE YOU SAID 30 SECONDS.
- ALL RIGHT, BUT WE HAVE
TO UNDERSTAND YOU, BABY.
- REMEMBER, TRINITY,
YOU KNOW YOU CAN DO THIS.
YOU GOT THIS, BITCH.
- BIANCA TOLD ME EARLIER,
"YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE.
YOU'RE GONNA BE ABLE
TO DO THIS, YOU KNOW."
I DECIDED THAT I WOULD JUST
CHANNEL MY INNER BIANCA
AND JUST BLURT IT ALL OUT
AND JUST HAVE FUN WITH IT,
'CAUSE IF NOT,
BIANCA GONNA KILL ME.
- I AM A PROFESSIONAL HO,
FROM CLIENT TO CLIENT,
JUMPING OUT OF CAR DOORS.
BUT WITH RuPAUL'S GLAMAZON
BY COLOREVOLUTION...
- [LAUGHS]
- TRINITY DID
A REALLY GOOD JOB TODAY.
THANK GOD.
I JUST HOPE THAT IT'S
GOOD ENOUGH TO KEEP US SAFE.
- THAT'S A WRAP, LADIES.
- IT'S TIME TO GET
BLACK AND WHITE.
- TODAY IS ELIMINATION DAY,
AND OUR RUNWAY THEME
IS BLACK AND WHITE.
- WHAT KIND OF RUNWAY LOOKS
ARE Y'ALL SERVING TODAY?
- I'M SERVING
SOME KLAUS NOMI REALNESS.
IT'S A VERY DIFFERENT LOOK
FOR COURTNEY.
ALTHOUGH I DID NOTICE
THAT JOSLYN...
- WITH HER LIGHT PURPLE...
- OH, JOSLYN.
JOSLYN AND I ARE SERVING,
LIKE, THE SAME...
- TUXEDO MENSWEAR.
- TUXEDO MENSWEAR LOOK.
- SO IF YOU TWO BOTH LANDED
IN THE BOTTOM TWO
PERFORMING AGAINST EACH OTHER
IN SIMILAR OUTFITS...
[GASPS]
OH, MY.
- JOSLYN WOULD GO HOME.
- [LAUGHTER]
- 'CAUSE SHE'S
A SECOND-RATE COURTNEY, YEAH.
- I THINK IT WAS LOW-RENT.
- SHADY.
- IT'S CLEAR THAT COURTNEY
DOES NOT SEE ME
AT THE SAME LEVEL AS HER.
THIS IS SOMEBODY THAT I IDOLIZE,
AND I'M A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED.
- ON THAT NOTE...
- LET'S GET PRETTY THEN, OK?
- YEAH.
- COME ON, Y'ALL.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- MY EYEBROWS.
- OH.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- WHY YOU DOING IT
ALL IN MY HAIR-REA?
- UM...
- I'M JUST KIDDING.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
- I MEAN, I KNOW IT'S ALL RIGHT.
- DO YOU THINK THEY PAIRED US UP
'CAUSE THEY WERE KINDA LIKE,
"OH, DARIENNE, YOU GOT A BIG
BODY, AND BEN'S GOT A BIG HEAD."
- [LAUGHTER]
- YOU LOVE TO SAY THAT.
I DON'T KNOW
IF THAT'S REALLY TRUE.
- NO, IT'S JUST BECAUSE
YOU MADE THAT COMMENT,
LIKE, AFTER--ABOUT
THE WHOLE WINNING TWICE,
AND I WAS JUST LIKE, "OH, OK."
- SHE TOLD ME SHE HATED YOU.
- [LAUGHTER]
- I REALLY FEEL
SOME PSYCHIC ENERGY
BETWEEN DELA AND DARIENNE.
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON,
BUT I FEEL LIKE THERE'S
SOME TYPE OF TENSION
THAT YOU CAN CUT
WITH A CHEESE KNIFE.
- HOW ARE YOU DOING, GIRL-LINA?
- I FEEL GOOD.
I THINK WE WORKED WELL TOGETHER.
- WE DID WORK WELL TOGETHER.
WE DIDN'T KILL EACH OTHER.
- [CHUCKLES]
- SO THAT WAS GOOD.
YOU KNOW WE DIDN'T SEE
EYE-TO-EYE TO BEGIN WITH.
- 'CAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW YOU.
- RIGHT.
- I JUST FELT LIKE
YOUR PURPOSE HERE
WAS JUST TO COME HERE
AND BE EVIL AND MEAN.
- I APOLOGIZE IF I EVER
CAME ACROSS THAT WAY.
I WAS ANGRY WITH HER BECAUSE HER
WORK ETHIC AND HER ATTITUDE
WASN'T THE SAME AS MINE,
WHICH I LEARNED YOU CAN
STILL WORK WITH PEOPLE
IF THEY COME FROM
A DIFFERENT PLACE.
- IT'S NOT ONLY
MY WAY OR THE HIGHWAY.
I'M LEARNING PATIENCE, BITCH.
- I'M ALSO OBVIOUSLY LEARNING
THAT I HAVE WAYS I GUESS
I NEED TO JUST WORK ON.
- I REALLY THINK TRINITY
HAS COME A LONG WAY,
AND SHE'S TOTALLY OPENED UP.
SHE SHOULD REALLY
BE PROUD OF HERSELF.
I'M PROUD OF HER.
- THIS IS HONESTLY
THE FIRST TIME IN A LONG TIME
I FEEL LIKE I'M WITH
A GROUP OF GIRLS
WHO HAVE TAKEN THE TIME OUT
TO UNDERSTAND ME...
- YEAH.
- AND BE PATIENT WITH ME.
I DEFINITELY AM COMFORTABLE
WITH YOU GIRLS.
- I AM GLAD, YOU STANK BITCH.
- AND I'M GLAD THAT THIS
IS MY SEASON 6 SISTERS...
- THERE YOU GO.
- AND IT'S GONNA BE...
- NOW, DON'T CALL ME COLLECT,
AND IF YOU GO TO JAIL, I KNOW
SOMEBODY THAT CAN GET YOU OUT.
- [LAUGHING]
- [LAUGHS]
AND WHAT?
[APPLAUSE]
WELCOME TO THE MAIN STAGE
OF "RuPAUL'S DRAG RACE."
A WOMAN WHO'S NEVER MET
A LIP LINER SHE DIDN'T LIKE...

SANTINO RICE.

LAINIE KAZAN IS HERE.
HELLO.

YOU LOOK MAGNIFICENT.
- THANK YOU.
AND THE QUEEN OF QUEENS
LEAH REMINI IS HERE.
WE ARE SO HAPPY YOU'RE HERE,
AND I CAN'T BELIEVE I LET YOU
SIT NEXT TO MICHELLE VISAGE.
- [LAUGHTER]
- THIS WEEK OUR QUEENS
WERE CHALLENGED TO CREATE
A PITCH-PERFECT
COSMETICS CAMPAIGN
FOR RuPAUL'S GLAMAZON
BY COLOREVOLUTION,
AND TONIGHT
THEY'RE HITTING THE RUNWAY
SERVING BLACK AND WHITE DRAMA,
MAMA.
GENTLEMEN, START YOUR ENGINES,
AND MAY THE BEST WOMAN WIN.
COMING UP...
- THE LIPSTICK SHOULD STAY ON.
- YES.
- WELL, I DIDN'T GET THAT.
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE
DEFINITELY STONED.
[ENGINE REVS]

[BELL DINGS]

[ENGINE REVS]
UP FIRST, LAGANJA ESTRANJA.

TO EVERY STORY.

IT AIN'T ALL
JUST BLACK AND WHITE.
THERE IS A GRAY AREA.

BLAME IT ON BIANCA DEL RIO.
- AW, THAT'S SO ROMANTIC.
- POOF, THERE IT IS.
- I AM SERVING UP
SKUNK CINDERELLA REALNESS.
THIS IS MY ELEMENT.
I LIKE A GOOD BALL GOWN, AND MY
SHIT AIN'T FROM OFF THE RACK.
- IT'S VERY DRAG
INAUGURATION BALL.
- IT IS.
- THAT IS QUITE
AN IMPRESSIVE TULLE,
I MIGHT ADD.
UP NEXT, TRINITY K. BONET.
- OOH.
- THEY LOOK LIKE DOMINOS.
- TOTALLY.
- YES, HONEY,
SHE WILL DELIVER IN 30 MINUTES,
OR YOUR PIZZA IS FREE.
- [LAUGHS]
- I LOOK ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS.
I'M SERVING YOU JACK OF ALL
TRADES NIGHT AT THE CASINO PITS.
- SHE'S ROLLING SNAKE EYES.
- DOMI-NO, SHE BETTER DO.
- NOW SISSY THAT WALK.
BENDELACREME.
- OH, MY GOODNESS.
LOOK AT THOSE TIT-TITAS.
- NOW, THAT'S
AN HOURGLASS FIGURE.
- I'M SERVING SOME EVIL QUEEN.
I'M FEELING THE FANTASY.
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS
AROUND HER NECK,
BUT IF IT SNOWS TONIGHT,
IT'S GOING ON MY TIRE.
- [LAUGHTER]
- DARIENNE LAKE.
- BLAM.
- I OWN 51% OF THIS COMPANY.
- I'M SERVING YOU BLACK
AND WHITE PAGEANT ELEGANZA.
I WANT YOUR EYES TO CROSS.
- THAT'S A BAZOOM.
- DARIENNE LAKE,
JUMP RIGHT IN.
DON'T FORGET YOUR MOTORBOAT.
BRR-RR-RR-RR.
- [LAUGHS]
- COURTNEY ACT.
OH, MY GOODNESS.
- TALK ABOUT SERVING FISH.
- YEAH, HONEY,
SHE'S SERVING RAINBOW TROUT.
- UH-HUH.
- KLAUS NOMI MALONE.
- YEAH. HA HA!
- WOW.
- I'VE GOT MY FISH
ON THE PLATTER.
I AM SERVING IT TO THOSE JUDGES.
IT'S ALL COME TOGETHER, AND I
FEEL LIKE I'VE GOT IT RIGHT.
- THE INVITATION SAID
BLACK TIE ONLY.
DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT PANTS, THOUGH.
- NO.
- HA HA!
- JOSLYN FOX.
ABRACADABRA.
- OOH, WHOO.
- POOF.
- PRESTO.
- JUST A LITTLE NECKTIE.
- I'M SERVING MENSWEAR.
I'M SHOWING SOME SKIN,
BUT I STILL GOT THAT MASCULINITY
AND FEMININITY.
I'M LOVING IT.
- BAM.
- WHAT?
- THAT ASS IS SO PERFECT.
- I THINK SHE'S STRAPPED
FOR CASH AND FABRIC.
- [LAUGHS]
WELCOME, LADIES. IT'S TIME
TO DEBUT YOUR CAMPAIGNS.
FIRST UP, BIANCA DEL RIO
AND TRINITY K. BONET
TARGETING THE WORKING GIRL.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.
- I'M THE C.E.O.
OF A MAJOR CORPORATION
AND THE MOTHER OF TWO,
SO IN ORDER TO KEEP
MY SICKENING APPEARANCE,
I USE RuPAUL'S GLAMAZON
BY COLOREVOLUTION.
I AM SO MUCH FINER WITH
THIS GLAMOROUS LIQUID LINER.
- I AM A PROFESSIONAL HO,
FROM CLIENT TO CLIENT,
JUMPING OUT OF CAR DOORS.
CAN'T EVEN KEEP MY LIPSTICK ON.
BUT WITH RuPAUL'S GLAMAZON
BY COLOREVOLUTION...BAM!
WITH THIS GLOSS, I AM THE BOSS.
- SO WHETHER YOU'RE
A CORPORATE C.E.O...
- OR A PROFESSIONAL HO.
- YOU DESERVE A GLAMOROUS GLOW.
[LAUGHTER]
- NOW, GET BACK TO WORK, Y'ALL.
- OK.
[CAR HORN HONKS]
- [LAUGHS]
[APPLAUSE]
- SO HOW WAS IT
WORKING TOGETHER?
- MY GAY MOTHER PASSED AWAY,
LIKE, TWO YEARS AGO,
AND HER NAME WAS BIANCA, AND SHE
REMINDS ME SO MUCH OF MY MOTHER.
LIKE, JUST SHUT UP
AND DO WHAT I SAY.
- [LAUGHS]
- AND SHE JUST TOLD ME,
JUST EMBRACE ALL THE
OPPORTUNITIES I HAVE.
HAVE FUN WITH IT.
- WELL, THE RUNWAY--
I THINK YOU ARE BOTH EXQUISITE,
AND THE INFOMERCIAL WAS FUNNY.
I THOUGHT YOUR ACTING
WAS REALLY GOOD.
- WELL, TRINITY, TO ME,
MISSED THE BOAT
IN A PERFECT JOKE FOR YOU
BECAUSE YOU HAVE LIP GLOSS ON.
YOU WERE SELLING WORKING GIRLS,
RIGHT?
DON'T YOU WANT TO KNOW
IT'S GONNA STAY ON
AFTER YOU DO YOUR STUFF?
- WELL, THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID.
- SHE DIDN'T SAY IT SAY IT.
SHE SAID JUMPING
FROM CAR TO CAR...
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT SHE'S DOING IN CAR--
THIS COULD BE THIS.
- SHE HAS HER LIPSTICK ON
'CAUSE SHE'S A PROFESSIONAL HO.
- SO THE LIPSTICK
SHOULD STAY ON!
- SHE SAID IT LASTS
THROUGH ALL THAT.
- I WANT TO KNOW, DID IT STAY ON
THROUGH THE TRICK OR NOT?
- YES!
- WELL, I DIDN'T GET THAT.
- ALL RIGHT THEN.
- YOU TWO MUST KNOW EACH OTHER.
- YES.
- YOU THINK?
- ALL RIGHT, NEXT UP, LAGANJA
ESTRANJA AND ADORE DELANO
TARGETING MEAN TEEN GIRLS.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.
- WE USED TO THINK WE HAD ALL
THE MAKEUP THAT MONEY COULD BUY.
- BUT NOW, THANKS TO RuPAUL'S
GLAMAZON BY COLOREVOLUTION,
OUR FACES STAND OUT AMONGST THE
TROLLS IN OUR HIGH SCHOOL HALLS.
- I KNOW ALL THE LOSERS SITTING
ALONE AT LUNCH RIGHT NOW
ARE FEELING SO MUCH SAFER
'CAUSE WE'RE TOO BUSY
PAINTING OUR OWN FACES
INSTEAD OF THEIRS--
WITH THIS LONG-LASTING MASCARA,
OF COURSE.
SORRY, STACY,
BUT YOUR BOYFRIEND IS NOW MINE.
HE JUST CAN'T RESIST
THIS VITAMIN-INFUSED LIP GLOSS.
BECAUSE WHOEVER SAID BEAUTY
WAS ON THE INSIDE...
- IS UGLY.
- [LAUGHTER]
- I THINK YOU SOLD IT.
IT WAS SHOCKINGLY IRREVERENT
BUT ASPIRATIONAL.
- I WANT TO BUY THE PRODUCT, AND
THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING.
- I THINK YOUR COSTUME--
IT'S A LITTLE TACKY LOOKING.
- YOUR HAIR IS UNEVEN.
IT'S FLOPPING, AND THE CROTCH
IS A LITTLE LOW FOR ME.
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE WAY
YOU LOOK, ADORE.
- YAY.
- YOUR WAIST IS CINCHED.
YOU HAVE LEGS.
YOU'RE NOT CUTTING THEM OFF.
LET'S, LIKE, SAVOR THIS MOMENT.
- I'M A REAL DRAG QUEEN.
- YES. HA HA!
- COMING UP...
- NOT MY FAVORITE AD.
- I HAVE NO IDEA WHO YOU ARE.
- AM I ON ANOTHER SHOW?
[ENGINE REVS]
- [LAUGHS]
[ENGINE REVS]
- NEXT UP, BENDELACREME AND
DARIENNE LAKE TARGETING COUGARS.
[GROWLS]
- THE SIGNS OF AGE--
COSMETIC SURGERY CAN HELP YOU
REBUILD YOUR FOUNDATION.
[BELL DINGS]
- BUT NO RENOVATION IS COMPLETE
WITHOUT A FRESH COAT OF PAINT.
- SHH, YOUR SECRET IS SAFE
WITH RuPAUL'S GLAMAZON
BY COLOREVOLUTION.
- FEEL SASSY WITH SHADOWS
THAT ACCENTUATE THAT
NEWLY LIFTED LID.
- GET THE MOST KICK
OUT OF YOUR COLLAGEN
WITH A HIGH-GLOSS
LIP SHINE.
- BLUSH HELPS TO
ACCENTUATE CHEEKBONES
AND DISTRACT
FROM UNSIGHTLY SCARS.
YOUR BODY IS A TEMPLE.
NOW, "PRAY," COUGAR, "PRAY."
[APPLAUSE]
- I FEEL LIKE IT'S MORE OF
A P.S.A. FOR PLASTIC SURGERY.
- I THOUGHT IT WAS ABOUT EITHER
SURGERY OR DRUGS.
- [LAUGHS]
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE
DEFINITELY STONED.
- [LAUGHTER]
- BENDELA, MY ISSUE IS
I FEEL LIKE EVERY TIME WE'RE
HIDING BEHIND ANOTHER COSTUME.
I HAVE NO IDEA WHO YOU ARE,
AND I WANT TO GET TO KNOW MORE
OF WHO YOU ARE AS A PERSON.
- NEXT UP,
COURTNEY ACT AND JOSLYN FOX
TARGETING STAY-AT-HOME
HOT MAMAS.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.
- I WAS WATCHING
THAT "RuPAUL'S DRAG RACE,"
AND I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT
THAT RuPAUL IS A MAN.
- OH, YOU STUPID BITCH,
OF COURSE RuPAUL IS A MAN.
AND I'VE BEEN WEARING RuPAUL'S
GLAMAZON BY COLOREVOLUTION
FOR MONTHS.
- OH.
- AS A MATTER OF FACT,
I HAVE A SPECIAL DELIVERY
ON THE WAY.
[DOORBELL DINGS]
- COME IN.
NICE PACKAGE.
- AND THE MAKEUP
DOESN'T LOOK TOO BAD EITHER.
- [LAUGHS]
IF IT CAN MAKE A MAN LIKE RuPAUL
LOOK LIKE A GLAMAZON...
- IMAGINE WHAT IT CAN DO FOR
A STAY-AT-HOME MOM LIKE YOU...
OR US.
[LAUGHTER]
- WHAT WAS IT LIKE
WORKING TOGETHER?
- WE'VE GOT, LIKE,
A LITTLE SISTER VIBE GOING.
SHE'S THE LITTLE SISTER.
- I'M THE LOW-RENT VERSION
OF COURTNEY, SO SHE SAYS.
- I MAY HAVE USED
THAT TERM ONCE.
- YOU DIDN'T KNOW
THAT GLAMAZON BY COLOREVOLUTION
WAS MAKEUP UNTIL THE END.
- BUT, COURTNEY, TONIGHT
I THINK THIS KLAUS NOMI
COCKTAIL WAITRESS LOOK
IS AMAZING.
IT'S GORGEOUS.
- UH, JOSLYN, ARE YOU SERIOUS?
YOU JUST WORE THIS IN BLUE,
AND WE JUST TOLD YOU
THERE WAS SO MUCH GOING ON,
AND NOW YOU WORE IT AGAIN.
WHEN YOU TURN AROUND,
THE HAIRLINE--IT'S, BOY.
- I COULD GIVE A CRAP
ABOUT THE HAIR.
I WAS MESMERIZED BY THE ASS.
- ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
WHILE YOU UNWIND
IN THE UNTUCKED LOUNGE,
THE JUDGES AND I
WILL DELIBERATE.
[ENGINE STARTS]
- ALL RIGHT, JUST BETWEEN
US AD EXECUTIVES,
WHAT'D YOU THINK?
LET'S START WITH LAGANJA
ESTRANJA AND ADORE DELANO.
- I THINK AS A GROUP LAGANJA AND
ADORE HAD THE BEST AD FOR ME.
I REALLY THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY.
THEY SOLD THE MAKEUP PRODUCT.
- WHILE BEING BULLIES.
- BUT THAT WAS THEIR CHARACTER,
MICHELLE.
- BUT--YEAH, IT'S PUSHED SO FAR
THAT IT'S FUNNY.
- BUT WITH THAT SAID,
I THINK ADORE WAS
THE STRONGER ONE OF THE TWO
AND PULLED LAGANJA THROUGH.
- ALL RIGHT, NEXT UP,
BIANCA DEL RIO
AND TRINITY K. BONET-NAY.
- I THINK ON THE RUNWAY,
THEY WERE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL,
THE BEST.
- AS FAR AS THE INFOMERCIAL
GOES, THEY GOT THE JOB DONE.
I FEEL LIKE WE SAW
A SIDE OF TRINITY
WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO SEE.
WE GOT TO SEE TRINITY SPEAKING
UP AND REALLY ENJOYING IT,
AND THAT WAS REFRESHING.
- NOT MY FAVORITE AD.
THE BEFORE AND AFTERS--
IT WASN'T THAT BIG
OF A TRANSFORMATION FOR ME.
- I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
UNTIL THIS MOMENT.
- [LAUGHTER]
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S MOVE ON.
BENDELACREME AND DARIENNE LAKE.
- WELL, THE COMMERCIAL--
I MEAN, IT WAS A VERY STRANGE
ATTACK ON THE PRODUCT.
- [LAUGHTER]
- VERY STRANGE ATTACK ON THE...
- IN FACT, I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT
THE PRODUCT WAS, YOU KNOW?
IT WAS A BUTCHERING.
- I DIDN'T KNOW
THEY WERE SELLING MAKEUP.
I FELT LIKE IT WAS
ALL ABOUT THE SURGERY.
THE FACES THEY WERE PULLING
WERE NOT ATTRACTIVE AT ALL.
WE LOVE THOSE FACES,
BUT NOT WHEN YOU'RE
TRYING TO SELL COSMETICS.
- TONIGHT ON THE RUNWAY,
I DID NOT FANCY BENDELACREME.
- THE HAIR LOOKED LIKE A PENIS
WRAPPED IN A BANDAGE.
-  [LAUGHTER]
- IT WAS VERY WEIRD.
- AND I DO NOT KNOW WHO DELA IS
AT ALL EXCEPT A COSTUME QUEEN.
I FEEL LIKE TO BE AMERICA'S
NEXT DRAG SUPERSTAR,
WE NEED TO KNOW THAT THAT PERSON
IS UNDERNEATH ALL OF THAT.
- LET'S TALK ABOUT COURTNEY ACT
AND JOSLYN FOX.
- COURTNEY WAS REALLY FUN
ON THE RUNWAY TONIGHT.
I LOVE THE LOOK SHE WAS GIVING.
JOSLYN--I CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE...
- BUT I THINK YOU CAN BELIEVE
SHE WOULD WEAR THAT.
- WELL, THAT'S TRUE.
THAT'S TRUE.
- AREN'T YOU FROM SOUTH
PLAINFIELD, NEW JERSEY?
- HOLLA.
- [LAUGHS]
- THE POINT, IS YOU JUST WORE
WHAT YOU WORE LAST WEEK
AFTER WE SO HARSHLY CRITIQUED
YOU, IN ANOTHER COLOR?
AND THEN PUT YOUR BOY HAIR ON?
- I DON'T KNOW WHY
WHEN PEOPLE GET CHARACTERS
LIKE STAY-AT-HOME MOM,
THAT AUTOMATICALLY MEANS THAT
THEY HAVE TO BE VERY MATRONLY.
- I THOUGHT
THEY LOOKED STUNNING.
- NO, THEY DIDN'T.
- THEY DIDN'T OVERDO IT.
- I THOUGHT COURTNEY
WAS SO, LIKE, DUMBED DOWN.
- SHE WAS DRAB.
- I THOUGHT
THEY LOOKED STUNNING.
- WELL, SHE DOES
THIS REALNESS THING.
THAT'S WHAT SHE WAS DOING
IN THE COMMERCIAL.
- RIGHT.
- I DON'T WANT REAL.
I WANT A DRAG QUEEN.
- OK, BUT THAT
WASN'T THEIR COMMERCIAL!
- [LAUGHS]
- JESUS, MARY, AND JOSEPH,
AM I ON ANOTHER SHOW?
- NOW, LEAH, YOU LIKE THIS AD.
TELL US WHY.
- I ACTUALLY DIDN'T.
- [LAUGHTER]
- SILENCE.
I'VE MADE MY DECISION.
BRING BACK MY GLAMAZONS.
[ENGINE REVS]
[LAUGHS]
[BELL DINGS]
[LAUGHS]
WELCOME BACK, LADIES.
I'VE MADE SOME DECISIONS.
ADORE AND LAGANJA, THIS WEEK YOU
MEAN GIRLS RULED THE SCHOOL.
CONDRAGULATIONS, YOU'RE THE
WINNER OF THIS WEEK'S CHALLENGE.

- OH, MY GOD, I'M SHOCKED.

[RECORD SCRATCHES]
- OH.
PUSH HER, PLEASE, FOR ME.
- SUCH A NASTY BITCH.
- YOU'LL EACH RECEIVE
A SICKENING SUPPLY OF PRODUCTS
FROM LATHER,
CLEAN SKIN FOR RADIANT LIFE.
- YES.
- I LOVE IT.
- YOU MAY STEP TO THE BACK
OF THE STAGE.
BIANCA DEL RIO,
TRINITY K. BONET,
YOU'RE SAFE.
BENDELACREME, DARIENNE LAKE,
YOUR KOOKY COUGARS GOT LOST
IN THE LIPSTICK JUNGLE.
COURTNEY ACT, JOSLYN FOX,
YOUR HOT MOMMAS DIDN'T
BRING IT HOME TO DADDY.
COURTNEY ACT, JOSLYN FOX,
YOU'RE SAFE.
BENDELACREME, DARIENNE LAKE,
I'M SORRY, MY DEARS,
BUT YOU ARE UP FOR ELIMINATION.
- I'VE BEEN ON THE TOP
SO MUCH IN THIS COMPETITION,
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT THIS MIGHT
BE MY LAST NIGHT HERE.
- TWO QUEENS STAND BEFORE ME.
- LADIES, THIS IS YOUR LAST
CHANCE TO IMPRESS ME AND SAVE
YOURSELF FROM ELIMINATION.
THE TIME HAS COME FOR YOU
TO LIP-SYNCH FOR YOUR LIFE.
[ECHOES]
GOOD LUCK, AND DON'T FUCK IT UP.
- MISS DARIENNE IS TURNING IT,
'CAUSE YOU KNOW
GOOD-GOD-DAMN-WELL
MISS DARIENNE HAD THIS SONG
ON CASSETTE WHEN IT CAME OUT.
SHE KNOWS THE WORDS.
SHE KNOWS THE MOVEMENT.
I'M BANKING ON THAT BITCH.
- DELA IS JUST CATCHING EVERY
BEAT AND WALKING BACK AND FORTH.
SHE'S PEELING OUT OF HER CLOTHES
AND FEELING HER LADYLIKE WAYS.
- [LAUGHS]
- [LAUGHTER]
- [LAUGHS]
OH, MY GOD.
LADIES, I'VE MADE MY DECISION.
DARIENNE LAKE, SHANTE, YOU STAY.
YOU MAY JOIN THE OTHER GIRLS.
BENDELACREME, I KNOW
THIS DIDN'T TURN OUT
THE WAY YOU HAD PLANNED,
BUT I HOPE IT MAKES YOU
AN EVEN FIERCER QUEEN,
BECAUSE YOUR TIME HERE...
IS NOT OVER.
I WANT TO SEE MORE.
BY THE POWER VESTED IN ME BY ME,
SHANTE, YOU STAY.
- YEAH.
- WHOO-OO!
- THERE'S NOTHING I WANT MORE
THAN TO SHOW YOU
EXACTLY WHO I AM.
THANK YOU.
- CONDRAGULATIONS, MY QUEENS.
NOW, REMEMBER,
IF YOU CAN'T LOVE YOURSELF,
HOW IN THE HELL YOU GONNA LOVE
SOMEBODY ELSE?
CAN I GET A AMEN IN HERE?

- AMEN!

GASP!

- EVERYTHING THAT JOSLYN SAID
WAS CUTE, BUT "KEEP IT FOXY,"
THAT WAS HOT.
- WHEN ALL ELSE FAILS,
KEEP IT FOXY. WAH WAH.
- IT'S SORT OF LIKE
A LITTLE CAROL BURNETT,
LIKE TUGGING-ON-THE-EAR
THING MAYBE,
INSTEAD YOU'RE JUST
TAPPING THE TIT.
- YOU'RE GOING TO KEEP IT FOXY?
WAH WAH.

PUNCTUATES HER SENTENCES?
I JUST FOUND OUT
I HAVE CHLAMYDIA.
WAH WAH.

OF A DEAR FRIEND OF MINE
FROM NEW ORLEANS.
SHE'S DEAD.
- IF I WAS GOING

I'D COME INTO YOUR ROOM AT NIGHT
AND CUT UP YOUR FUCKING WIGS.

WITH ONE BREAKOUT PERFORMANCE
AFTER ANOTHER.
LET'S COUNT DOWN THE TOP 4
TEAM TALENT MVPs.
NUMBER 4.
- MY MOTHER IS FROM CUBA,
AND MY DAD IS FROM HONDURAS,
WHICH BASICALLY MEANS
I HAVE A LARGE DICK, NO CREDIT,
AND A TENDENCY TO TAKE THINGS
THAT DON'T BELONG TO ME.
[LAUGHTER]
- I WOULD NEVER WANT
TO SIT FRONT ROW
AT A BIANCA DEL RIO COMEDY SHOW,
BECAUSE SHE'S COMING FOR YOU
AND YOUR WEAVE.
- DO NOT FALL ASLEEP
WHILE BIANCA'S ON STAGE.
- CAN YOU WAKE THAT BITCH UP?
THE ONE
WITH THE HORIZONTAL STRIPES.
NOT A GOOD LOOK IN YOUR
THIRD TRIMESTER, SIR, ALL RIGHT?
[LAUGHTER]

TO READ ME, EVER,
OR EVEN LOOK AT ME.
- NOT TODAY, SATAN, NOT TODAY.

BITCH SLAYED. GO ON AHEAD.

AND I KNOW RAP.
STOP RELYING

THE HOUSE DOWN, THE HOUSE DOWN.

I HAD TURNED ON

AND SO FREAKING ADORABLE,
AND BEAUTIFUL, AND SPOT-ON.
SHE'S MY VIP TONIGHT.

AND COURTNEY ACT
WAS A PERFECT ADELE DAZEEM.

- WELL, RUPLE...RUPLE, IS IT?
- IT'S SO FUNNY
ABOUT THESE SEATTLE GIRLS
NOT REALLY BEING TAKEN SERIOUSLY
UNTIL SNATCH GAME.

NEXT TIME FOR THE SHOW?

WE ORIGINATED THE LANGUAGE.
[LAUGHTER]
- CITRUS, COULD YOU IMAGINE
SUCH A THING?
- NOW, YOU DO AN ENGLISH ACCENT?
- YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO DO ONE, IF I'M HONEST.
- I DON'T BELIEVE FOR A SECOND
THAT BENDELACREME
DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO DO
A BRITISH ACCENT.
LIES! LIZA MINELLI'S
SISTER, LORNA LUFT.

- NOW, I KNOW BENDELACREME
MAY HAVE WON THE CHALLENGE,
BUT ADORE
BLEW IT OUT OF THE WATER.

WTF CHALLENGE MOMENTS.

IT WAS LIKE
MY RELATIONSHIP WITH SHARON.
- [GASP]
- I'M THE BOTTOM.
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HALF THESE CHALLENGES
HAVE TO DO WITH ANYTHING,
BUT I AM SO ENTERTAINED.
- I MIGHT FART ON YOUR STOMACH.
- THAT'S OKAY.
- I WAS VERY NERVOUS
WHEN I SAW VIVACIOUS
LAYING IN THE SAND,
BECAUSE I THOUGHT FOR SURE
GREENPEACE WAS GOING TO COME
AND HARPOON HER.
- NUMBER 2.
OH, SCRUFF PIT CREW.

IN A GAME OF HUNGMAN.

TO JUMP OFF A HIGH PLATFORM
AND STRIKE A GLAMOROUS POSE.
- OH, AND THEN THE OTHER GIRLS
GOT TO HAVE A FUN PILLOW FIGHT
WITH A BUNCH OF NAKED MEN.
LEAPING TO MY DEATH
OR BEING IN A BED
WITH LOTS OF MEN.
I DON'T KNOW.

THEY HAVEN'T DONE YET
IS SET FIRE TO THE QUEENS.

IS LIKE A PETITE CLUTCH
FOR A DRAG QUEEN,
BECAUSE IT DO
TAKE A LOT TO LOOK LIKE THIS.
- I GOT A LITTLE BRUSH.
- IS THIS YOUR BABY?
- I GOT A LITTLE TILAPIA
IN HERE.
- YOU KNOW WHAT
WOULD'VE MADE IT BETTER?
IS IF THE PURSE ROLLED IN
AND THEN STOPPED,
AND THEN SHE GOT OUT OF IT,
AND THEN PICKED IT UP
AND WALKED OUT,
BECAUSE IT WAS BIG ENOUGH.
- COME ON NOW.
IT IS A KNOWN FACT
THAT A WOMAN DO CARRY
AN EVENING BAG
AT A DINNER PARTY.
NUMBER 3.
- OH, THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL.
WITH THE YELLOW IN THE UMBRELLA

THAT WAS GORGEOUS.
SHE LOOKED STUNNING.
- IF YOU CAN JUST WALK AROUND
WITH YOUR OWN SPECIAL EFFECTS,
AND JUST HAVE RAIN FALLING
ON YOU, LIKE, IT'S GREAT.
- THIS RUNWAY LOOK
WAS A LITTLE MISLEADING, THOUGH,
BECAUSE I THOUGHT HER NAME
SHOULD HAVE BEEN APRIL SHOWERS.
- MAKE IT RAIN, GIRL.
MAKE IT RAIN.
NUMBER 2.
- COURTNEY'S CHARACTER
IN THE RUSICAL
GOT ADDICTED TO FISH OIL.

ORNACIA PLUS ONE.
I LOVE THIS SONG,
ORNACIA, DON'T YOU?
OH, MY GOD, THIS DJ
IS REALLY GREAT.

OF THE SHOW REALLY MADE ME WET.
IN THE EYE.
GET YOUR MIND OUT OF THE GUTTER.
PERVERT.
THE TOP 5 MOMENTS
THAT MADE US FEEL THINGS.
NUMBER 5.
- THANK YOU.
- MILK GOT REALLY CHOKED UP
WHEN SHE LEFT.
- I JUST WANT
TO THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR ALLOWING ME
TO BE WHO I AM
WITHOUT FEAR OF BEING RIDICULED.
- MILK GETS ELIMINATED,
AND IT'S SUCH A SHAME,
THE ONE TIME
SHE LOOKS LIKE A WOMAN,
AND SHE GETS SENT HOME,
WHAT THE HELL?
- IF YOU LOVE YOURSELF
AND ARE HAPPY
WITH WHAT YOU'RE CONTRIBUTING
TO THE WORLD,
THEN NO ONE
CAN FAULT YOU FOR THAT.

IN MY LIFE
TO BE A DRAG QUEEN,
WHEN I'M...
- BREATHE, BREATHE.
- IF YOU ARE GOING TO CRY
THAT FUCKING MUCH,
GET A BETTER DAMN LASH ADHESIVE
AND WATERPROOF
FUCKING MASCARA.
- THE 5 Gs: GOOD GOD,
GANJA, GET A GRIP.
- THIS IS JUST TOO FUCKING MUCH.
YOU BROKE ME DOWN,
I FEEL LIKE SHIT,
I LOOK STUPID.
GOD, THIS FUCKING SUCKS.
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT TOOK
ALL THE TIME TO EPISODE 8
FOR PEOPLE TO TELL LAGANJA
THAT HER VOICE WAS ANNOYING.
COME ON! OKAY?
- THAT'S NOT FAIR, I'M SORRY,
WE ALL HAVE DIFFERENT VOICES,

I'VE BEEN TOLD MY WHOLE LIFE
MY VOICE WAS ANNOYING,
AND, YOU KNOW, NOW,
IT'S HOW I MAKE MY MONEYS.

WHICH I THINK
IS EXTREMELY BRAVE.
- I MISS YOU AND I LOVE YOU.
YOU TOLD ME
WHEN YOU WERE LITTLE,
"I'M GOING TO BE A STAR,
I'M GOING TO BE ON TV."
SO HERE WE ARE.
- THE FACT
THAT TRINITY K. BONET'S MOTHER
SENT THAT BEAUTIFUL MESSAGE
AND THE FACT
THAT SHE JUST SEEMED,
LIKE, SO TEAM TRINITY,
I LOVE THAT.
I THINK ALL MOTHERS
SHOULD BE THAT OPEN
AND LOVING TO THEIR KIDS.
IT WAS SO GREAT TO SEE.
- NUMBER 1.
HERE COMES THE BRIDE.
- [FAKE CRYING]
- [LAUGHTER]
- AND SOME PEOPLE
SHED REAL TEARS.
- I BELIEVE
EVERY LIVING CREATURE
IN THE UNIVERSE
DESERVES THE RIGHT TO LOVE
AND TO BE HAPPY.
AND I'M FINALLY GOING HOME
TO PLAN MY OWN WEDDING, FINALLY.
[SIGHS]
- THAT'S CUTE. LITTLE
MISS JOSLYN'S ALL EMOTIONAL,
BECAUSE SHE HAS TO MAKE OVER
THESE WEDDING COUPLES,
AND SHE'S ENGAGED.
THAT'S SPECIAL.
I KNOW I BETTER
HAVE AN INVITATION.

THANKS, BRANDONNA.
[LAUGHS]

SO IS THAT HER TAIL THAT'S--

- NUMBER 9, LAGANJA ESTRANJA.
- LAGANJA, LADY GAGA CALLED.
SHE WANTS HER HAT BACK.
- NUMBER 8, TRINITY K. BONET.
- I ALWAYS TRAVEL
WITH A SATELLITE DISH,
BECAUSE YOU GET MORE CHANNELS.
- NUMBER 7, BENDELACREME.
- NOW, I'M NOT BIASED,
BUT BENDELACREME
IS THE MOST GORGEOUS GIRL
TO EVER POUNCE THAT RUNWAY.
IT'S LIKE LOOKING IN A MIRROR.
A FUNHOUSE MIRROR.
YOU KNOW,
ONE THAT MAKES ME LOOK THIN.
- NUMBER 6, BIANCA DEL RIO.
- WHO PUTS A STREAK
IN THEIR WIG?
I MEAN, WHO DOES THAT?
THAT'S SO 3 SEASON AGO.
- NUMBER 5, VI-VI-VIVACIOUS.
- VIVACIOUS' SPIKE OUTFIT
LOOKED LIKE A MICROSCOPIC IMAGE
OF A SYPHILIS SPORE.
- NUMBER 4, JOSLYN FOX.
- I THINK JOSLYN'S ASS
IS HER BEST OUTFIT.
OH, MY GOD, THAT'S SO SHADY.
- NUMBER 3, ADORE IN DIAMONDS.
- IT LOOKS LIKE TONYA HARDING
IS GOING TO CHASE AFTER HER
WITH A CROWBAR ANY MINUTE.
- NUMBER 2, MILK.
- MILK CAME OUT ON THE RUNWAY
DRESSED AS MOTHERFUCKING
PINOCCHIO, BITCH.
NOW, THAT'S HOW YOU DO IT.
- NUMBER 1, COURTNEY ACT.
- COURTNEY ACT AS A BIRD.
YES, BITCH.
- I THOUGHT THAT COURTNEY
WAS ACTUALLY GOING
TO TAKE FLIGHT
OFF THE STAGE
AND TAKE MICHELLE VISAGE'S
LACE FRONT WITH HER.
- THAT'S IT? THAT'S EVERYTHING?
YOU'VE LOOKED
AT THE EDITING FLOOR
AND THAT'S ALL YOU HAVE FOR ME?
- WE CAN'T FORGET RU'S
TOP 12 TURNT-OUT LOOKS, HUNTIES.
- [LAUGHS]
- MISS RU WORE EVERY LOOK
POSSIBLE THIS SEASON,
AND THEY WERE ALL TURNT-OUT.
- RU'S OUTFITS ARE ANNOYING,
BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL
FUCKING BEAUTIFUL,
AND I HATE HER.
- YOU'RE SWEET. I LOVE YOU.
THE TOP 5 JUDGE MENTAL MOMENTS.
- THE JUDGES GOT INTO IT
THIS SEASON, HONEY.
THEY WERE TELLING IT LIKE IT IS.
- NUMBER 5.
- I CAN SEE ADAM LAMBERT
WATCHING THESE THIGHS.
HE WANTS SOME CHICKEN LEG.
I KNOW IT.
- ADAM AND APRIL CARRION
SITTING IN A TREE,
DOING SOMETHING WE CAN'T SEE.
- YOU ARE GORGEOUS.
- YOU'RE GORGEOUS AS WELL.
- OH, THANK YOU.
- GET A ROOM.
- BUT YOU CAN HEAR IT, AND IT
PROBABLY SOUNDS LIKE THIS.
[SUCKING NOISE]
AHH...
- NUMBER 4, THE OG DREAM GIRL,
SHERYL LEE RALPH.
- LOVE THE ORIGINAL DREAM GIRL.
COME ON, IT DOESN'T
GET BETTER THAN THAT,
AND SHE DON'T MIND TELLING IT
LIKE IT IS, EITHER.
- IT'S LIKE YOU HAVE A BEARD
ON YOUR FOREHEAD.
AIN'T NOBODY GOT TIME FOR THAT.
PUT A CORK IN IT.
- PUT A CORK IN IT. I WAS LIKE--
- LITERALLY, SPEAK
WITH THAT CORK IN THE MOUTH.
IT WILL DO WONDERS
FOR ENUNCIATION.
- IT HELPS YOU ENUNCIATE
YOUR WORDS,
AND PEOPLE
CAN UNDERSTAND YOU BETTER.
- NUMBER 3, LEAH REMINI IS HERE.
- SO THE LIPSTICK
SHOULD STAY ON.
- SHE SAID IT LASTS
THROUGH ALL THAT.
- I LOVE LEAH REMINI AS A JUDGE,
SHE AND MICHELLE ARE JUST
LIKE THOSE TWO MUPPETS
WHO JUST
READ THE SHOW FOR FILTH.
- WHEN LEAH REMINI
AND MICHELLE VISAGE
WERE GETTING INTO IT, HONEY,
I WAS LIKE, "CAN THIS BE
THE 'UNTUCKED' EPISODE, PLEASE?"
- DID IT STAY ON
THROUGH THE TRICK OR NOT?
- YES.
- WELL, I DIDN'T GET THAT.
- ALL RIGHT, THEN.
- YEAH, YOU WERE
ON THE KING OF QUEENS?
I'M THE QUEEN OF QUEENS.
- I THOUGHT THEY WERE TRYING
TO BE TOO FUNNY,
THEY WERE TRYING
TO OUTDO EACH OTHER,
AND THAT'S NOT A TEAM PLAYER.
- I'LL GIVE YOU THAT.
YEAH, I'LL GIVE YOU THAT.
- HALLELUJAH.
- SO THEY CREATED A CHARACTER--
- PAUSE. ONE SECOND, RU.
- OKAY.
- MICHELLE JUST
SAID I WAS RIGHT,
SO IF WE COULD
JUST TAKE A MOMENT.
- I'LL GIVE YOU THAT.
- [LAUGHTER]
- SPEAKING OF SISTERHOODS,
YOU HAVE MICHELLE VISAGE
AND SANTINO RICE GOING AT IT
LIKE THEY'RE HAVING
THEIR OWN FREAKING QUARRELS.
I--DO THEY JUST NOT
AGREE ON ANYTHING?
- NUMBER 2.
- HE WANTS TO SAY
WHATEVER I SAY, THE OPPOSITE.
- NO, I DON'T.
I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU SAY.
- I THINK
THAT MICHELLE AND SANTINO
ARE DEFINITELY FIGHTING
A LITTLE BIT MORE THIS YEAR,
BECAUSE I'VE SEEN
A 33% INCREASE IN SIDE EYE.
- IT WAS GREAT TO SEE BIANCA
DEL NERO IN THAT LIGHT.
- OR DEL RIO.
- I ACTUALLY THOUGHT IT WAS LIKE
WATCHING BIANCA DEL NERO'S PAST.
- DEL RIO?
- WHAT'D I SAY?
- DEL NERO.
- NO, DEL RIO.
- THIS IS THE SECOND TIME
YOU'VE SAID--
DEL NERO.
- I WOULD NEVER SAY "DEL NERO."
- YOU SAID IT TWO TIMES.
GO TO THE TAPE.
- WE HEARD YOU SAY IT TWICE.
- SHUT THE FUCK--NO.
- YOU'RE FUCKING CRAZY
IF YOU THINK YOU DIDN'T SAY IT.
- I ACTUALLY THOUGHT
WE WERE WATCHING
A TAPE FROM BIANCA DEL NERO.
[LAUGHS]
NOW YOU'RE NODDING,
YOU JUST SAID.
- THIRD TIME.
- I DIDN'T SAY THAT.
- WHAT'S A DEL NERO?
- I DON'T KNOW,
BUT IT SOUNDS DELICIOUS.
NUMBER 1. "DRAG RACE"
SUPER FAN KHLOE KARDASHIAN.
- KHLOE KARDASHIAN
IS SORT OF LIKE
THE HONEY BADGER OF DRAG.
SHE DOESN'T CARE.
- BASIC BITCHES NOT WANTED.
I HAVE A VERY BIG CAMEL TOE.
MY PUSS IS VERY LARGE
AND IN CHARGE.
I'M A BIG GIRL.
- I LOVE ANYBODY'S WHO'S GOT
A LARGE AND IN-CHARGE PUSS.
- HASHTAG NO FILTER.
- NOW, DURING KHLOE KARDASHIAN'S
SECOND APPEARANCE THIS SEASON,
SHE PERFORMED ON THE MAIN STAGE
WITH RAVEN AND MANILA.
THE SEQUENCE WAS SUPPOSED TO AIR
ON "KEEPING UP
WITH THE KARDASHIANS,"
SO THIS FOOTAGE IS SO EXCLUSIVE,
IT GOT CUT FROM NOT JUST ONE,
BUT TWO SHOWS.
LOOK AT THAT BODY,
MY GOD, IT'S GORGEOUS.
- WHICH ONE? ME? OH.
- YOUR PADS ARE AMAZING.
- [LAUGHS]
- YES.
- I NEVER THOUGHT
I'D BE LIP-SYNCHING
ON THE STAGE
OF "RUPAUL'S DRAG RACE" AGAIN.
KHLOE KARDASHIAN,
SHANTE YOU STAY.
- WHOO! THANK YOU, BOO.
- RAVEN AND I LOST
TO KHLOE KARDASHIAN.
DAMN.
- UP NEXT,
THE TOP 5 SMACKDOWNS.
- YES, GOD, NESSA.
- ONE FINAL LOOK
AT OUR TOP 3 QUEENS.
AND WHY ARE THESE QUEENS
BLINDFOLDED?
- BITCH, GET INTO IT.
- FIND OUT
AS "RUPAUL'S DRAG RACE:
COUNTDOWN TO THE CROWN"
CONTINUES.
[LAUGHS]
WELCOME BACK TO "RUPAUL'S DRAG
RACE: COUNTDOWN TO THE CROWN."
NOW, HERE
AT THE "DRAG RACE,"
WE'RE ONE BIG HAPPY FAMILY.
AND LIKE EVERY FAMILY,
WELL, SOMETIMES
SHIT DO GET REAL.
THE TOP 5 SMACKDOWNS.
NUMBER 5.
- BITCH, ANYBODY THAT COMES
DOWN THE RUNWAY
LOOKING LIKE THAT,
THINKING THAT THE TONY AWARDS,
I WANT TO GET INTO YOUR BRAIN,
SO WHAT'S GOING ON?
- GIA IS VERY ONE-SIDED
WITH HER IDEA OF DRAG.
I COULD GO OFF
ON THE NUMBER OF THINGS
THAT SHE NEEDS TO FIX,
BUT I'D RATHER NOT.
- GIA'S DRAG IS ALL
ABOUT BEING FISHY,
GIVING THE ILLUSION OF A WOMAN,
AND MILK'S DRAG
IS KIND OF OPPOSITE THAT.
- I LOVE MILK'S DRAG.
I THINK THERE'S
AN AUTHENTICITY TO IT.
IT'S JUST HIS OWN PARTICULAR
THING, AND I LIVE.
I COMPLETELY LIVE FOR MILK.
- JUST GOT OFF THE BOAT,
YOU KNOW,
A LITTLE TRIP FROM ASIA.
JUST LANDED LIKE FRESH TILAPIA.
- WHY'S SHE SO PROUD OF TILAPIA?
IT'S LIKE THE CHEAPEST FISH.
- SASHAY AWAY.
- YOU GUYS ARE ALL STILL DUDES.
- NUMBER 4.
- NICE TO MEET YOU, COURTNEY.
I'M A BIG FAN OF YOURS.
MY NAME'S JOSLYN FOX.
- WHEN WE NEED A LOW-RENT
VERSION OF COURTNEY ACT,
WE'LL LET YOU KNOW.
[LAUGHTER]
- SOMETIMES IT'S GREAT
TO MEET YOUR IDOL,
AND SOMETIMES IT'S NOT.
- YOUR DRAG ISN'T AS POLISHED
AS OTHER DRAG
IN THE COMPETITION RIGHT NOW.
I'M NOT BEING MEAN.
I'M JUST BEING FACTUAL,
BUT I DIDN'T MEAN IT
IN ANY WAY TO HURT HER FEELINGS.
- IT WAS VERY BIG SISTER,
LITTLE SISTER, YOU KNOW?
THE LITTLE SISTER
IDOLIZING THE BIG SISTER,
AND THEN SHE WAKES UP
AND REALIZES THAT IT'S A MAN.
[LAUGHS]
- I'VE GOT MY LACE FRONT
GLUED DOWN.
I DO GLANCE OVER
AND NOTICE JOSLYN
GIVING A LITTLE SIDEBURN ACTION.
WE'LL HAVE TO GET HER
INTO A NICE LACE FRONT WIG.
- NUMBER 3.
- YOU WON A CHALLENGE.
- I WON THE FIRST CHALLENGE TOO.
- OH YOU DID? OH.
- I DID.
- I WASN'T THERE.
YEAH, IT DOESN'T COUNT.
- HONEY,
I DIDN'T HAVE MY GLASSES ON,
SO I DIDN'T SEE THE ULTIMATE
SHADE SHOWDOWN COMING.
- WHY DID DARIENNE HATE
BEN SO MUCH?
- DARIENNE,
WHY DIDN'T YOU CHOOSE ME?
- IT'S NONE
OF YOUR FUCKING BUSINESS.
- OOH!
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT INTIMIDATES A GIRL MORE,
THE GIRLS WHO ARE GOOD
AT THE THINGS
THEY'RE NOT GOOD AT,
OR THE GIRLS WHO ARE GOOD
AT THE THINGS THEY'RE GOOD AT.
- I'M TOO YOUNG AND PRETTY
TO BE A COUGAR.
- [LAUGHS]
- AND A LOT OF, YOU KNOW,
COUGARS ARE DELUSIONAL.
- DARIENNE DOES NOT LIKE DELA,
AND YOU KNOW WHY?
IT'S NONE
OF YOUR FUCKING BUSINESS.
- I'M NOT A MONSTER.
- NUMBER 2.
- I DO FEEL A LITTLE BIT SHAFTED
BY YOU TODAY.
- WHEN?
- I DON'T REMEMBER
THE EXACT COMMENT YOU SAID.
- WHAT DID SHE SAY, LAGANJA?
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT SHE SAID.
- I TRIED
TO FIGURE IT OUT, LIKE,
WHAT IT IS I THOUGHT YOU SAID,
AND I THINK IT WAS JUST, LIKE,
THE FACT THAT, YOU KNOW,
I WAS JUST REALLY EMOTIONAL
AND DISTRAUGHT AND ALREADY DOWN.
- BUT I FELT LIKE AT ONE POINT,
MAYBE EARLIER,
OR MAYBE YESTERDAY,
THAT POSSIBLY THERE WAS
SOMETHING GOING ON
BETWEEN ADORE AND LAGANJA,
BUT I CAN'T REMEMBER,
BUT I'M SORRY.
- NUMBER 1.
- FUCK THESE BITCHES.
ARE YOU IN A WHITESNAKE VIDEO?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING OVER THERE?
- SHE MOUTHED OFF
TO EVERY SINGLE PERSON.
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO YOU ARE.
- I WILL SHOW YOU VERSATILITY
WHEN SANTINO
WINS A SEWING COMPETITION
AND VISAGE
WEARS A FUCKING TURTLENECK.
- AND THEN I LOVE THE FACT
THAT SHE THROWS THE TRUTH
BACK IN THEIR FACE.
- I'M MORE OF A BEYONCE MYSELF.
- AT LEAST BEYONCE'S DRESSES
HIT THE FLOOR.
- NOW, LET'S GET
ONE THING STRAIGHT.
BIANCA'S NOT A BITCH,
SHE'S RIGHT.
- WE'RE DRAG QUEENS
IN A FUCKING COMPETITION.
THE ONLY THING WORSE
IS FUCKING PRISON.
- NOW, LIKE TRUE SISTERS,
MY GIRLS ARE ALWAYS THERE
TO LIFT EACH OTHER UP.
LET'S COUNT DOWN THIS SEASON'S
TOP 3 SUPPORT HO'S.
NUMBER 3.
- WHEN EVERYBODY WAS BAGGING
ON MILK FOR HER LOOK,
JOSLYN WAS THE ONLY ONE
TO STICK UP FOR HER.
- YOU'RE IGNORANT.
I'M SORRY, IT'S IGNORANCE.
- OH, IGNORANT NOW.
- YES.
- OKAY, WELL, IGNORANT
WOULD BE ME NOT WANTING
TO BETTER EDUCATE MYSELF.
- WELL, EDUCATE YOURSELF.
- AND THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING HER
WHAT SHE THINKS.
- NO, YOU'RE READING HER.
- OF COURSE,
WHEN A PERSON'S IGNORANT,
THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT THAT WORD MEANS.
[LAUGHS]
SO SHE GOT ALL BENT
OUT OF SHAPE,
AND IT WAS THE TRUTH.
- I'M NOT EDUCATED?
YOU LOOK
LIKE A FUCKING RECYCLING BIN.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.
- NUMBER 2.
YOU ARE BENDELACREME,
AND THAT'S THE CHARACTER
THAT YOU HAVE BUILT,
AND DON'T YOU CHANGE IT
FOR NOBODY.
- WHEN HER SISTERS
WERE FEELING DOWN
AFTER A ROUGH DAY AT THE OFFICE,
IT WAS NICE TO SEE
THAT TRINITY WAS ABLE
TO GO AROUND AND GIVE THEM
A LITTLE PEP TALK, YOU KNOW?
- DO NOT BEAT YOURSELF UP
OR FEEL BAD
BECAUSE COURTNEY,
YOUR COMPETITOR,
TOLD YOU
THAT YOUR LOOK IS NOT POLISHED.
- SHE WAS GIVING THEM A PEP TALK
LIKE SHE WAS A COACH
IN THE SUPER BOWL OR SOMETHING.
- EXACTLY.
- DID BEYONCE PERFORM
AT THE SUPER BOWL?
SHE WASN'T THE COACH, RIGHT?
[LAUGHS]
- NUMBER 1.
- REMEMBER, TRINITY,
YOU KNOW YOU CAN DO THIS.
YOU GOT THIS, BITCH.
- BIANCA HAS A SOFT SIDE,
AND SHE HELPS THE GIRLS.
- I THINK THAT BIANCA IS
ACTUALLY A REALLY NICE PERSON.
I THINK SHE'S PROBABLY
A VERY SENSITIVE PERSON,
I'M IMAGINING.
- I, AND DON'T TELL ANYBODY
THAT I'M BEING KIND,
BUT I HAVE ANOTHER CINCHER
IF YOU WANT ME
TO LACE YOU IN IT.
- I'M DOWN.
- OKAY, WE'LL DO IT.
- SECRETLY, SHE ALLOWED ADORE
TO BORROW ONE OF HER CORSETS
IN FRONT OF 9 CAMERAS.
WAY TO PLAY THE GAME, BITCH.
- COMING UP, LEGENDARY QUEENS
GIVE NEW INSIGHT INTO THE TOP 3.
- FOR SUCH A VICIOUS BITCH,
SHE SHO IS PURTY.
- CALM DOWN, BEYONCE.
- AND THE PIT CREW
SISSY THAT WALK.
- AY, DIOS MIO.
- AS "RUPAUL'S DRAG RACE:
COUNTDOWN TO THE CROWN"
CONTINUES.
- OKAY?
- [LAUGHS]
WELCOME BACK TO "RUPAUL'S DRAG
RACE: COUNTDOWN TO THE CROWN."
WITH JUST ONE WEEK
UNTIL WE CROWN
AMERICA'S NEXT DRAG SUPERSTAR,
IT'S ANYBODY'S GAME.
- PREGNANT PAUSE,
PREGNANT PAUSE.
- THE TIME HAS COME
TO SCHOOL THE CHILDREN
ON THE ABCs.
LEARN IT, AND LEARN IT WELL.
- FUCK YEAH, I'M THE FIRST ONE!
- A YOUNG QUEEN BURSTING
WITH RAW TALENT,
AND THE ABILITY TO CHARM
HER WAY OUT OF...ANYTHING?
- BUT I HAD TO WEAR IT,
BECAUSE IT WAS SEE-THROUGH,
AND I WANTED TO SHOW MY BODY.
- [LAUGHTER]
- ADORE HAS BABY JESUS EYES.
SHE JUST...
YOU CAN'T HELP BUT LOVE HER.
- I LOVE ADORE DELANO,
BECAUSE SHE'S LIKE,
"MY DRESS DOESN'T HIT THE FLOOR,
AND I LOOK FUCKING COOL."
- YOU KNOW,
I LOVE THAT SHE'S GOT
A LITTLE BIT
OF MESSINESS TO HER.
I THINK A LITTLE BIT OF DIRT
UNDER THE ACRYLIC FINGERNAILS
IS KIND OF HOT SOMETIMES.
- I'M FUCKING HOOD.
I'M FROM AZUSA.
I'LL STAB A BITCH.
[LAUGHS]
- SHE TAKES THE CRITIQUES,
SHE TRIES TO GROW FROM THEM,
BUT SHE'S STILL LOVING IT.
- SHE HAD A BREAKTHROUGH WITH RU
IN THE WALKTHROUGH.
- I CAME HERE TO BE TOP 3,
AND TO FUCKING WIN IT.
- YOU CAN TASTE
THAT SHE REALLY WANTED IT.
- OOH, GIRL, BITCH BROUGHT IT
FOR THE VIDEO SHOOT.
- HER SISSY
WAS SISSYING MY WALK.
SHE WAS GIVING ME SISSY SPACEK.
- SHE'S EAGER, SHE'S READY,
AND SHE SINGS.
- OH, AND IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE.
- OH, SHIT, SHE'S GOING
TO TAKE MY GIGS. I HATE HER.
- PARTY.
- ADORE MAY HAVE STARTED
WITH A WHIMPER,
BUT SHE ENDED WITH A BIG BANG.
WILL THIS FALLEN IDOL CONTINUE
HER RISE TO THE TIPPITY TOP?
- NOT TODAY, SATAN. NOT TODAY.
- BIANCA DEL RIO WAS
THIS SEASON'S MOUTH THAT ROARED.
- THESE PEOPLE
ARE A BUNCH OF ASSHOLES.
- SHE'S A KILLER COMEDIAN,
A SEASONED QUEEN,
AND A DAMN SEAMSTRESS.
LOVE THAT DRESS.
- YOU CAN BORROW IT.
- THAT DRESS IS GORGEOUS.
- YOU CAN BORROW THIS ONE TOO.
I'LL LEND IT TO YOU, GIRL.
- NOT ONLY CAN SHE CUT
A DRESS PATTERN,
BUT SHE CAN CUT YOU TO FILTH.
- OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M NOT YOUR MAMA.
MY NAME IS BIANCA.
- NOTHING GETS PAST BIANCA,
AND I LOVE THAT.
- AND I GOT TO THINKING
THAT IT WAS A CROCK OF SHIT.
- SHE'S THE BITCH
THAT I AGREE WITH.
- SHE KEEPS IT SO REAL,
AND EVERYTHING
THAT COMES OUT OF HER MOUTH
IS JUST ALL BRILLIANCE
ALL THE TIME.
- SHE'S A MAN WITH ONE EYE.
- AT THE BEAT OF HER EYELASH,
SHE COULD DROP
A FREAKING ONE-LINER.
- WHO'S HELPING YOU OUT?
- WELL,
THEY'RE ALL HELPING ME OUT
BY BEING HORRIBLE
AND MAKING ME LOOK BETTER.
- [LAUGHS]
- I WAS PRETTY FLABBERGASTED
HOW SWEET BIANCA HAS TURNED OUT.
SHE'S ACTUALLY HELPED PEOPLE
DO THEIR MAKE-UP,
CINCHED THEIR BODY,
AND REACHED OUT
IN A TIME OF NEED.
- IF YOU EVER NEED ANYTHING,
CALL A HATEFUL BITCH LIKE ME.
- BUT IS SHE REALLY HELPING?
YOU NEVER KNOW.
THIS IS A COMPETITION, GIRLS.
- COME ON, SHAKE IT OFF.
SHAKE IT OFF, SHAKE IT OFF.
PRETEND IT'S GAS.
JUST LEAVE IT IN THE HALLWAY.
- BIANCA DEL RIO
IS A TAKE-NO-PRISONERS
PROFESSIONAL BITCH
WITH A HEART OF GOLD.
- YOU ALWAYS END
WITH A NASTY COMMENT.
- I ALWAYS BEGIN WITH ONE TOO!
- SHE'S A CUTTHROAT CONTENDER
FOR THE CROWN,
BUT SHE'S NOT ALONE.
- IS THIS "AMERICA'S
NEXT TOP MODEL"?
- ENTER COURTNEY ACT.
- I HONESTLY WANT TO JUST SKIN
YOU ALIVE AND WEAR YOUR BODY.
- A PROVEN SINGER AND SUPERSTAR
FROM THE LAND DOWN UNDER,
COURTNEY ACT CAUGHT
OUR ATTENTION FROM DAY ONE.
- [SQUAWKS]
- [LAUGHS]
- OH, IF PRETTY HURTS,
COURTNEY IS MURDERING US.
- EVERY TIME SHE WALKS DOWN
THE RUNWAY, I'M LIKE,
"WHO LET THAT GIRL IN HERE?
CAN SOMEONE CALL SECURITY?
"THERE'S A YOUNG WOMAN
WALKING AROUND
THE MAIN STAGE."
- SUCH A SHAME ABOUT THAT BODY.
I KNOW SHE WISHES SHE HAD
MY CURVES AND SWERVES, BABY.
- THE ONLY THING WRONG
I WOULD SAY IS, YOU'RE PERFECT.
- WELL, EVERYONE ELSE
IS RELYING ON UGLY.
WHY CAN'T I RELY ON PRETTY?
- [LAUGHTER]
- SHE IS BEAUTIFUL AND TALENTED.
- I HATE THAT.
- JUST WHEN YOU'RE READY
TO HATE COURTNEY,
SHE DOES SOMETHING NICE.
YOU SHADY LITTLE BITCH.
- YOU CAN FIND YOURSELF
A NICE MAN
LOOKING JUST LIKE THAT.
- YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU'RE RIGHT.
- I JUST FEEL LIKE I HAVE
A WEIRDLY PROPORTIONED BODY.
- WELL, MAYBE YOU DO,
AND SO WHAT?
- COURTNEY HAS STAR QUALITY
WRITTEN ALL OVER HER.
- WOULDN'T IT BE SO EXCITING
TO HAVE AN AUSTRALIAN
AMERICA'S NEXT DRAG SUPERSTAR?
- WILL THIS AUSSIE IMPORT
PULL AHEAD
AND LEAVE THESE DOMESTIC MODELS
IN HER DUST?
- COURTNEY DEFINITELY
HAS WHAT IT TAKES
TO BE AMERICA'S NEXT DRAG
SUPERSTAR, BUT I--
- BIANCA SHOULD WIN.
- I LIKE ADORE DELANO,
BECAUSE SHE'S 22, AND SHE'S--
- SILENCE.
I HAVE NOT MADE MY DECISION.
SO WHOSE TEAM
ARE YOU PLAYING FOR?
TEAM ADORE DELANO,
TEAM BIANCA DEL RIO,
OR TEAM COURTNEY ACT?
HASHTAG IT AND TELL THE WORLD
WHO YOU THINK SHOULD BE CROWNED
AMERICA'S NEXT DRAG SUPERSTAR.
- COULD WE JUST
CROWN THIS BITCH ALREADY?
- UP NEXT,
MY GIRLS GO BLINDLY
WHERE NO QUEENS
HAVE GONE BEFORE.
- OKAY.
- PLUS, THE WORLD VIDEO PREMIERE
OF "SISSY THAT WALK"
WHEN "RUPAUL'S DRAG RACE:
COUNTDOWN TO THE CROWN"
CONTINUES.
[LAUGHS]
WELCOME BACK TO "RUPAUL'S DRAG
RACE: COUNTDOWN TO THE CROWN."
ADORE DELANO, BIANCA DEL RIO,
COURTNEY ACT,
WHO DO YOU THINK
HAS THE BIGGEST CHARISMA,
UNIQUENESS, NERVE, AND TALENT?
STARTING NOW,
YOU'VE GOT ONE WEEK
TO LET ME AND THE WORLD KNOW.
RIGHT, GIRLS?
- YES, GOD.
- ABSOLUTELY.
- DON'T WEAR BACON.
- THIS SEASON,
I'VE BEEN CRITICIZED
FOR PROMOTING
TOO MANY OF MY PRODUCTS,
SO, TONIGHT
I WILL NOT BE PLUGGING
MY NUMBER ONE ALBUM
"BORN NAKED."
I WILL MAKE NO MENTION
OF MY SIGNATURE FRAGRANCE
RUPAUL'S GLAMAZON.
AND MY FINAL VOW, YOU WILL NOT
HEAR A PEEP OUT OF ME
ABOUT THE NEW RUPAUL CANDY BAR.
NOT A PEEP. I WON'T MENTION IT,
EVEN THOUGH IT IS MADE
WITH DELICIOUS MILK CHOCOLATE,
SEA SALT, AND...
- OH!
- ALL RIGHT.
- OH, MY GOD.
- [LAUGHS]
THAT SHIT IS GOOD.
AND NOW, THE WORLD PREMIERE
OF THE OFFICIAL VIDEO
FOR "SISSY THAT WALK."
AND NEXT WEEK,
JOIN ME AND ALL MY GIRLS
FOR
"RUPAUL'S DRAG RACE REUNITED."
- OKAY.
- NOW, REMEMBER,
IF YOU CAN'T LOVE YOURSELF,
HOW IN THE HELL
YOU GON' LOVE SOMEBODY ELSE?
CAN I GET A CHOCOLATE BAR
UP IN HERE?
- AMEN.
- HALLELOO.
- AMEN.
- LET THE MUSIC VIDEO PLAY.
- COME ON, NATCH.


- PREVIOUSLY
ON "RU PAUL'S DRAG RACE..."
THE HOUSE OF RU PAUL
IS THROWING THE FIRST-EVER
GLITTER BALL!
- I JUST GET REALLY,
LIKE, DISCOURAGED
AND, LIKE, FRUSTRATED.
- WHY IS IT YOU HAVEN'T
WON MORE CHALLENGES?
- NOW I'M STARTING
ALL OVER.
I'M FUCKED.
- I DON'T BELIEVE THAT YOU'RE
GONNA RUN ANY BUSINESS
DRESSED LIKE THAT.
IT WAS A COCKTAIL DRESS.
- ADORE DELANO...
CONDRAGULATIONS.
YOU'RE THE WINNER
OF THIS WEEK'S CHALLENGE.
- OH, MY GOD.
DARIENNE LAKE,
SHANTE, YOU STAY.
DE LA, SASHAY AWAY.
[LOUD SIGH]
- OH, MY GOD. OOH.
- WHAT THE FUCK
IS THAT ON THE MIRROR?
- JESUS! DARIENNE
IS SPELLED INCORRECTLY.
BUT THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
- "I ONLY HARBOR
ENOUGH RESENTMENT
"TO WRITE A LONG,
POINTLESS MESSAGE
THAT YOU'LL HAVE TO CLEAN
AND CLEAN AND CLEAN AND CLEAN."
- I'M DEFINITELY
GONNA MISS DE LA.
[MUMBLES]
NO, I WON'T. I WON'T.
- WELL, CONGRATULATIONS,
MISS ADORE.
- YOU WON
A SEWING CHALLENGE.
- YEAH, MOTHERFUCKER, YEAH.
- ARE THEY SEEING
WHAT I'M SEEING?
SHE WAS JUST WEARING
A WHITE TUTU
WITH A CORSET
AND SOME SPARKLES ON IT.
- YOU DID GREAT.
- WELL, APPARENTLY ADORE
IS THE PERFECT BANJEE GIRL.
- TONIGHT, COURTNEY KIND OF
THREW ME UNDER THE MAT.
- OVER THE LAST
FEW WEEKS,
ADORE KIND OF TRIPPED
AND STUMBLED.
SO I THINK THAT SHE WOULD BE
THE NEXT ONE TO GO.
- I REALLY
DON'T SEE THE POINT
WHY COURTNEY THREW
MY NAME OUT THERE.
THE QUESTION WAS WHO DO YOU
THINK SHOULD GO HOME,
NOT WHO YOU THOUGHT
WAS GOING TO
BUT IT TURNED IT
THE FUCK OUT.
- YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
THE JUDGES ARE GONNA THINK.
- NO, YOU REALLY
DON'T KNOW.
THEY WANT MORE,
BUT THEN THEY WANT--
MY RUFFLE'S TOO BIG,
AND MY HAT'S TOO MUCH.
I DON'T KNOW.
- IF I AM BRUTALLY HONEST...
- SURE.
BE BRUTALLY HONEST.
- I KIND OF WAS THINKING
THAT YOU WOULD TURN OUT
SOMETHING THAT WE HADN'T SEEN.
- NOT TODAY, SATAN.
NOT TODAY.
HEY, I'M STILL HERE.
I'M GRATEFUL.
- BIANCA IS
A LITTLE RATTLED.
MAYBE I'M STARTING TO SEE
A COUPLE OF CRACKS IN THE WALL.
I HOPE SO.
- PARTY.
[THEME MUSIC PLAYING]
- THE WINNER
OF "RU PAUL'S DRAG RACE"
RECEIVES A SICKENING SUPPLY
OF COLOREVOLUTION COSMETICS
AND A CASH PRIZE
OF $100,000.
- FOUR!
- HOW COOL!
- I'M SO EXCITED
TO BE IN THE TOP FOUR.
I'M SO CLOSE
TO THE FINISH LINE,
AND YOU COULD GRAB IT,
OR IT COULD JUST SLIP AWAY.
SO I'M GONNA GRAB IT.
- IT'S BEEN
A LONG JOURNEY.
- I THINK--
[SIREN]
- YAY! RIGHT WHEN
COURTNEY IS TALKING.
- OOH, GIRL!
MY TOP FOUR,
YOU'VE ALL COME SO FAR,
AND THE ONLY THING STANDING
BETWEEN YOU AND THE CROWN
IS YOU.
SO SHOULDERS BACK,
TITS OUT,
AND GIRL, YOU'D BETTER
SISSY THAT WALK.
- YES!
- HELLO, HELLO, HELLO!
IT'S ME, BEN DE LA CREME.
I'M BACK.
YOU MADE IT
TO THE TOP FOUR!
CONDRAGULATIONS!
FOR YOUR FINAL CHALLENGE,
YOU'LL BE STARRING
IN THE MUSIC VIDEO
"SISSY THAT WALK."
[CHEERING]
IT'S A TIMELESS TALE
OF AN INNOCENT GIRL
WHO SELLS HER SOUL
TO BECOME SISSY,
INTERNATIONAL SUPERMODEL
OF THE WORLD!
- I LOVE IT.
- YOU'LL LEARN
SISSY-OGRAPHY
WITH WORLD-RENOWNED
CHOREOGRAPHER JAMAL SIMS.
YOU'LL ALSO BE STARRING
IN TWO ACTING SCENES,
WHERE YOU'LL BE IMPROVISING
WITH RU PAUL.
OH, AND I HOPE YOU'RE HUNGRY,
BECAUSE YOU'RE EACH INVITED
TO A LITTLE MOTHER-DAUGHTER
LUNCH WITH MAMA RU.
- AW...
- AND IN THE END, ONE OF YOU
WILL BE ELIMINATED.
- OH, BOY.
- UH...GAME CHANGER.
- WE ALL THOUGHT
NO ONE ELSE IS GOING HOME,
LIKE IN PAST SEASONS,
SO...YEAH, IT'S VERY THAT.
- SO DON'T FUCK IT UP.
- THIS IS IT. WE HAVE TO
DELIVER, OR WE GO HOME.
- GENTLEMEN,
START YOUR ENGINES.
AND MAY THE BEST
WOMAN WIN.
- LADIES...
- HI!
- HOW ARE YOU DOING?
- UH, HOW ARE YOU DOING?
- YOU GUYS READY TO LEARN
SOME SISSY-OGRAPHY?
- YEAH.
- I THINK SO.
- COME WITH ME.
SISSY-OGRAPHY IS ABOUT NOT BEING
AFRAID TO BE SEXY AND HOT
AND FUN AND SASSY.
I'M LOOKING FOR THEM
TO GIVE IT.
JUST WATCH ME.
1, 2, AND 3, 4.
WALK BACK, BAH,
HOO, CLICK.
- WELL, THAT'S EASY.
- ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.
- ADORE, LET'S GO.
GO. 1, 2, 3, AND 4.
5, 6, WHAT, 7, 8.
COURTNEY.
1, 2, 3, AND 4,
5, 6, 7, 8. GOOD.
BIANCA, HERE WE GO.
- JUST TO LET YOU KNOW,
I HAD A STROKE IN 1972.
- YOU GOT THIS. YOU GOT THIS.
COME ON WITH IT.
5, 6, 7, 8. GO.
- SHIT. I CAN'T.
AM I GOING DOWN, OR AM I--
- YOU'RE GOING--LOOK.
YOU'RE GONNA START
WITH YOUR CHEST, AND THEN THAT
ROLLS DOWN YOUR BODY.
LET IT...LET IT DIP.
YOU SEE THAT? THERE YOU ARE.
- YEAH? THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
- JUST KEEP GOING.
- BUT LOOK, YOU CAN'T BE
SMILING LIKE THIS.
- YOU LIKE THIS?
YOU LIKE MY ROLL?
- BIANCA IS STRUGGLING
BECAUSE
SHE'S MORE WORRIED
ABOUT BEING FUNNY
TO DEFLECT THE FACT
THAT SHE'S NOT BEING GOOD.
- HA HA HA!
- MISS DARIENNE, READY?
- YEAH.
- LET'S GO SLOW.
- YEAH.
- SO 5, 6, 7.
LET'S GO.
GO. 1 AND 2, 3, 4.
- [INDISTINCT]
- I SEE YOU THINKING.
WE HAVE TO LET THAT GO.
NOW ALL TOGETHER.
5, 6, 7, 8.
AND 1, 2, 3, AND 4,
5, 6, 7, 8.
1, 2, AND 3, 4,
5, 6, AND 7, 8.
WHAT HAPPENED?
- I DON'T KNOW. I JUST...
I GOT LOST ON THE FIRST ONE,
AND I WAS LIKE,
"OH, BOY."
- YOU'RE DEFEATING YOURSELF
BEFORE WE EVEN START.
YOU COULD DO THIS.
- OH, BOY.
- THIS IS RU'S VIDEO,
SO WE CANNOT FUCK IT UP.
- COURTNEY ACT,
GET YOUR ASS IN HERE.
- HOW ARE YOU?
- I JUST DIDN'T FEEL
LIKE COOKING, SO I ORDERED IN.
- HA HA HA.
- SO, $100,000,
AMERICA'S NEXT DRAG SUPERSTAR.
WHY SHOULD YOU
GET THE CROWN?
- I CAN LOOK GOOD, I CAN
SING GOOD, I CAN DANCE GOOD.
IF THERE'S SOMEBODY ELSE
WHO'S BETTER THAN ME,
THEN THEY SHOULD WIN,
BUT I TRULY FEEL
THAT I HAVE BEEN
MY BEST,
AND I FEEL THAT I HAVE BEEN
THE BEST AS WELL.
- YOU'VE BEEN CRITICIZED
FOR RESTING ON PRETTY
AND BEING DIPLOMATIC IN A WAY
THAT FELT SORT OF CANNED.
WHAT ABOUT THE EMOTIONAL,
VULNERABLE SIDE
OF COURTNEY ACT?
- I KNOW. IT CONCERNS ME
THAT IT SEEMS CANNED
BECAUSE I TRULY FEEL
LIKE I COME FROM
THIS PLACE OF OBJECTIVITY,
AND I FEEL LIKE,
IN THE COMPETITION AS WELL,
I'M IN, LIKE, WORK MODE,
AND I'M FOCUSED
ON WORK.
- WE CAN ALL STAND FOR
A LITTLE BIT MORE HUMANITY,
EVEN IF THAT HUMANITY
SEEMS MESSY AND UNCOMFORTABLE.
I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE
THAT VULNERABILITY.
I CAN SEE IT IN YOUR EYES,
AND I'M VERY PROUD OF YOU.
GIVE 'EM HELL
OUT THERE.
- I WILL. THANK YOU.
- SO, WHAT ARE YOU, LIKE, MOST
WORRIED ABOUT IN THIS CHALLENGE?
- I DON'T SEE
THE FUNCTION OF WORRY.
I THINK IT'S ALL
REALLY FUN.
- BUT, I MEAN,
IT'S TOP FOUR, BITCH.
LIKE, ANY TYPE OF, LIKE,
THING CAN HAPPEN
THAT CAN, LIKE,
SEND US HOME.
- WELL, YOU KNOW, RU SAID
THAT SOMETIMES WHEN I TALK,
MY ANSWERS
CAN SOUND CANNED,
WHICH KIND OF CAME
AS A SHOCK,
BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE
EVERYTHING I SAY
KIND OF COMES
FROM THE HEART.
AND I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW
ENTIRELY WHAT SHE MEANS.
SO I CAN'T REALLY--
I'M NOT GONNA BLOW MY HEAD UP
THINKING ABOUT IT.
I FEEL GOOD.
I FEEL EXCITED.
I'M HAPPY.
I'M DOING A WIG.
- IF YOU THINK FOR A MINUTE
THAT IT'S JUST A CAKEWALK...
LOOK WHAT HAPPENED TO ME
THE LAST CHALLENGE.
I SEW, AND THIS BITCH
TAKES THE CAKE.
ALL OF US
SHOULD BE NERVOUS.
SOMEBODY'S GOING HOME,
AND WITH THAT CONFIDENCE,
IT MIGHT BE HER.
- COMING UP...
- SHE NEEDS TO IMPRESS
THE JUDGES,
AND I DON'T KNOW
IF SHE CAN.
[RU PAUL LAUGHING]
- WHY, DARIENNE LAKE.
- HI, RU. HELLO, GORGEOUS.
- GET YOUR TUSH
IN HERE, DOLL.
SO, DARIENNE, YOU'RE
GOING TO BE FAMOUS.
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DEAL WITH
PEOPLE SAYING THINGS,
MOSTLY...B.S.?
- YOU KNOW, I CAN BRUSH OFF
WHAT PEOPLE SAY TO ME
BECAUSE GROWING UP,
I'VE HEARD HORRIBLE THINGS.
- YOU WERE THROWN OUT OF
THE HOUSE AS A KID, WEREN'T YOU?
- IT WASN'T "PACK
YOUR BAGS AND LEAVE."
IT WAS MORE LIKE
AN INVITATION TO LEAVE.
MY MOTHER SAID, "YOU HAVE A LOT
OF NERVE TO STAND THERE
"IN MY HOUSE ON MY DIME
AND LIVE YOUR LIFESTYLE
THAT I DON'T APPROVE OF."
AND SHE'S LIKE,
"YOU'RE A CLOWN.
PEOPLE ARE GONNA
LAUGH AT YOU."
AND I THINK SHE STILL HAS
THAT WHOLE THING
THAT QUEERS ARE BELOW
ANY OTHER PERSON.
THERE WAS A LOT OF YEARS
OF NOT LOVING MYSELF.
- LOVING YOURSELF--IT REALLY
TAKES A DAILY PRACTICE.
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU.
- THERE ARE THINGS
I'M GETTING FROM RU
THAT I DON'T GET
FROM MY OWN MOTHER.
THIS EXPERIENCE HAS REALLY
ENRICHED THE LOVE OF MYSELF.
- ALL RIGHT, SWEETHEART.
NOW GET YOUR ASS
BACK TO WORK.
YOU'VE GOT
A CROWN TO WIN.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
- I'M TRYING TO DECIDE,
FOR THE FINAL RUNWAY LOOK,
BETWEEN, LIKE, THIS
OR TO GO FOR SOMETHING
WITH A BIT MORE PIZZAZZ.
THIS IS THE FINAL TIME I'M GONNA
BE WALKING DOWN THE RUNWAY.
SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE
THAT I'M GLITTERY AND FABULOUS.
THIS IS, LIKE,
A FEATHER BACKPACK
THAT'S GOT, LIKE, BIG PHEASANT
FEATHERS COMING OUT THE BACK.
THAT'S CUTE.
- I HAVE A HOODED THING
AS WELL.
- AH...
THAT'S PRETTY.
- MAYBE THIS IS
MY OPPORTUNITY
TO WEAR MY PRISCILLA WIG.
IT'S A LITTLE HOMAGE TO
PRISCILLA, QUEEN OF THE DESERT.
- I MAY NOT HAVE, LIKE,
EXPENSIVE-ASS GOWNS
OR ACCESSORIES
TO THE MAX,
BUT YOU DON'T NEED ALL OF THAT
TO BE A FUCKIN' STAR.
LIKE, YOU CAN WEAR
A PAPER BAG,
AND YOU CAN SEE
OUT OF THE CROWD
WHO IS GONNA BE SOMETHING
OR WHO IS SOMETHING ALREADY.
- DO YOU KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE GONNA WEAR YET?
- I'LL WEAR
SOMETHING CUTE.
- ADORE REMINDS ME
OF ME 10 YEARS AGO.
THERE WAS, LIKE,
A SPARK AND A TALENT THERE,
BUT THERE WASN'T
THE REFINEMENT.
SHE NEEDS TO IMPRESS THE JUDGES,
AND I DON'T KNOW IF SHE CAN.
- IT'S JUST $10 ON eBAY.
- HELLO.
- HELLO.
- COME ON IN.
- I FEEL LIKE I'M
AT THE LAST SUPPER.
- WELL, HERE YOU ARE,
TOP FOUR.
- I KNOW.
- YOU'RE VERY ASTUTE.
YOU'RE ONE OF THE BETTER PLAYERS
WE'VE HAD COME THROUGH HERE.
WHERE'S THAT COME FROM?
- I'VE HAD SOME AMAZING
PEOPLE IN MY LIFE
THAT HAVE TAUGHT ME
THAT, YOU KNOW,
THAT WERE LIKE, "QUEEN,
YOU DON'T NEED TO WEAR THAT WIG,
YOU DON'T NEED TO SAY THAT,"
AND NOW I CATCH MYSELF
ON COUNTLESS OCCASIONS
SAYING THINGS TO OTHER QUEENS,
AND I'M LIKE, "I SOUND
LIKE THE OLD ONE NOW, YOU KNOW."
- NOW THE REST OF THE WORLD
WILL SEE THAT NICER SIDE.
ARE YOU PREPARED
FOR THAT?
- YOU'VE BEEN FILMING THIS?
THERE'S TAPE
IN THOSE CAMERAS?
- YEAH.
- OH, GREAT!
- COMING INTO
THIS COMPETITION,
I HAD NO INTENTIONS
OF MENTORING ANY CHILD.
BUT IT'S BEEN
KIND OF REFRESHING
IN A WEIRD,
FUCKED-UP WAY.
- SO, ADORE, WHY SHOULD YOU
GET THE CROWN?
- THIS IS MY PASSION.
IT'S MY CALLING.
I WAS RAISED RIGHT,
SO I WOULD NOT LET YOU DOWN.
- SO, ADORE, YOU'RE
REALLY CLOSE TO YOUR MOM.
- YOU TALK ABOUT HER
ALL THE TIME.
- YEAH. LIKE, MY MOM
IS ALL I NEED.
SHE'S LIKE MY MOM, MY DAD,
MY GRANDPARENTS,
SHE'S EVERYTHING TO ME, SO...
- WHAT ABOUT YOUR DAD?
- I DON'T REALLY HAVE
A RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM.
- DO YOU WANT ONE?
WHY NOT?
- THERE'S A LOT
OF THINGS
THAT HE SAID TO ME
WHEN I WAS YOUNGER.
WHEN I WAS 7,
HE SAID THAT, LIKE,
HE WAS BASICALLY
EMBARRASSED OF ME
BECAUSE I WAS FEMININE
AND I LIKED GIRL THINGS.
AND IT JUST REALLY
STUCK WITH ME.
THAT, I THINK, HAS A LOT
TO DO WITH MY CONFIDENCE.
LIKE, A LOT
OF MY FREAK-OUTS,
A LOT OF MY INSECURITIES
COME FROM THAT.
- A BONE, IN THE PLACE
IT WAS BROKEN,
AFTER IT HEALS, THAT BECOMES
THE STRONGEST PLACE ON THE BONE.
YOU KNOW
WHAT I'M SAYING?
SO THAT BROKEN
PLACE IN YOU
CAN BE YOUR SPIRITUAL
RESURRECTION,
BECAUSE YOU'RE
A FABULOUS KID
AND YOU'VE GOT
LOTS OF TALENT.
AND HE'S REALLY
MISSING OUT.
WHAT'S YOUR MOM'S NAME?
- BONNIE.
DO THIS FOR BONNIE.
SHE'S THE ONE ROOTING
FOR YOU BACK HOME.
AND YOU GO OUT THERE,
AND YOU DON'T LET THE SABOTEUR
GET YOU OFF THE TRACK.
- NOW IT'S TIME TO SHOOT
OUR DANCE ROUTINE
FOR "SISSY THAT WALK"
BY RU PAUL.
- LADIES, I REALLY WANT YOU
TO LOOK LIKE A PERFORMANCE,
NOT A REHEARSAL.
OK? CUE THE MUSIC.
- NOW SISSY THAT WALK.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
- COME ON!
HEY!
CUT. CUT.
ADORE, DARIENNE,
YOU HAVE TO BE IN SYNC
FOR IT TO LOOK RIGHT.
THAT WAS NOT $100,000
CHOREOGRAPHY RIGHT THERE.
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET THE SCRUFF
PIT CREW WITH THE FANS.
ALL RIGHT. TIME TO PUT
THAT SISSY-OGRAPHY
ON THE TREADMILL.
BIANCA DEL RIO.
- ME? OK.
- BREAK A LEG.
- SHUT UP.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
- SPREAD THOSE WINGS.
MAKE IT HOT.
- IT'S WEIRD TO BE
ON A TREADMILL WITH HEELS.
NOW YOU ADD A FAN.
I'M HAVING HURRICANE
KATRINA FLASHBACKS.
SHIT.
JUST MAKE IT,
MAKE IT HOT.
- COURTNEY IS GETTING CRAZY
UP ON THAT DANCE FLOOR.
MOLLY, YOU
IN DANGER, GIRL.
- [SIGHS]
- SHE'S GOT A LITTLE SWAG.
COME ON!
HEY!
YOU'RE ON FIRE
RIGHT NOW. GOOD JOB.
GIVE ME SEXY!
- BITCH JUST STOLE
MY MOTHERFUCKING MOVE!
DO YOU SEE THAT?
BITCH, I DID THAT FIRST.
I DID THAT FIRST.
- COMING UP...

- TWERK IT. TWERK IT.
YOU CALL THAT TWERKING?
KEEP TWERKING!
- GRR! I HATE YOU!
[RU PAUL LAUGHING]
- SO IT'S TIME TO DO
OUR FIRST ACTING SCENE.
IT'S VERY IMPROVY,
AND I REALLY WANT TO SHOW RU
THAT I'M READY
TO FUCKING SLAY THIS.
- WELCOME, ADORE.
IT'S TIME FOR YOUR SCENE--
A SMALL-TOWN GIRL
COMES TO THE BIG CITY.
SO YOU'VE GOT TO SELL

AS THIS KIND OF GREEN GIRL.
AND ACTION.

YOUR SCENE, BIANCA.

- SPANK YOURSELF, BABY.
YEAH. HARDER.
HARDER. HARDER.
- THAT'S IT!
I HAVE NOTHING LEFT!

YOU'RE A LOSER.
- I HATE YOU!
I HATE YOU!
IT BEARS REPEATING--
I HATE YOU!
AAH!

PUSHING ME TOO FAR!
- THAT'S BECAUSE
YOU ARE A LOSER.
- I HATE YOU!
- I HATE YOU MORE.
- I HATE YOU!
I HATE YOU!
- JUST A LITTLE HYSTERIA
AND WE'RE OUT.
- AAH!
- AND CUT.
COURTNEY, SO...ACTION.
SO, KID, POSE.
NOW SEXY.
NOW YOU'RE SUPER SEXY.
NOW YOU'RE BACK
TO JUST BASIC SEXY.
NOW BE A SEXY DOG.
BARK LIKE A DOG.
- [BARKING]
- NOW YOU'RE SNOOP DOG.
YOU'RE SNOOP DOG.
NOW YOU'RE A CORN DOG.
NOW YOU'RE A HOT DOG.
WITH YOUR HORN DOG.
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT
A HORN DOG IS, MR. DIRECTOR.
- NOW TWERK IT.
TWERK IT.
YOU CALL THAT TWERKING?
- I JUST CAN'T DO IT ANYMORE!
STOP IT!
YOU'VE PUSHED ME
TOO FAR!
- YOU'RE A LOSER.
- YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO
SLAP HIM, COURT.
- OH.
UH!
- IS THAT ALL YOU GOT?
OH, THAT TICKLED.
WAKE ME
WHEN YOU'RE DONE.
- THERE WAS JUST MEANT
TO BE THREE SLAPS,
BUT PERHAPS I DID GO
FOR ABOUT 25.
KNOCK IT...HA HA HA!
- OH!
- AND WE'RE OUT.
THANK YOU, COURTNEY.
GO CHANGE AND GET READY FOR
YOUR SECOND ACTING CHALLENGE.
- HELLO.
- HELLO.
- NOW IT'S TIME FOR US TO SHOOT
OUR SECOND SCENE WITH RU.
- I'M YOUR SCENE
PARTNER--CHARLES.
- NICE TO MEET YOU,
CHARLES.
VERY NICE TO SEE YOU.
YOU'RE KILLING ME RIGHT NOW.
HA HA HA!
AND THERE HE IS.
RU PAUL IS NOW DRESSED UP
LIKE AN EXTRA FROM "GOOD TIMES."
- UH, REMEMBERING THIS WAS
A MAN YOU ONCE LOVED,
AND REALLY
GET THE AUDIENCE
TO FEEL THE HYSTERIA
OF A WOMAN ON THE VERGE.
- OK.
- ACTION.
- I CAME ALL THE WAY
FROM NEW ORLEANS
TO BRING YOU HOME.
- DON'T YOU KNOW
WHO I AM?
I AM SISSY! SISSY!
S-I...
ALL RIGHT, MAYBE I DON'T
KNOW HOW TO SPELL,
BUT I DON'T
PLAY SCRABBLE.
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHY?
I AM SUPERMODEL
OF THE WORLD!
- AND CUT.
IT WAS GOOD,
BUT YOU COULD CONNECT
A LITTLE MORE WITH CHARLES.
- OK.
- OKEY-DOKEY. ACTION!
- IF YOU CAN'T
LOVE YOURSELF, GIRL,
HOW IN THE HELL YOU GONNA
LOVE SOMEBODY ELSE, HUH?
- OH, NOW YOU'RE
WRITING POETRY?
HAVE A DRINK ON ME,
YOU BASTARD!
[CRASH]
- AND CUT.
IT WAS ALL RIGHT.
- HA HA HA!
- OK. ADORE.
AND ACTION.
- ADORE, I CAME ALL
THE WAY FROM AZUSA
TO BRING YOU HOME,
WHERE YOU BELONG.
- BELONG?
I DON'T BELONG
TO ANYBODY IN AZUSA.
I BELONG IN THE HEARTS
OF MY FANS.
THE BOYS LOVE SISSY.
THE LADIES LOVE SISSY.
EVERYBODY LOVES ME!
- GOOD-BYE.
- I'M SISSY, DAMN IT!
SUPERMODEL OF THE WORLD.
- CUT. ADORE,
THE INTENSITY IS NICE.
BUT IT'S A PARODY.
PUT SOME MORE TICS
INTO IT.
- OK.
- OH, DARLING,
LOOK AT YOU.
YOU'VE GOT
YOUR METHOD ON.
- THIS IS THE PERFECT
OPPORTUNITY
TO LET MY HAIR DOWN
AND BE MESSY
AND BE SILLY,
AND I DON'T NEED TO BE THAT SORT
OF PERFECT POLISHED COURTNEY.
- ACTION.
- I'VE COME ALL THE WAY
FROM SYDNEY TO BRING YOU HOME.
- I BELONG RIGHT HERE.
I DON'T EVEN SOUND
AUSTRALIAN ANYMORE.
EVERYBODY LOVES ME HERE.
THE WHOLE WORLD
LOVES SISSY!
- YOU DO BIG REALLY WELL.
COULD YOU JUST BRING
THE LITTLE BIT
OF VULNERABILITY
OR LOSS INTO IT?
- I SEE NOW
THAT COURTNEY'S DEAD.
SO GOOD-BYE FOREVER.
NIGHT!
- I'M THE SUPERMODEL
OF THE WORLD!
- CUT. THAT WAS GREAT.
PICTURE UP. ACTION.
- THIS IS WHERE I BELONG.
THIS IS MY HOME--
ON THE STAGE, ON THE COVERS
OF THE MAGAZINES.
- CUT. THIS IS
A MAN THAT YOU LOVED.
I DIDN'T FEEL
YOUR CONFLICT.
LET'S TRY THAT AGAIN.
- SO GOOD-BYE FOREVER.
- CHARLES!
[SOBBING]
DON'T GO!
- SISSY. LOOK WHAT THEY'VE
DONE TO YOU, SISSY.
COME BACK.
- WOULD YOU STILL
HAVE ME?
- COME TO ME.
COME ON, MAMA.
- AND...CUT!
WOW. THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL,
UNEXPECTED, AND AMAZING.
GUESS WHAT.
THAT'S A WRAP.
- THAT WAS FUN.
- COMING UP...
- THE SECOND ACTING CHALLENGE
WAS KIND OF LIKE THIS.
THAT'S NOT STRONG
ENOUGH FOR ME.
[RU PAUL LAUGHING]
- THIS IS THE LAST DAY,
AND WE ALL HAVE OUR BOW
AND ARROW SET FOR THE TOP THREE.
GODDAMN. THIS IS IT.
- I REMEMBER
ON THE FIRST DAY MEETING ADORE,
AND I WAS LIKE,
"OH, I DON'T LIKE HER."
- WOW.
- I WAS LIKE, "I'M THE IDOL
DRAG QUEEN, NOT YOU."
- I KIND OF GOT THAT ENERGY
FROM YOU IN THE BEGINNING.
- BUT THEN IT WAS LIKE,
"ACTUALLY, I REALLY LIKE HER."
- YEAH.
I'M FUCKING COOL.
- LIKE, FOR MY FIRST
IMPRESSION OF EVERYBODY,
I KIND OF KNEW
WHO COURTNEY ACT WAS.
- KIND OF?
- OH, I'M SORRY, BUT I KNOW
A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE LIKE,
"OH, SHE'S PRETTY. SHE'S
PROBABLY A BITCH IN REAL LIFE."
YOU KNOW,
THAT KIND OF THING.
MY FIRST IMPRESSION
OF COURTNEY--
BEAUTIFUL, KIND OF TALENTED,
POLISHED.
AND NOW SHE'S LIKE A TRUE
SOUL SISTER TO ME,
EVEN THOUGH SHE'S
A ROBOT SOMETIMES.
YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT, "SHE SEEMS
SWEET. SHE SEEMS NICE."
- WHEN I FIRST MET YOU,
I WAS AFRAID OF YOU
BECAUSE YOU ARE
VERY QUICK-WITTED,
AND I KNEW THAT YOU COULD
SHUT ME DOWN IN SECONDS.
IT'S REALLY SURPRISING
THAT BIANCA AND I GET ALONG
BECAUSE AT FIRST SHE REMINDED ME
OF THE GIRLS BACK HOME
THAT REALLY DON'T LIKE ME.
I THOUGHT
WE WERE GONNA FIGHT.
BUT WHEN I GOT TO KNOW YOU,
THE DYNAMIC CHANGED SO MUCH.
I FEEL LIKE YOU BROUGHT
ANOTHER SIDE OUT OF ME.
- NOW, ADORE, THE FIRST DAY
THAT I MET YOU,
YOU WERE STANDING
NEXT TO LAGANJA,
AND I WAS LIKE,
"OH, FUCK."
BUT IT CLICKED,
AND I WAS LIKE,
"OH, SHE'S FUN,
SHE'S COOL,"
BECAUSE YOU HAD SAID
SOMETHING ABOUT HOG BODY,
AND I'M LIKE, "I'VE GOT
THIS EXTRA CORSET.
LET ME HELP
THIS BITCH OUT."
WHAT I LIKE MOST
ABOUT ADORE
IS THAT SHE'S FEARLESS
AND SHE'S FUN.
AND SOMETIMES THAT'S NOT REALLY
A PART OF MY WORLD.
HAD YOU BEEN LAGANJA, YOU'D HAVE
BEEN FAT THE WHOLE TIME.
I WOULDN'T HAVE
GIVEN IT TO HER.
- I WANT BIANCA TO FINISH
A SENTENCE WITHOUT A JOKE.
- OK. COURTNEY
IS AN ASSHOLE. HA HA HA!
- I FEEL LIKE THERE'S
AN UNCOMFORTABILITY
WITH ACTUALLY LETTING PEOPLE
KNOW THAT YOU'RE NICE.
- I THINK THAT PEOPLE ALL
THE TIME SPEND TOO MUCH ENERGY
GOING "I LOVE YOU,"
AND THAT'S JUST WEIRD.
SO I'D RATHER GO, "I LOVE YOU,
BUT YOUR WIG IS HORRIBLE."
THAT'S JUST
MY APPROACH.
- BIANCA IS
A FORMIDABLE TALENT,
BUT AMERICA'S NEXT DRAG
SUPERSTAR NEEDS TO HAVE
A COMPASSION
AND A WARMTH,
AND I DON'T EXPERIENCE
THAT IN HER.
- THE SCARY PART
ABOUT THIS WHOLE THING
IS THAT WE'VE COME
ALL THIS WAY,
AND THERE'S A HUGE CHANCE
THAT YOU DON'T MAKE IT.
IT'S THAT MOMENT
OF, LIKE, "SHIT!"
- YEAH, IT'S LIKE,
"OH, I FINALLY GOT TO HAWAII,
AND THEN I FELL
IN A VOLCANO."
FINAL RUNWAY,
FINAL CRITIQUES--
THIS IS IT.
THIS IS THE FINAL GAME
IN THE WORLD SERIES
OF DRAG.
[RU PAUL LAUGHING]
AND WHAT?
WELCOME TO THE MAIN STAGE
OF "RU PAUL'S DRAG RACE."
TONIGHT IT'S JUST FAMILY,
MY COUNTRY COUSINS
MICHELLE VISAGE...
- LOOKS LIKE WE'VE COME
TO THE END OF THE ROAD, MY DOLL.
- AND SANTINO RICE.
- YOUR FANTASTIC FOUR, RU.
- FOR THEIR FINAL
CHALLENGE,
OUR QUEENS GOT TO
DANCE AND ACT
IN THE OFFICIAL VIDEO
FOR MY LATEST SINGLE,
"SISSY THAT WALK,"
AND NOW THEY'RE READY
TO FLY DOWN THE RUNWAY.
GENTLEMEN,
START YOUR ENGINES.
AND MAY THE BEST
WOMAN WIN.
FIRST UP, ADORE DELANO.
HOLLER!
- GRAPHIC.
- IS THAT A SEQUINS DRESS?
- YES.
- IT'S OUR LAST RUNWAY,
AND I'M SERVING
POWERFUL BITCH.
I HAVE BIG HAIR.
I LOOK LIKE
A GLITTERY-ASS MERMAID.
IT'S VERY "A STAR IS BORN."
- J'ADORE ADORE.
NEXT UP, BLAME IT
ON BIANCA DEL RIO.
WOW.
- LADY SINGS THE BLUES.
- I'M SERVING UP
OLD HOLLYWOOD GLAMOUR
IN MY MERIDIAN-BLUE
SATIN BIAS GOWN.
I KNOW RU IS LOVING MY DRESS.
SHE GOT GOOD TASTE.
- YES, SHE'S SERVING
BLUEFIN TUNA.
- NEXT UP, COURTNEY ACT.
- L.G.D.,
LITTLE GOLD DRESS.
- CHARLIE SAID I NEED TO
REPORT TO THE MAIN STAGE.
[LAUGHTER]
- I DECIDED TO GO WITH THE
QUINTESSENTIAL COURTNEY LOOK.
IT'S GLAMOROUS.
IT'S SEXY.
I'M GIVING PERFECT
POLISHED COURTNEY.
- EAT YOUR HEART OUT,
MIRANDA LAMBERT.
[LAUGHTER]
NOW LET'S TAKE A DIP
IN ONE OF AMERICA'S
GREAT LAKES...DARIENNE.
DEVIL IN A BLUE DRESS.
- SHAKE YOUR SHIMMY, SISTER.
- I AM SERVING
HIGH DRAG DIVA.
I'M FEELING GORGEOUS.
I'M FEELING SEXY.
THIS IS MY ABSOLUTE
BEST, BEST DRAG.
DARIENNE LAKE...
ON THE FRINGE.
- COMING UP, IT'S TIME
FOR THE JUDGES' FINAL CRITIQUE.
AND ONE OF YOU
WILL BE GOING HOME.
[RU PAUL LAUGHING]
- WELCOME, LADIES.
IT'S TIME FOR THE JUDGES'
FINAL CRITIQUE.
FIRST UP, ADORE.
- I THINK THIS IS A FLATTERING
DRESS FOR YOUR SHAPE.
I THINK YOUR FACE
LOOKS REALLY BEAUTIFUL.
THE HAIR TONIGHT--
I ALMOST THOUGHT YOU WERE
WEARING A HEADBAND
WHEN YOU CAME OUT HERE.
- THE SOLO DANCING,
THAT WAS REALLY GOOD.
YOU PUT ADORE INTO IT,
WHICH I ENJOYED.
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
ACTING TWO WAS MY FAVORITE.
I WAS IN A NOVELLA
WITH YOU,
BUT IT WAS GOOD ACTING.
YOU SOLD ME ON IT.
- THANK YOU, ADORE.
- THANK YOU, RU.
- NEXT UP, BLAME IT
ON BIANCA DEL RIO.
- TONIGHT THIS COLOR
IS BEAUTIFUL ON YOU.
- THANKS.
- AS A GROUP,
YOU AND COURTNEY ACT TOGETHER
REALLY WERE IN SYNC,
AND IT LOOKED GREAT.
- SOLO I THOUGHT YOU DID
A GOOD JOB AS WELL.
IT'S FUN TO SEE YOU
IN A SEXY LIGHT.
- FOR YOUR INGENUE,
YOUR EXPRESSIONS WERE SO FUNNY.
- AND THE IMPROV
WAS PHENOMENAL.
IT BEARS REPEATING.
IT WAS VERY FUNNY.
- NEXT UP, COURTNEY ACT.
TONIGHT, YOU LOOK FLAWLESS.
I DON'T THINK
I'D CHANGE A THING.
[LAUGHTER]
YEAH, REALLY,
JUST VERY, VERY HAPPY.
- YOU SHOULD BE ON THE COVER
OF "PLAYBOY" MAGAZINE.
YOU SHOULD HAVE
YOUR OWN SPREAD.
- LET'S DO IT.
- AS THE INGENUE,
THE SLAPS WERE REALLY FUNNY.
YOU WENT THERE.
AS SISSY WITH CHARLES,
THE PROPS,
LIKE THE GLASSES,
THEY KIND OF DISTRACTED
FROM YOUR FACE.
- GROUP CHOREOGRAPHY--
YOU NAILED IT.
- LOVED THE WIDE SHOTS,
BUT THE CLOSE-UPS SEEMS
SO FRENETIC AND KIND OF, UH...
TOO MUCH.
- ALL RIGHT. UP NEXT,
DARIENNE LAKE.
- TONIGHT IS JUST
CLASSIC DARIENNE,
AND IT'S SO,
SO BEAUTIFUL.
- YOUR LIP-SYNCING
IS SO MAJOR
IN YOUR PIECE
AS THE INGENUE,
I COULD WATCH THAT
ON REPEAT FOR HOURS.
I THOUGHT
THAT WAS SO FUNNY.
- AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN,
THAT SECOND ACTING CHALLENGE
WAS KIND OF LIKE THIS,
FLAT-LINED.
YOU DIDN'T REALLY GET IT GOING
TILL THE END.
BUT THEN WHEN YOU DID
GET IT GOING,
YOU KEPT IT GOING.
THAT WAS
THE MAGICAL PART.
- ALL RIGHT.
THANKS, DARIENNE.
LADIES, FINAL QUESTION--
WHY SHOULD YOU
AND NOT YOUR COMPETITORS
BE CROWNED AMERICA'S
NEXT DRAG SUPERSTAR?'
LET'S START WITH ADORE.
- THESE GIRLS UP HERE
ARE ALL STARS,
BUT I'M REALLY SORRY
ABOUT IT.
I'M AMERICA'S NEXT
DRAG SUPERSTAR.
I FEEL LIKE I'M RELATABLE.
I'M APPROACHABLE.
AND WITH THIS TITLE,
I WILL BE VERY PROUD
TO CARRY ON THE LEGACY
AND TEACH ALL THE LITTLE
MERMAIDS OF THE WORLD.
I JUST REALLY, REALLY
WANT TO MAKE YOU PROUD.
I'M ALREADY A WINNER,
BUT THE CROWN REALLY WOULD
COMPLETE THIS WHOLE LOOK
AND EVERYTHING.
AND I LOVE YOU GUYS.
THANK YOU.
- THANK YOU, ADORE.
BIANCA DEL RIO.
- THERE'S AN OLD SAYING
THAT YOU CAN'T TEACH
AN OLD DOG NEW TRICKS.
FOR ME, IT WASN'T GOING
THROUGH THE COMPETITION
WITH AN ADOLESCENT CHARM,
GOING THROUGH IT
WITH A FABULOUS BODY
AND BEAUTY,
OR GOING THROUGH IT
WITH GREAT LIP-SYNC TALENTS.
I HAD DRESSES, I HAD HAIR,
AND A GUARD.
I HAVE BUILT UP
THIS WALL,
AND THIS EXPERIENCE
HAS CHANGED ME,
AND I DIDN'T EXPECT IT
TO BE THIS MAGICAL
OR THIS INSPIRING,
BUT IT IS.
I WENT THROUGH
A SELF-DISCOVERY,
ACCEPTING THAT I'M NOT
SUCH A BAD BITCH,
AND I THANK
ALL OF YOU PERSONALLY
FROM THE BOTTOM
OF MY CHILLY LITTLE HEART
THANKS.
- THANK YOU, BIANCA.
NEXT UP, COURTNEY ACT,
SAME QUESTION.
- IN AUSTRALIA,
I'M AUSTRALIA'S DRAG SUPERSTAR.
AND I'VE HAD SO MANY WONDERFUL
OPPORTUNITIES THERE
TO HAVE A LOT OF GOOD MOMENTS
AND A LOT OF BAD MOMENTS
AND LEARN FROM
ALL OF THAT.
AND I SORT OF CAME
TO AMERICA
AS LIKE A POLISHED PRODUCT,
AND I FEEL THAT
I CAN TAKE THIS
AND I CAN MAKE
THE MOST OUT OF IT.
YOU SAY THIS IS
THE OLYMPICS OF DRAG,
AND I WANT TO TAKE
THAT OLYMPIC TORCH,
AND I WANT TO KEEP
RUNNING WITH IT,
AND I WANT TO BE AMERICA'S
NEXT DRAG SUPERSTAR.
- THANK YOU, COURTNEY.
- THANK YOU.
- DARIENNE LAKE.
- I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
MORE QUEEN PER POUND.
THERE IS NO
COMPARING ME TO OTHERS.
ADORE, SOMETIMES
YOU GET A LITTLE RATTLED.
BIANCA, I COULD TEACH YOU
MAYBE A LITTLE THING
ABOUT SENSITIVITY.
COURTNEY,
WHAT A SEXY DISH,
BUT THIS DISH
NEEDS A LITTLE SALT.
YOU HAVE SEEN
MY TALENTS.
I WILL MAKE EVERYONE
WHO IS SITTING THERE
THINKING THAT
THEY'RE NOT GOOD ENOUGH,
THAT IF THIS OLD
BITTER QUEEN CAN DO IT,
ANYBODY CAN DO IT.
THANK YOU.
- THANK YOU, DARIENNE.
WELL, THANK YOU,
MY QUEENS.
I THINK
WE'VE HEARD ENOUGH.
WHILE YOU UNWIND
IN THE UNTUCKED LOUNGE,
THE JUDGES AND I
WILL DELIBERATE.
ALL RIGHT, JUST BETWEEN
US SQUIRRELS,
WHAT DID WE THINK?
LET'S START WITH ADORE.
ADORE IS 23 YEARS OLD, AND HER
SPEECH ON THE MAIN STAGE
SPOKE LIKE SOMEONE
WHO'S 23 YEARS OLD.
- I REALLY FEEL LIKE
SHE WAS SPEAKING FROM THE HEART,
AND SHE GOT
HER POINT ACROSS.
- ADORE'S ACTING
WAS SO WELL DONE,
I FELT LIKE IT WAS
A REAL SCENE.
- SHE'S A PERFORMER.
ADORE IS DEFINITELY A SUPERSTAR.
- SHE LIKES THE SORT OF
TRASHY-GIRL AESTHETIC.
- BUT SHE'S JUST
SO DAMN CHARMING
THAT NO MATTER
WHAT SHE DOES,
I CAN'T TAKE MY EYES
OFF OF HER.
- LET'S TALK ABOUT
BIANCA DEL RIO.
- HER INGENUE WAS FUNNY,
AND SHE BRINGS HER INTELLIGENCE
TO THE GAME.
- IT BEARS REPEATING.
- IT'S HILARIOUS.
- TO ME, BIANCA COMES OFF
AS USING COMEDY AS A WALL.
HER SHTICK IS, "COLD AS ICE,
MY HEART IS BLACK."
- YEAH, HER HUMOR CAN BE
A LITTLE ABRASIVE AND DANGEROUS.
IS THAT THE BEST CHOICE
FOR THE BRAND?
- BUT THAT SPEECH THAT SHE MADE
WAS PRETTY AMAZING.
IT'S INTERESTING JUST SEEING
HER VULNERABILITY,
AND SHE HAD NO PROBLEM
HELPING THE OTHER GIRLS
BACK IN THE WORK ROOM
BECAUSE SHE WASN'T
THREATENED BY THEM.
- NO.
- I WOULD HAVE LIKED
TO HAVE HAD
MORE VARIETY IN
HER RUNWAY LOOKS, THOUGH.
- LET'S MOVE ON
TO COURTNEY ACT.
- IT'S OBVIOUS
THE CAMERA LOVES HER.
- YES. SHE HAS A PRESENCE.
SHE'S BEAUTIFUL.
- HER ACTING TWO CHALLENGE
WAS INTERESTING.
SHE HAD ALL THE SHTICK
WITH THE STRAW IN HER HAIR,
THE GLASSES COCKEYED.
- NOTHING WAS SUBTLE
ABOUT THAT PERFORMANCE.
- BUT SHE DID ALLUDE
TO THE FACT
THAT SHE DOESN'T SPEAK WITH
AN AUSTRALIAN ACCENT ANYMORE.
- WHICH I APPRECIATED.
- IT'S SUPER FUNNY.
- NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT
HER SPEECH ON THE MAIN STAGE.
- SHE'S AUSTRALIA'S
VERSION OF RU PAUL.
- RIGHT. THAT'S NOT
STRONG ENOUGH FOR ME.
I WANTED HER
TO MOVE ME.
- I DON'T GET MAD
WHEN PEOPLE TALK LIKE THAT,
ESPECIALLY
FROM COURTNEY ACT,
WHO I THINK IS
AN IMMENSE TALENT
AND WHO HAS CONSISTENTLY BROUGHT
AMAZING LOOKS TO THE RUNWAY.
- LET'S MOVE ON
TO DARIENNE LAKE.
- THE SECOND ACTING CHALLENGE,
WHEN SHE STARTED TO BREAK DOWN,
THEN I GOT SUCKED IN.
- HER DELIVERY WAS
JUST HILARIOUS, JUST SO FUNNY.
- AND IT EVEN MADE CHARLES
COME BACK IN AND GET HER.
- IN THE SISSY-OGRAPHY,
DARIENNE LAKE GOT DOWN
WITH THE GET-DOWN.
- SHE'S A FIERCE LIP-SYNCER.
- SHE IS.
- YOU KNOW, ALL ABOUT
SELLING FACE CONSTANTLY.
- IN FACT, SHE WON
THE "SCREAM QUEEN" CHALLENGE
JUST BECAUSE OF HER HEAD.
- I'VE WON LOTS OF STUFF
WITH MY HEAD.
- SILENCE!
BRING BACK MY GIRLS.
[RU PAUL LAUGHING]
- WELCOME BACK, LADIES.
NOW, BEFORE I CAN DECIDE
WHO MAKES IT TO THE TOP THREE,
I NEED TO SEE EACH OF YOU
LIP-SYNC FOR YOUR LIFE.
FOUR QUEENS
STAND BEFORE ME.
LADIES, THIS IS YOUR LAST
CHANCE TO IMPRESS ME
AND SAVE YOURSELF
FROM ELIMINATION.
THE TIME HAS COME...
FOR YOU TO LIP-SYNC
FOR YOUR LIFE.
- ALL FOUR OF US
HAVE TO LIP-SYNC,
AND WE'RE COMPETING
AGAINST EACH OTHER.
THIS IS LIKE
A LIP-SYNC DEATH MATCH.
- GOOD LUCK,
AND DON'T FUCK IT UP.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
- I'VE BEEN TRAINING
FOR THIS MOMENT MY ENTIRE LIFE.
IT'S KIND OF ODD
BEING AUSTRALIAN
AND BEING CROWNED AMERICA'S
NEXT DRAG SUPERSTAR.
BUT THAT'S WHAT
AMERICA IS ALL ABOUT.
IT'S THE GREAT
AMERICAN DREAM.
- I HAVE BEEN
ON THE BOTTOM,
BUT IT'S NOT HOW MANY TIMES
YOU GET KICKED DOWN,
IT'S HOW MANY TIMES
YOU CONTINUE TO GET BACK UP.
- I'M OUT THERE
FOR THE BIG GIRLS.
I AM A FIGHTER.
- I THINK THE REASON WHY I'M
AMERICA'S NEXT DRAG SUPERSTAR
IS BECAUSE I'M A GOOD
REPRESENTATION
OF THE NEW GIRLS WITHIN
THE DRAG COMMUNITY.
I HAVE SO MUCH HEART.
I HAVE SO MUCH DRIVE AND FIRE.
I WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW
THAT YOU CAN FOLLOW YOUR DREAMS
AND HAVE A PARTY
WHILE DOING IT.
- I SHOULD BE AMERICA'S
NEXT DRAG SUPERSTAR
BECAUSE I'VE PAID MY DUES
AND SHOWN MYSELF
IN THIS COMPETITION.
- I CAME, WORKED,
I CONQUERED.
AND I'D LIKE TO SHARE IT
WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD.
- HA HA HA!
WOW.
LADIES, YOU HAVE NOT
MADE IT EASY FOR ME.
BUT I'VE MADE
MY DECISION.
DARIENNE LAKE...
I'M SORRY, MY DEAR,
BUT YOU WILL NOT BE MOVING ON
TO THE TOP THREE.
- YOU KNOW, I'M LEAVING HERE
WITHOUT THE CROWN
BUT NOT EMPTY-HANDED.
I HAVE SERIOUSLY GROWN,
AND I HAVE MADE FRIENDS
FOR A SEASON,
A REASON,
OR A LIFETIME.
THANK YOU.
YOU ARE ONE RESILIENT
AND GORGEOUS GLAMAZON.
IT'S TIME FOR EVERYBODY
TO JUMP INTO THE REFRESHING,
UNFORGETTABLE WATERS
OF DARIENNE LAKE.
NOW...SASHAY AWAY.
- AND I WILL LEAVE
LIKE A TRUE DIVA.
GET OUT OF MY WAY.
I'VE COME THIS FAR,
AND TO GET SO CLOSE,
IT'S LIKE "THE WIZARD OF OZ"--
YOU GET THERE,
YOU'VE HAD TO KILL A WITCH,
OR A COUPLE OF THEM,
AND YOU GET NOTHING
AT THE END.
- I PRESENT TO THE WORLD
MY FINAL THREE.
ALL SEASON LONG,
I'VE CONSULTED WITH THE JUDGES,
AND NOW I WANT TO HEAR
FROM YOU, THE FANS.
WHO DO YOU THINK SHOULD BE
AMERICA'S NEXT DRAG SUPERSTAR?
ARE YOU TEAM ADORE,
TEAM BIANCA,
OR TEAM COURTNEY?
TWEET YOUR CHOICE
TO @RuPaulsDragRace
USING HASHTAG DragRace.
THEN KEEP
THE CONVERSATION GOING
ON THE "RU PAUL'S DRAG RACE"
FACEBOOK PAGE
USING HASHTAG DragRace.
LET YOUR VOICE
BE HEARD.
BUT REMEMBER,
THE FINAL DECISION
IS HASHTAG MINE TO MAKE.
NEXT WEEK, TUNE IN
FOR THE DEBUT
OF THE MUSIC VIDEO
"SISSY THAT WALK."
AND THE FOLLOWING WEEK,
THE WINNER WILL BE CROWNED
ON "RU PAUL'S DRAG RACE
REUNITED."
NOW, IF YOU CAN'T
LOVE YOURSELF,
HOW IN THE HELL ARE YOU
GONNA LOVE SOMEBODY ELSE?
CAN I GET
AN AMEN IN HERE?
- AMEN!
- ALL RIGHT.
NOW LET THE MUSIC PLAY.
[THEME MUSIC PLAYING]


- PREVIOUSLY ON
"RU PAUL'S DRAG RACE..."
- BITCH!
- LAGANJA AND I ARE
THE BEST OF FRIENDS,
BUT WHEN WE DO COMPETE,
THAT CAN GET UGLY.
- IT'S TIME TO PLAY
"SNATCH GAME."
- I DON'T DO
IMPERSONATIONS.
- KIMMY.
- HA HA HA!
- WE ORIGINATED THE LANGUAGE.
- BALONEY!
- HOW'S THE BABY?
- OH, YOU KNOW, I'M STILL, LIKE,
HAVING SOME MORNING AFTER...
IS THAT...YES, YOU KNOW,
LIKE THROWING UP AND STUFF
AFTER THE PREGNANCY.
- BEN DE LA CREME, YOU'RE
THE WINNER OF THIS CHALLENGE.
LAGANJA ESTRANJA,
SHANTE YOU STAY.
G-G-G-GIA,
SASHAY AWAY.
- WHOO!
- CONGRATULATIONS,
LAGANJA.
- I AM SO GRATEFUL THAT I AM
STILL IN THIS COMPETITION.
- YES, GIRL, YOU MADE IT.
- YOU LIVE ANOTHER DAY.
- BUT IN THE OUTSIDE WORLD,
I'M USED TO WINNING.
SO IN THIS COMPETITION,
IT'S REALLY HARD TO SEE ALL
MY FRIENDS GET A LOT OF PRAISE,
ESPECIALLY ADORE,
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK HER LOOK
IS AS STRONG AS MINE,
AND IT'S REALLY STARTING
TO GET TO ME.
- LAGANJA IS AN EXTREMELY
EMOTIONAL PERSON,
AND THAT'S GOING TO PLAY A TOLL
ON HER IN THE COMPETITION.
I THINK SHE'S JUST GOING TO
HAVE TO GET OUT OF HER FEELINGS
JUST AS MUCH
AS I DO, TOO.
- UM...WELL, MOST OF THE GIRLS--
I HAD ALREADY SHARED THIS
IN "UNTUCKED."
BUT I WANT TO TAKE
THE TIME OUT TO TELL EVERYBODY
AUGUST OF 2012, I WAS
DIAGNOSED WITH H.I.V.
I WANTED TO SHARE THAT
WITH EVERYBODY IN HERE
BECAUSE I WANTED TO BE
AN ADVOCATE FOR PEOPLE
IN THIS PARTICULAR COMMUNITY
WHO ARE SUFFERING WITH THIS
AND THEY'RE SCARED
TO SAY SOMETHING.
AND I NEED PEOPLE TO KNOW
THAT IT'S OK.
- I THINK ALL OF US THINK
THAT IS SO NOBLE AND COURAGEOUS.
[CLAPPING]
WE'RE PROUD OF YOU, GIRL.
- I THINK IT'S A HUGE STEP
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION
FOR TRINITY
TO SPEAK HER MIND.
I WAS REALLY, REALLY
IMPRESSED WITH THAT.
I THINK THAT'S
REALLY COMMENDABLE.
I THINK IT'S AMAZING.
GOOD JOB.
- ON A LIGHTER NOTE,
CONGRATULATIONS, MISS DE LA!
- THANK YOU.
- DID ANY OF THE ORIGINAL SIX
WIN TWO CHALLENGES?
- I WON A CHALLENGE.
YOU WON A CHALLENGE.
- I WON THE FIRST
CHALLENGE, TOO.
- OH, YOU DID? OH.
- I DID.
- I WASN'T THERE.
YEAH, IT DOESN'T COUNT.
I THINK IT'S BETTER
NOT TO STRUT AROUND
AND BE LIKE A PEACOCK
WHEN YOU WIN.
YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE
THAT YOU'RE NOT
TOO IN LOVE WITH YOURSELF.
BEN DE LA CREME.
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THAT'S ABOUT.
- I'VE GOT
TO SEND HER HOME.
- THE WINNER OF
"RU PAUL'S DRAG RACE"
RECEIVES A SICKENING SUPPLY
OF COLOREVOLUTION COSMETICS
AND A CASH PRIZE
OF $100,000,
WITH EXTRA-SPECIAL
GUEST JUDGES--
THE DIAMOND PRINCESS TRINA
AND THE E-V-E, EVE.
- GOOD MORNING.
- MORNING.
- SO IT'S A NEW DAY,
AND WE HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT'S TO COME.
I'M FEELING GREAT
IN THE COMPETITION SO FAR.
SO I KNOW SOMETHING AROUND
THE CORNER IS GONNA FUCK ME UP.
- SO, WHAT ARE
PEOPLE THINKING?
- MAYBE IT WILL BE
AN INDIVIDUAL CHALLENGE.
- I THINK WE'RE ALL COOL WITH
INDIVIDUAL CHALLENGE, RIGHT?
- I COMPLETELY AM.
I'M NOT A GROUP PERSON.
I'M MORE OF A BEYONCE MYSELF.
- AT LEAST BEYONCE'S DRESSES
HIT THE FLOOR.
- WHOO!
- SO DO YOUR TITS!
- OOH!
- GIRL, YOU GOT SHE-MAIL.
YO, FLY GIRLS, AMERICA'S
NEXT DRAG SUPERSTAR
NEEDS TO GET
HER FREAK ON,
SHAKE WHAT HER MAMA
GAVE HER,
AND THEN DROP IT
LIKE IT'S HOT.
YOU DOWN WITH O.P.P.?
- YOU KNOW ME!
- HEY, LATIFA,
PAGE ME, GIRL.
- YAY! I'M READY.
- HELLO, HELLO, HELLO.
- HELLO.
- ALL RIGHT.
- LADIES, TODAY'S MINI CHALLENGE
IS SPONSORED BY...
THE LETTER "T,"
AS IN ALL "T,"
ALL SHADE, HUNTIES.
IN THE GREAT TRADITION
OF "PARIS IS BURNING..."
THE LIBRARY IS OPEN!
[CHEERING]
- BECAUSE READING IS WHAT?
- FUNDAMENTAL.
- THERE YOU HAVE IT,
DARLING.
FIRST UP,
BIANCA DEL RIO.
THE LIBRARY
IS NOW OPEN.
- HA HA HA!
- MISS BEN DE LA CREME,
AFTER SEEING YOU IN DRAG,
I REALIZE NOW WHY SEATTLE HAS
A HIGH SUICIDE RATE.
- HA HA HA!
- OH, MY GOD.
- JOSLYN FOX, SHE'S SO GAY,
EVEN HER ASSHOLE HAS A LISP.
THEN WE HAVE ADORE.
I KNOW WHAT YOU GOT
ON YOUR S.A.T.'s.
KETCHUP.
[LAUGHTER]
- TRINITY, I BELIEVE YOUR SMILE
BELONGS ON SEASON 4.
EVERY DAY IS SHARK WEEK
WITH YOUR GRILL.
MISS LAGANJA ESTRANJA,
NEXT TIME YOU DEATH DROP,
REVERSE THAT AND DROP DEAD.
[LAUGHTER]
- DARIENNE LAKE,
I WEIGH, LIKE, 110,
AND I'M REALLY
SCARED OF YOU,
SO I'M JUST GONNA
KEEP IT AT THAT.
- YOU BETTER.
- AND I'M SURE YOU ALL
WILL REMIND ME
THAT MY HAIR IS SO FRIED
AND DAMAGED
THAT I'M FORCED TO WEAR
THIS CLIP-ON PONYTAIL.
IF YOU CAN'T READ YOURSELF,
HOW THE HELL CAN YOU
READ SOMEBODY ELSE? THANK YOU.
- JOSLYN FOX, YOU MAY NOT
BE ALL THAT SMART,
AND YOU MAY NOT BE
ALL THAT PRETTY...
- HA HA HA!
- I GUESS THAT'S IT.
- HA HA HA!
- MISS DARIENNE LAKE,
YOU SHOULD BE ARRESTED
FOR ANIMAL CRUELTY.
THE WAY YOU ABUSE THOSE
KITTEN HEELS ON THE RUNWAY
IS ABSOLUTELY CRIMINAL!
- BEN DE LA CREME,
THE CREAM ALWAYS
RISES TO THE TOP,
BUT THEN AGAIN,
SO DOES THE SCUM.
[LAUGHTER AND JEERING]
MISS JOSLYN FOX,
WHEN WE NEED
A LOW-RENT VERSION OF COURTNEY
ACT, WE'LL LET YOU KNOW.
[LAUGHTER]
- ADORE, YOU KNOW YOU'RE
FROM THE WEST COAST
BECAUSE IT'S A 3-HOUR DELAY
BEFORE YOU FINALLY GET A JOKE.
- HA HA HA!
- DARIENNE LAKE--
THIS IS THE GIRL
WHO PROBABLY SITS
REVERSE COWGIRL
ON THE TOILET
JUST SO SHE HAS A FLAT
SURFACE TO EAT OFF OF.
- OOH!
- JOSLYN, YOU HAVE
SOME REALLY COMFORTING
OLD-FASHIONED QUALITIES,
LIKE HOW YOU PAINT
IN SEPIA TONES
AND YOUR VOICE SOUNDS
LIKE A DIAL-UP MODEM.
[DIAL-UP MODEM SOUNDS]
MISS DARIENNE LAKE,
YOU HAVE A LOT OF JOKES,
BUT TO ME THEY'RE
MORE LIKE UFO's--
I MEAN, THEY ARE
WAY OUT THERE,
AND I'VE NEVER
SEEN ONE LAND.
- HA HA HA!
- A-BORE DE-LAME-O, IS THAT
A HOG ON YOUR BODY,
OR ARE YOU
EXCITED TO SEE ME?
- HA HA HA.
- BIANCA DEL TACO TRIO,
YOUR STYLE IS AS OLD
AND BITTER AS YOU.
YOU'VE EVEN GOT THE CRYPT-KEEPER
CRYING, "WHOO-HOO-HOO."
- THANK YOU, DR. SEUSS.
- MILK, YOUR BEAUTY
AND FASHION
IS LISTED RIGHT ON THE SIDE
OF YOUR CARTON,
UNDER "MISSING."
[LAUGHTER]
BEN DE LA CREME,
YOU REMIND ME
OF A RUSSIAN DOLL--
FULL OF YOURSELF.
[LAUGHTER]
- ADORE DELANO,
I'M GOING TO SAY THIS
VERY SLOWLY
SO YOU CAN UNDERSTAND.
YOU'RE DUMB.
[LOUD LAUGHTER]
- ALL RIGHT, THE LIBRARY
IS REALLY CLOSED OFFICIALLY.
[NO AUDIO]
THE WINNER IS...
DARIENNE LAKE.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
SHADY BITCH.
OK, LADIES.
IT'S TIME TO PROVE YOU'RE SOME
HARDCORE O.G.'s.
YOU KNOW
WHAT I'M SAYING?
ORIGINAL GLAMAZONS.
FOR THIS WEEK'S
MAIN CHALLENGE,
YOU'RE GONNA FACE OFF
IN A NINETIES-STYLE
RAP BATTLE ROYALE.
Y'ALL NEED TO WRITE
AND PERFORM YOUR OWN RAP
TO A TRACK PRODUCED
BY DJ SHYBOY
CALLED "OH, NO,
SHE BETTER DON'T!"
DARIENNE LAKE, SINCE YOU WON
THE MINI CHALLENGE,
YOU CHOOSE THE 4 M.C. QUEENS
YOU WANT ON YOUR CREW.
- LAGANJA ESTRANJA.
WHO'S GOT A FAST MOUTH?
BIANCA DEL RIO.
- HA HA HA!
- AND I MEAN, I WOULD BE STUPID
NOT TO PICK TWO OF MY IDOLS--
ADORE DELANO
AND COURTNEY ACT.
- I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT DARIENNE
ISN'T CHOOSING ME.
IT'S A LITTLE BIT
OF A SLAP IN THE FACE
TO NOT BE CHOSEN WITH THE REST
OF THOSE GIRLS.
- AND THAT MEANS
THE OTHER CREW
IS MILK, BEN DE LA CREME, JOSLYN
FOX, AND TRINITY K. BONET.
GENTLEMEN,
START YOUR ENGINES,
AND DON'T GET CAUGHT SLEEPING
ON YOUR CHARISMA,
UNIQUENESS, NERVE, AND TALENT.
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?
THIS IS THE CHALLENGE
THAT I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR.
AND THEN WE DO THIS
I LOVE TO RAP,
AND I'M A PROFESSIONAL
CHOREOGRAPHER.
- WHY ARE WE ALL
DOING THIS SHIT?
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
THE FUCK THAT MEANS.
NINETIES RAP IS REALLY
ABOUT THE FEEL.
IT'S VERY THAT.
IT'S NOT LIKE...
[HUMMING] FUCKIN'...
- I HATE THIS.
I DON'T REALLY WANT TO LOOK
LIKE 'N SYNC, BITCH.
I WANT TO LOOK LIKE
SALT-N-PEPA.
- COMING UP...
- SO, DARIENNE,
WHY DIDN'T YOU CHOOSE ME?
- OOH!
- OOH!
- I'M A WHITE LADY
FROM THE SUBURBS.
SO WHEN IT COMES
TO STREET CRED...
JEEZ. FUCK!
- OK.
[RU PAUL LAUGHING]
- OUR MAIN CHALLENGE
IS A RAP BATTLE,
LIKE WE'RE FLY GIRLS
IN THE NINETIES.
WE'VE GOT TO COME UP
WITH COSTUMING,
LYRICS, AND CHOREOGRAPH
A WHOLE HIP-HOP DANCE.
LET'S JUST SEE
WHERE WE'RE ALL AT,
AND THEN WE CAN SEE WHERE
WE NEED TO GO FROM THAT.
- DO YOU WANT TO START?
- I DO THINK THAT THIS IS
A PRIME OPPORTUNITY
FOR YOU TO PRACTICE
YOUR ENUNCIATION.
- FUCK THAT. YOU DON'T
TELL ME ABOUT ENUNCIATING.
YOU UNENUNCIATE. SHIT.
THIS IS HOW I TALK.
- JUST REALLY MAKE SURE YOU,
LIKE, REALLY, LIKE,
WRAP YOUR MOUTH AROUND
ALL THOSE VOWELS
AND ALL THE CONSONANTS
INDIVIDUALLY.
- THIS IS RAP.
YOU AIN'T SUPPOSED TO USE
NO SYLLABLES, NO VOWELS.
IT'S JUST ALL
STREET SLANG.
- I'M SO EXCITED
ABOUT THAT.
THIS IS ACTUALLY A REALLY FUN
CHALLENGE FOR ME,
BECAUSE I SPIT ILL SHIT
ON A FUCKING DAILY.
- THAT'S GOOD.
- I'M FUCKING HOOD.
I'M FROM AZUSA.
I'LL STAB A BITCH.
HA HA HA!
- UM...I NEED HELP.
- I'M A WHITE LADY
FROM THE SUBURBS.
SO WHEN IT COMES
TO STREET CRED...
- YOU JUST NEED
ANOTHER WORD IN THERE.
- THAT'S WHY I PICKED YOU GUYS
TO BE ON MY TEAM,
BECAUSE YOU'RE RAP PEOPLE.
- JUST BECAUSE DARIENNE
HAS PICKED
THE STRONGEST GIRLS
FOR HER TEAM
DOESN'T MEAN THAT SHE'S
GOING TO BE SAFE.
- LET'S WORK ON
THE GROUP CHOREOGRAPHY.
- I'M A DANCER, SO NOW I'M GONNA
HAVE TO SHOW THESE HOS
WHAT IT IS THAT I DO.
SO, YOUR MOTION
WOULD BE...
UP, SLIDE, PULL.
YOU DON'T WANT TO LOOK SO...
LIKE YOU'RE THROWING IT.
YOU JUST WANT IT TO BE
KIND OF LIKE...
- OK. YOU HAVE TO
BREAK THIS DOWN
SO BABY-STEPS FOR ME.
YOU HEAR THE PHRASE, YOU KNOW,
THAT THEY HAVE TWO LEFT FEET.
THERE YOU GO.
BUT SOME OF MY GIRLS
AIN'T GOT NO FEET.
[CLANGING]
- OOH!
- HA HA!
- YO, YO, YO!
- HI!
- HOW ARE MY HIP-HOP
DRAG QUEENS DOING?
- MAKIN' DAT MONEY.
- WORD.
- NOW HERE'S THE 411.
TO HELP YOU WITH YOUR FLOW,
IN A MOMENT,
YOU'LL MEET WITH TWO OF THE
HOTTEST RAPPERS IN THE GAME--
THE BADDEST BITCH TRINA...
[GASPING]
- OH, MY GOD!
- AND THE PIT BULL
IN A SKIRT,
THE E-V-E, EVE IS HERE.
[CHEERING]
SO GOOD LUCK,
AND DON'T...
WICKY-WICKY-WICKY-WICKY...
FUCK IT UP. OK?
- THANK YOU, MAMA RU.
- SO DARIENNE, HOW DID YOU
CHOOSE YOUR GROUP?
- HOW DID I CHOOSE MY GROUP?
- YEAH.
- THAT SOUNDED REALLY SHADY.
- RIGHT?
- WHAT WAS IT, DARIENNE? WHY
DON'T YOU ENLIGHTEN THIS BITCH?
- I REALLY WAS...I MEAN--
- NO, YOU WEREN'T.
I CAUGHT IT.
- I'LL BE DIRECT
ABOUT IT.
DARIENNE, WHY
DIDN'T YOU CHOOSE ME?
- AND I'LL BE
COMPLETELY HONEST.
IT'S NONE OF YOUR
FUCKING BUSINESS.
- OOH!
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
I DON'T HAVE TIME TO DEAL
WITH THIS RIGHT NOW.
WHEN I THINK
NINETIES RAP GIRL,
MY FIRST THOUGHT ISN'T
TO GO TO DE LA.
- I WAS NOT ACTUALLY
TRYING TO BE SHADY,
AND I CAME OFF THAT WAY MAYBE
BECAUSE MY FEELINGS WERE HURT.
- SUCK IT UP, BUTTERCUP.
- COME ON, PANTY HOS.
- OK.
- WE WALK IN, AND I SEE
THE SCRUFF PIT CREW,
EVE, AND TRINA.
IT'S LIKE WALKING IN TO PLAY
CHESS WITH BOBBY FISCHER.
YEAH, YOU'RE GONNA SHIT
YOUR PANTS A LITTLE BIT.
- WELCOME, PANTY HOS.
- YES.
- HI.
- IT'S TIME
FOR THE SOLOS.
BIANCA DEL RIO.
- ROLL TRACK.
YOU LIKE THAT?
I MADE THAT SHIT UP TODAY.
- HA HA HA!
NOW IT'S TIME
FOR YOUR WIDE.
SO GIVE IT TO US
WIDE AND SASSY.
- WIDE AND SASSY.
THAT WAS MY NAME IN PRISON.
[LAUGHTER]
- BIANCA IS DOING
AMAZING.
SHE'S FUCKING HILARIOUS.
SHE'S EVERYTHING I WANT TO BE
WHEN I'M 57.
HA HA HA!
SHE'S GONNA KILL ME.
- WHO'S UP NEXT?
- HI. I'M ADORE.
- HI!
- HI, ADORE.
- UH-OH. HA HA HA!
- SHE'S NOT FULLY TUCKED.
SHH! PARTY.
DID I DO IT WRONG?
OK. SORRY.
- NO. ALL GOOD. ONE MORE TIME.
- I THINK YOU WERE TOO EARLY.
[STAMMERING]
- CUT.
- OOH. FUCK.
- I LIKE THAT YOU
KEPT GOING.
YOU GET ONE MORE CHANCE, AND
THEN THAT'S THE ONE THAT'S IT.
GOOD. WHO'S NEXT?
I FUCKED IT UP.
- YOU GOT TO GET
THE LYRICS RIGHT.
- SORRY. ONE SECOND.
- OH! GIRL!
[MUTTERING LYRICS]
SHIT!
I CAN'T REMEMBER IT.
FUCK! FUCK, FUCK, FUCK.
- IF YOU FORGOT THE LYRICS,
JUST CALM YOURSELF.
IT'LL COME BACK TO YOU.
- YEAH.
- I GOT IT.
- BAM.
- THANK YOU, JESUS.
- ALL RIGHT. CUE THE TRACK.
- FOR LAGANJA TO BE
A RAPSTRESS,
SHE KIND OF FELT
LIKE A LITTLE WHITE GIRL.
- OH, PLEASE.
- NEXT, M.C. CONTROL TOP.
[CRASH]
- OOH!
- UH-OH.
- YOU ALL RIGHT?
- ARE YOU OK?
- YEAH, I'M GOOD.
I FEEL SO TENSE
IN THIS SITUATION,
BECAUSE IT'S SO OUT
OF MY COMFORT ZONE.
- CUE TRACK.
[MUTTERING LYRICS]
FUCK! I'M SORRY.
- CUT. CUT.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
- WELL, FUCK
BEGINNER'S LUCK.
- I THINK YOU'RE
THINKING TOO HARD
ABOUT THE PERFORMANCE
OF THE SONG.
JUST GIVE IT
ANOTHER SHOT.
- CUT. CUT.
- FUCK ME.
- DARIENNE'S IN TROUBLE,
AND I'M WORRIED.
THAT COULD FUCK UP
OUR WHOLE TEAM.
SHE'S OVERTHINKING,
AND SHE'S...
SHE'S THINKING
ABOUT A SANDWICH.
- COMING UP...
- IT'S TIME FOR THE RU-TANG
CLAN TO TAKE THE STAGE.
CREMINEM IS IN THE HIZZY
FO' SHIZ, BOY!
[MUSIC PLAYING]
- OH, SORRY.
THAT WAS MY CUE.
- YEAH, THAT WAS YOUR CUE.
[RU PAUL LAUGHING]
- WHAT UP, DAWGS?
- WHAT UP?
- HI.
- IT'S TIME FOR THE RU-TANG CLAN
TO TAKE THE STAGE
FOR OUR RAP BATTLE,
AND WE ARE PUMPED,
WE ARE LOOKING FLY,
AND WE ARE GOING TO GIVE IT.
- CREMINEM, GIVE IT TO US.
CUE THE TRACK.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
- OH, SORRY. THAT WAS MY CUE.
WAS THAT MY CUE?
- YEAH, THAT WAS YOUR CUE.
- IT'S THAT LITTLE EFFECT?
I'M SORRY.
BBBBLLLL!
THIS NEXT ONE
IS GONNA BE AMAZING.
- WHAT LANGUAGE
WAS THAT?
- I MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST
RAPPER IN THE WORLD,
BUT CREMINEM IS IN THE HIZZY
FO' SHIZ, BOY!
- OK, MILK, IT IS
YOUR TURN UP NEXT.
- CUT.
- WHAT ARE YOU SAYING
AT THAT PART?
- IF YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR A DUDE
OR YOU'RE IN
THE PREGGERS MOOD.
- OK. LET'S DO
YOUR WIDE SHOT.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
[LAUGHING]
- I DON'T CARE IF THIS
IS NINETIES HIP-HOP.
IT'S PROBABLY NOT,
BUT I AM JUST GETTING
DOWN AND DIRTY.
- OK.
- I JUST HOPE THAT EVE AND TRINA
ARE LAUGHING WITH HER
AND NOT AT HER.
- OK. CUT. CUT.
WE GOT IT.
WE GOT ENOUGH.
WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON NOW.
MCTKB.
- NOW, IF I FUCK UP,
IT'S BECAUSE THIS IS NOT
MY, YOU KNOW, MY FORTE.
AND I MAY GET MY INTRO
WRONG THE FIRST TIME.
LET ME LISTEN.
- A DISCLAIMER, GIRL?
AH...
- JUST GIVE IT TO US.
- OK. ROLL TRACK.
- UH-OH.
- MM-HMM.
FUCK!
I CANNOT FUCK THIS UP,
BUT I'M FUCKING IT UP, SO...
- TAKE A BREATH.
THINK ABOUT IT.
- EXHALE.
- YEAH.
- GO AHEAD.
- I JUST THINK TRINITY
NEEDS TO JUST BE
A LOT MORE CONFIDENT.
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
- SHE KIND OF PSYCHED HERSELF
OUT BEFORE SHE STARTED.
- IT'S OK.
IT'S ALL GOOD.
- I'M FEELING FOR TRINITY
BECAUSE SHE REALLY WANTS
TO DO REALLY WELL, BUT...
[DING]
- I HONESTLY HAD NO IDEA
WHAT SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT.
- FUCK!
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
WHAT'S UP?
- HI!
- COME ON, LADY RAPPERS.
- TODAY'S RUNWAY LOOK
IS CRAZY SEXY FOOL.
- LET'S DO THIS, MAMAS.
- WHEN ALL ELSE FAILS,
YOU JUST HAVE TO KEEP IT FOXY.
WAH WAH!
- SO, MILK, YOU'RE GONNA
GIVE US GLAMOUR?
- UM...GLAMOUR. YEAH.
- SPOOK-HOUSE GLAMOUR
OR REAL GLAMOUR?
- UM...
- "UM" IS NOT AN ANSWER, SIR!
- LOVE IT.
- I THINK MILK
COULD PULL IT OFF,
BUT AS YOU CAN TELL BY THE WAY
MY VOICE IS GOING REALLY HIGH,
I COULD BE LYING.
- HOW ARE YOU FEELING,
MISS TRINITY?
- I'M GREAT.
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?
- YOU KNOW THAT I DON'T GET
VERY SERIOUS OR VERY NICE
ABOUT MANY THINGS.
I JUST WANTED
TO SAY TO YOU
THAT I'M VERY PROUD OF YOU FOR
PUTTING YOUR STORY OUT THERE.
- AS SOON AS TRINITY
DISCUSSED HER STATUS,
IT ALL MADE SENSE TO ME
AS TO WHY SHE WAS BEING
SUCH AN INTROVERT
AND ANTISOCIAL, BECAUSE
I'D BEEN THROUGH IT
WITH SOMEONE ELSE
BEFORE.
I HAD A FRIEND OF MINE.
FOR A WHILE,
WHEN I MOVED TO NEW YORK,
I DIDN'T GET TO SPEAK TO HIM,
DIDN'T HEAR FROM HIM,
AND I HAD NO IDEA
WHAT REALLY WAS HAPPENING.
AND I HAD FOUND OUT
THROUGH EVERYONE ELSE
THAT HE WAS HIV-POSITIVE,
AND HE DIDN'T FEEL THE NEED
TO DISCUSS IT WITH ANYONE
BECAUSE HE WAS
SO FULL OF SHAME.
SO THE STIGMA WITH THIS ISSUE
AND THIS SICKNESS...
AND IT WAS JUST FAR TOO MUCH
FOR HIM TO HANDLE.
I HAD FOUND OUT
THAT HE HAD PASSED AWAY.
- WHEN I FOUND OUT, LIKE,
IT WASN'T A SENSE
OF "OH, MY GOD,
MY LIFE IS OVER."
LIKE, THE FIRST THING WAS,
"HOW DO WE FIX IT?"
I JUST KNEW THAT THERE WAS
SO MUCH IN LIFE
THAT I WANTED TO ACHIEVE
AND THAT I WASN'T GONNA ALLOW
H.I.V. TO GET
IN THE WAY.
- I REALLY DO ADMIRE TRINITY
FOR BEING OPEN AND HONEST
AND TAKING CARE OF HERSELF
THE WAY SHE DOES,
BECAUSE IF MY FRIEND
HAD DONE THE SAME,
I THINK THINGS WOULD HAVE
TURNED OUT DIFFERENTLY.
I THINK WHAT YOU'VE DONE
IS AN AMAZING THING,
AND IF YOU EVER NEED ANYTHING,
CALL A HATEFUL BITCH LIKE ME,
EVEN IF IT'S FOR A LAUGH.
- BIANCA'S SECRETLY ADORABLE
IN A CERTAIN WAY,
LIKE SHE'S THE TYPE
OF PERSON
WHERE YOU, LIKE,
WANT TO HUG HER,
AND SHE'S JUST LIKE,
"UH, GET AWAY."
LIKE, IT'S VERY THAT,
BUT SHE LOVES YOU.
AND WHAT?
WHOO! WELCOME
TO THE MAIN STAGE
OF "RU PAUL'S DRAG RACE."
MY HOMEGIRL, MICHELLE
"MISDEMEANOR" VISAGE.
HOW ARE YOU DOING?
- LET ME BLOW
YOUR MIND, BOO.
AND DA BRAT, SANTINO RICE.
WHAT UP, G?
- LET THE RHYTHM
HIT 'EM, RU.
- HA HA HA!
- AND TRINA. ARE MY GIRLS
THE BADDEST BITCHES?
- YES, THEY SURE ARE.
- WELL, YOU WOULD KNOW.
- AND EVE. HEY, GIRL, HOW WAS IT
WORKING WITH MY QUEENS?
- AMAZING. AND YOU
LOOK AMAZING.
- OH, I BET YOU SAY THAT
TO ALL THE DRAG QUEENS.
THIS WEEK,
WE CHALLENGED OUR QUEENS
TO BECOME NINETIES RAPPERS,
AND NOW THEY'RE
READY TO SHOW OFF
THEIR FAVORITE BODY PARTS
IN OUTFITS
THAT ARE CRAZY SEXY COOL.
GENTLEMEN,
START YOUR ENGINES,
AND MAY THE BEST
WOMAN WIN.
COMING UP...
- THE CLOTHES WERE
WAY OFF FOR ME.
- THE RAP
WASN'T ON BEAT.
- YOU FREAKED YOURSELF OUT.
- SECURITY.
[RU PAUL LAUGHING]
- NOW SISSY THAT WALK.
FIRST UP, THE FOXY
JOSLYN FOX.
FOX ON THE RUNWAY.
SOMEBODY'S ROCKIN'-KNOCKIN'
THE BOOTS, TOO.
- MY RUNWAY LOOK
IS TYPICAL JOSLYN.
I KNOW MY ASS
IS LOOKING GREAT,
AND I'M FEELING
SUPER-CONFIDENT.
- HONEY, SHE IS STRAPPED.
IT AIN'T NOTHING
BUT A G-STRING.
BEN DE LA CREME.
- PURR-FECT.
- YES. CREMINEM DEVILLE.
- I'M SERVING UP
SOME ELIZABETH TAYLOR.
I JUST SKINNED
A SNOW LEOPARD.
I'M A CURVY GIRL,
AND I FEEL GORGEOUS.

HAS ANYBODY SEEN MY DOG?
- HA HA HA!
- TRINITY K. BONET.
IT'S BLACK CHER.
- HA HA HA!
WHY IT GOT TO BE BLACK?
- I AM SERVING YOU
HIPPIE CHIC FLOWER-POWER FISH.
I LOOK ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS,
AS USUAL.
- PEACE, QUEEN.
- YES. HALF-BREED--
HALF MAN, HALF WOMAN.
- HA HA HA!
- MILK...
SERVING FISH TAIL.
- MILK IS SERVING UP
SOME THRIFT-SHOP GLAMOUR.
I AM FEELING GORGEOUS!
- I WOULD DRINK THIS
TALL GLASS OF MILK.
- OOH, SHE'S A DAIRY QUEEN.
LAGANJA ESTRANJA.
- WHOO! STRUT.
THE FREAKS
COME OUT AT NIGHT.
- LOOK OUT, HONEY.
HERE COMES MAMA.
I'M SERVING BULLETPROOF.
Y'ALL CAN'T TAKE IT.
- NOW, HOW DID SHE GET THROUGH
THE METAL DETECTORS
IS WHAT I WANT TO KNOW.
SECURITY.
- HA HA HA!
- IT'S TIME TO TAKE A DIP
INTO THE MARVELOUS WATERS
OF DARIENNE LAKE.
OH, YES, THE STARS
HAVE COME OUT TONIGHT.
- I DEFINITELY AM FEELING
CRAZY SEXY COOL.
LIKE, YOU MAY THINK I'M CRAZY
TO LOOK THIS SEXY,
AND I'M COOL
WITH THAT.
- LOVE, LOVE, LOVE
THAT DRESS.
- PEEKAROO. I SEE
YOUR PANTY LINE,
AND I LIKE IT.
BLAME IT
ON BIANCA DEL RIO.
- WOW!
- FLY GIRL.
- GOLDEN LADY.
- SHE LOVES ONLY GOLD.
- I'M GIVING GOOD SIXTIES
"VALLEY OF THE DOLLS"
KAFTAN REALNESS.
I AM FEELING THE FANTASY.
- YES, HUNTY. YES.
GLITTER TITS.
HA HA HA!
- ADORE DELANO.
- SHE'S A MOTHER-TUCKER MONSTER.
- WHENEVER I PUT
FAKE LEATHER ON MY BODY,
I COMPLETELY
TURN INTO CAT WOMAN.
I HAVE ABOUT 5 LIVES LEFT,
SO WHY NOT JUST LIVE IT UP?
IT'S A PARTY.
- NO GLOVE, NO LOVE.
- UH-UH.
- HA HA!
- BAD KITTY.
[LAUGHTER]
- BLACK PANTHER ON THE RUNWAY.
- HA HA!
- COURTNEY ACT.
- SHH. SHE'S SLEEPING.
- WHO ARE YOU WEARING?
AND WHAT'S THE THREAD COUNT?
- OH!
- GOOD MORNING.
- JUST LIKE
LINDA EVANGELISTA,
I DON'T ROLL OUT OF BED
FOR ANYTHING LESS THAN $10,000.
I'M SERVING BODY-ODY-ODY.
I THINK THIS COULD BE
THE TIGHTEST TUCK OF MY CAREER.
- SHE GIVES GREAT BED-HEAD.
- LOVE THE ASS.
- WHAT'S YOUR SLEEP NUMBER?
- WELCOME, LADIES.
LET'S FLASH BACK
TO THE NINETIES
AND WATCH YOUR PERFORMANCES
IN "OH, NO, SHE BETTER DON'T,"
STARRING RU-TANG CLAN
AND THE PANTY HOS.
[HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING]
- IT'S THE RU-TANG CLAN.
- THE PANTY HOS!
[LAUGHTER]
- YEAH.
WOW!
GORGEOUS!
THE SINGLE "OH, NO,
SHE BETTER DON'T,"
PRODUCED BY DJ SHYBOY,
IS AVAILABLE ON iTUNES,
AND A PORTION
OF THE PROCEEDS
WILL GO TO THE L.A. GAY
AND LESBIAN CENTERS'
HOMELESS YOUTH SERVICES.
AND NOW IT'S TIME
FOR THE JUDGES' CRITIQUES.
COMING UP...
- THE HIP-HOP WAS
SOMETHING THAT THREW YOU.
- YOU WERE NOT
ON RHYTHM, GIRL.
- DON'T BE A CLICHE, MY DEAR.
[RU PAUL LAUGHING]
- LADIES, THIS WEEK
YOU WORKED IN GROUPS,
BUT TONIGHT, YOU'LL BE
JUDGED INDIVIDUALLY.
COURTNEY ACT.
IT'S A CLICHE, BUT YOU'RE
RESTING ON PRETTY.
DON'T BE A CLICHE, MY DEAR.
COURTNEY ACT.
BEN DE LA CREME
AND LAGANJA ESTRANJA...
YOU ARE...SAFE.
- THANK YOU.
- YOU MAY LEAVE
THE STAGE.
NOW IT'S TIME
FOR THE JUDGES' CRITIQUES.
LET'S START WITH
JOSLYN FOX.
- YOUR RUNWAY LOOK
IS A BIT BUSY.
- ALL THE LAYERS
ON TOP OF LAYERS,
IT JUST STARTS TO GET
A LITTLE MESSY FOR ME.
- I DO FEEL LIKE I TEND
TO OVERACCESSORIZE.
- I ALWAYS
LOVE IT MYSELF.
BUT, YOU KNOW, IF YOU WANT TO
PLEASE THESE BITCHES UP HERE,
YOU KNOW,
YOU'VE GOT TO...
- I THINK YOUR RAP WAS GREAT.
I LOVE "MOTHER-FISHER."
[LAUGHTER]
- YOU REALLY STEPPED UP,
AND I'M VERY PROUD OF YOU.
- HA HA. THANK YOU.
- ALL RIGHT. NEXT UP,
TRINITY K. BONET-NET.
HEY, GIRL.
- YOU GIVE ME
NAOMI CAMPBELL DOWN.
- NOW LET'S MOVE
TO THE RAP.
THE LOOK WAS
REALLY SPOT-ON.
IT WAS SALT-N-PEPA
MEETS ANITA BAKER.
BUT YOU WERE NOT
ON RHYTHM, GIRL.
- YOU FREAKED YOURSELF OUT.
- YOU KNOW, I'VE NEVER BEEN
THE QUEEN TO MAKE EXCUSES,
BUT THIS IS NOT SOMETHING
THAT I'M ACCUSTOMED TO.
I LIP-SYNC FOR A LIVING.
THAT'S WHAT I DO.
- ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU, TRINITY.
NEXT UP, MILK.
- THE RAP WASN'T
ON BEAT,
BUT IT WAS YOUR OWN
PERSONALIZED UNIQUENESS.
YOU JUST WENT INTO
THIS LITTLE FUNNY...
YEAH, I LOVE THAT.
THAT WAS JUST SO YOU.
- THE CLOTHES WERE
WAY OFF FOR ME.
YOU HAD, LIKE, JOEY BUTTAFUOCO
ZUBAZ PANTS ON.
NOTHING TO DO
WITH HIP-HOP.
LOTS TO DO WITH THE BOYS I USED
TO HAVE SEX WITH AT THE GYM.
TONIGHT ON THE RUNWAY,
IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU
WITH PRETTY MAKEUP ON.
BUT I WOULDN'T EVER TURN AROUND
IN THAT SKIRT AGAIN.
- IT LOOKS LIKE BED SHEETS
WRAPPED AROUND YOU,
PINNED IN THE BACK.
THE ATTENTION TO DETAIL
NEEDS TO BE JUST AS ON POINT
AS WHEN YOU COME OUT HERE
WITH A PINOCCHIO NOSE.
- ALL RIGHT.
DARIENNE LAKE.
- WELL, DARIENNE, PRETTY DRESS.
IT'S NOTHING SPECTACULAR.
- YESTERDAY,
WITH YOUR PERFORMANCE,
YOU GAVE ME, LIKE, MISSY ELLIOTT
WITH THE TRASH BAG.
I WANTED TO SEE YOU,
LIKE, BUST OUT OF IT
AND, LIKE, JUST REALLY
GIVE IT TO US,
BUT YOU WERE
A LITTLE WITHHELD.
- I THINK THE HIP-HOP
THREW YOU A LITTLE BIT.
- NEXT UP,
BIANCA DEL RIO.
- THIS IS PROBABLY THE MOST
BEAUTIFUL I'VE SEEN YOU YET.
YOUR EYE MAKEUP--
YOU DIDN'T PUT
THAT HARSH WHITE LINE.
- I DIDN'T PUT IT,
BUT I DID SNORT IT.
- AT LEAST IT WAS USED.
- THAT'S WHY
I'M ALERT, GIRL.
- YESTERDAY,
YOU WERE HILARIOUS.
- OTHER THAN
THE PIGTAILS, THOUGH,
YOU WERE GIVING ME
KIND OF URKEL.
- I DISAGREE,
BECAUSE AS B-GIRLS,
THAT WAS THE LOOK
THAT WE ROCKED.
- AND LET ME
REMIND EVERYBODY
THAT MICHELLE VISAGE
IS ALSO A RAPPER.
SHE HAD A SONG
ON THE "BODYGUARD" SOUNDTRACK.
- TRACK 9. GO ON.
- ALL RIGHT. UP NEXT,
ADORE DELANO.
- WELL, ADORE, I'M HAPPY TO SEE
THAT YOU HAVE A WAIST.
- BUT?
- BUT WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO
ABOUT THIS KIND OF
MID-SHIN LENGTH?
- BUT I HAD TO WEAR IT
BECAUSE IT WAS SEE-THROUGH,
AND I WANTED
TO SHOW MY BODY.
[LAUGHTER]
- YOU ASSASSINATED THE RAP.
YOU'RE ON RHYTHM.
YOU WERE LIKE
JUST A REAL ARTIST.
- YOUR LYRICS WERE GREAT.
YOUR ATTITUDE WAS EVERYTHING.
- YEAH, MOTHERFUCKER, YEAH.
[LAUGHTER]
- WELL, THANK YOU, LADIES.
WHILE YOU UNTUCK
IN THE FORMDECOR LOUNGE,
THE JUDGES AND I
WILL DELIBERATE.
[ENGINE REVVING]
ALL RIGHT. NOW, JUST BETWEEN
US FREAKNIKS,
WHAT DO YOU THINK,
STARTING WITH JOSLYN FOX?
- HER RUNWAY LOOK TONIGHT
WAS JUST A DISASTER.
- I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU COULD
HAVE THAT MUCH ON AND STILL--
- BE THAT NAKED?
[LAUGHTER]
I THINK SHE NAILED
THE VIDEO.
- THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME I FELT
LIKE I REALLY HEARD HER VOICE,
AND IT BOOMED THROUGH.
- ALL RIGHT.
TRINITY K. BONET.
- IN THE VIDEO,
SHE GOT HER GHETTO PASS REVOKED
FOR THAT RAP, FOR REAL.
- AND AGAIN, I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND
MUCH OF WHAT SHE WAS SAYING.
- I THINK SHE GAVE UP REALLY
BEFORE SHE STARTED.
- YEAH.
- MM-HMM.
- UP NEXT, MILK.
- I THINK MILK IS REALLY,
REALLY UNIQUE AND DIFFERENT...
AND OFF, BUT IT WORKS.
- HOWEVER, WE ASKED
TO SEE MORE FROM MILK,
AND THIS IS WHAT SHE BROUGHT
OUT HERE TONIGHT.
- DARIENNE LAKE.
- DARIENNE LOOKED LOVELY
TONIGHT ON THE RUNWAY,
BUT IN THE VIDEO, HER DELIVERY
NEEDED A LOT OF WORK.
- SHE SEEMED
VERY UNCOMFORTABLE.
SHE REALLY WASN'T
DELIVERING HER PERFORMANCE.
- BIANCA DEL RIO.
- ON THE RUNWAY,
SHE LOOKED INCREDIBLE.
- HER HIP-HOP THING
WAS HILARIOUS,
BECAUSE IT WAS
ON THE COMEDY SIDE.
- BUT IT DID GET TO BE
A LITTLE "DUDE."
- UP NEXT, ADORE DELANO.
- I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT TO SAY ANYMORE, KIDS.
EVERY TIME I SAY,
"LOOK AT THE LENGTH,"
SHE COMES OUT THE NEXT WEEK
IN THE SAME LENGTH.
- YESTERDAY, SHE CAME OUT
FROM THE VERY BEGINNING
AND JUST SLAYED IT.
- TENS ALL THE WAY--
LOOK, ATTITUDE, CHARACTER,
PERSONALITY, EVERYTHING.
- THE QUESTION IS--
- SILENCE!
I'VE MADE MY DECISION.
BRING BACK MY HOMEGIRLS.
AND, UH...
[ENGINE REVVING]
[RU PAUL LAUGHING]
WELCOME BACK, LADIES.
I'VE MADE SOME DECISIONS.
BIANCA DEL RIO...
YOU ARE SAFE.
ADORE DELANO, THIS WEEK
YOU PUSHED IT REAL GOOD.
YOU ARE THE WINNER
OF THIS WEEK'S CHALLENGE.
[APPLAUSE]
AND YOU'VE WON A COLLECTION
OF CUSTOM-MADE JEWELRY
FROM THE FOUNDRY.
- JESUS KNOWS I NEED IT.
I WON FINALLY.
I'M MOTHERFUCKING LEGIT.
- JOSLYN...
YOU'RE SAFE.
TRINITY K. BONET.
MCTKB WAS NOT A TKO.
I'M SORRY, MY DEAR,
BUT YOU ARE UP
FOR ELIMINATION.
MILK, YOUR RAP AND RUNWAY LOOK
WERE NOT MC SUPREME.
DARIENNE LAKE, YOUR PERFORMANCE
AS MC CONTROL TOP
WAS NO RAPPERS DELIGHT.
DARIENNE LAKE...
YOU ARE SAFE.
[EXHALES]
YOU MAY JOIN
THE OTHER GIRLS.
MILK, I'M SORRY, MY DEAR,
BUT YOU ARE UP FOR ELIMINATION.
TWO QUEENS
STAND BEFORE ME.
LADIES, THIS IS
YOUR LAST CHANCE
TO IMPRESS ME AND SAVE
YOURSELF FROM ELIMINATION.
THE TIME HAS COME...
[THUNDER]
FOR YOU TO LIP-SYNC
FOR YOUR LIFE!
- I'M FEELING SHOCKED.
I DIDN'T EXPECT TO BE
IN THE BOTTOM TWO,
BUT I'M GONNA
WORK IT OUT.
GOOD LUCK,
AND DON'T FUCK IT UP.
BECAUSE IT'S JUST PATHETIC
- MILK IS HIGH ENERGY.
SHE IS SO WEIRD AND SO WILD.
IT'S JUST TOTALLY MILK.
- TRINITY IS REALLY
SERVING IT UP.
WITH HER LONG-ASS WEAVE,
SHE LOOKS FUCKING
BOMB.COM.ORG.CO.UK.
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
- LADIES, I'VE MADE
MY DECISION.
TRINITY K. BONET...
SHANTE, YOU STAY.
[CLAPPING]
MY DEAR MILK,
YOU'VE CONSISTENTLY SHOWN US
THAT YOU CAN THINK
OUTSIDE THE CARTON.
- I JUST WANT TO
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR ALLOWING ME
TO BE WHO I AM
WITHOUT FEAR
OF BEING RIDICULED.
THANK YOU.
- IN MY HEART,
IT WILL ALWAYS BE
MILKIN' TIME.
NOW SASHAY AWAY.
[APPLAUSE]
[CHUCKLING]
- I WANTED TO LEAVE
MY STAMP,
AND I REALLY THINK I DID.
I'M SO HAPPY WITH WHAT
I'VE SHOWN THE WORLD,
AND I'M EXCITED
TO KEEP GOING
AND FOR PEOPLE TO LOVE MY DRAG
AS MUCH AS I DO.
CAN I GET MY PHONE BACK?
HA HA HA.
- MY CRAZY 8 QUEENS...
CONDRAGULATIONS.
NOW REMEMBER,
IF YOU CAN'T LOVE YOURSELF,
HOW IN THE HELL ARE YOU
GONNA LOVE SOMEBODY ELSE?
CAN I GET
AN "AMEN" IN HERE?
- AMEN!
- ALL RIGHT.
NOW LET THE MUSIC PLAY.
[MUSIC PLAYING]


- PREVIOUSLY ON
"RuPAUL'S DRAG RACE"...
YOU'LL BE HOSTING YOUR
VERY OWN TALK SHOW.
- I AM ONE DEGREE OF
SEPARATION FROM CHER!
- WERE YOU, LIKE, THE
BIG CHILDHOOD STAR?
- NO, HONEY, WE WERE BROKE, AND
IT WAS DURING THE DEPRESSION.
- OH!
- WE HAD NO MONEY.
- I LOVE IT.
- AND THERE WAS NO FOOD.
- THAT'S SO COOL.
- OH, MY GOD.
WELL, CHAD, UM...
- TRINITY
KEPT CALLING ME CHAD.
- CHAD.
- COURTNEY ACT,
CONDRAGULATIONS, YOU ARE
THE WINNER OF THIS
WEEK'S CHALLENGE.
[APPLAUSE]
- ADORE DELANO,
SHANTE, YOU STAY.
TRINITY K. BONET,
SASHAY AWAY.
[CAWING]
- OH.
- OH, SHUT UP.
- GIRL, SHUT UP.
- AW, "BE COOL.
BE NICE. BE YOU."
AW.
- I'M FEELING SO MANY
EMOTIONS RIGHT NOW.
I'M DISAPPOINTED.
I'M ANGRY AT MYSELF.
I NEED TO JUST SHAKE IT
OFF AT THIS POINT.
- CONGRATULATIONS, MISS ACT.
- CONGRATULATIONS
ON WINNING.
- THANK YOU.
I WANT TO HAVE A TALK SHOW
WHEN I GROW UP, SO I'LL LET
YOU BE MY MICHELLE VISAGE.
- HA HA! MY TITTIES
AREN'T BIG ENOUGH.
- IT FEELS GREAT TO KNOW THAT
THE JUDGES ARE FEELING ME
IN THE WAY THAT I
WAS WANTING THEM TO,
AND I DO SENSE MYSELF GETTING
A TEENY BIT MORE COMPETITIVE.
I CAN SMELL THE
$100,000 FROM HERE.
NOW THERE'S ONLY TWO OF US
WHO HAVEN'T LIPPED-SANG.
IT'S JUST YOU AND ME, BIANCA.
- OH, MY GOD,
YOU GUYS SHOULD
TOTALLY LIP-SYNC AGAINST
EACH OTHER NEXT WEEK.
- HOW ABOUT NEXT WEEK, WE HAVE
A DANCE CHALLENGE, AND THEN
BIANCA CAN LIP-SYNC, AND
I'LL JUST BE THE ONE LEFT
WHO HASN'T LIP-SYNCHED.
- OH, OH, OH. ARE THESE THREATS
YOU'RE MAKING, LITTLE EVA PERON
WHO LOOKS LIKE A SAD BIRD?
YOU FUCKIN' BITCH.
- I THINK COURTNEY CAN
SOMETIMES COME ACROSS AS
UNLIKABLE OR GRAND.
SHE PROBABLY SHOULDN'T BE
A BLONDE EVERY TIME
SHE'S OUT THERE.
SHE PROBABLY SHOULDN'T LOOK
SO NAKED ALL THE TIME.
IT DOES GET A
LITTLE MONOTONOUS.
THEY WANT TO SEE VERSATILITY.
WE ALL KNOW SHE'S PRETTY.
GIVE US SOMETHING ELSE.
- GO BACK TO AUSTRALIA.
- THE WINNER OF "RuPAUL'S DRAG
RACE" RECEIVES A SICKENING
SUPPLY OF COLOREVOLUTION
COSMETICS AND A CASH PRIZE
OF $100,000,
WITH EXTRA-SPECIAL GUEST
JUDGES, DAVID BURTKA AND
NEIL PATRICK HARRIS.
[TIRE SCREECHES]
- [SINGING]
- WESTSIDE.
- THERE ARE 6 OF US.
- YAY!
- IT'S THE TOP 6.
ANY LITTLE SLIP CAN TAKE
YOU OUT OF THIS GAME.
I'LL BE LEAVING BANANA
PEELS EVERYWHERE.
- SO WHAT'S NEXT?
- MAYBE WE HAVE TO DO MAGIC.
- I WAS A GLAMOROUS ASSISTANT
ONCE, AND WHEN I WAS SQUEEZED
IN THE BACK OF THE LITTLE BOX,
I WAS IN SUCH A CONTORTED
POSITION THAT MY RIGHT
TESTICLE POPPED OUT ENTIRELY.
- WHY DO YOU HAVE
A RAT TESTICLE?
- MY RIGHT TESTICLE.
[SIREN WAILS]
- OH, THANK GOD!
- OOH, GIRL.
- DEARLY BELOVED, WE ARE
GATHERED HERE IN THE PRESENCE
OF YES, GOD.
- SAY I DO, AND I JUST MIGHT
PRONOUNCE YOU AMERICA'S NEXT
DRAG SUPERSTAR.
YOU MAY NOW KISS THE
MOTHER-TUCKING BRIDE.
- UH-OH.
- HELLO, HELLO, HELLO.
- HI.
- ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
FOR TODAY'S MINI CHALLENGE,
I'M COMMISSIONING YOU TO CREATE
A SERIES OF ABSTRACT PAINTINGS
IN HONOR OF
MARRIAGE EQUALITY.
I'M CALLING THIS COLLECTION
"EVERYBODY SAY LOVE."
- LOVE.
[BARKING]
- YOU'LL NEED TO PAD
OUT THESE BODYSUITS.
THEN EACH OF YOU NEEDS TO
BODY PAINT A TWERK OF ART.
SHAKE YOUR PICASSO.
- OOH,
SHAKE MY MONET-MAKER.
- ON YOUR MARK,
GET SET, VAN GOGH!
- OW!
- JOSLYN, DO YOU HAVE
8 BIKINIS I CAN BORROW?
- OW!
- WHOO!
- ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
- YES.
- OH, MY GOD. THAT IS
GEORGIA O'QUEEF.
- ALL RIGHT, ARTISTS,
TELL ME ABOUT
YOUR TWERKS OF ART.
LET'S START WITH JOSLYN.
- THERE'S A HEART HERE, AND
IT HAS SUNGLASSES ON LIKE ME
'CAUSE LOVE'S BLIND.
LOVE.
- BUT DOES IT MATCH MY COUCH?
- THIS PIECE IS CALLED
"IT'S ALWAYS DARKEST
BEFORE THE DAWN."
- OOH. ANDY WHORE-HOL.
OH.
- I STARTED OFF WITH A BEAUTIFUL
EQUALITY EQUALS SIGN
AND STARTED WHIPPING IT
WITH MY HAIR.
- VERY LADY GAGA.
- IT'S CHAOS.
- I BROUGHT AN ANGEL THROUGH
LOVE, BRING HAPPY LITTLE TREES
AND BIRDS AND BEES.
- GORGEOUS.
- YOU'RE LOOKING AT
IT UPSIDE-DOWN.
- OH, OH, OK.
I SEE IT NOW!
- THESE PURPLE COLUMNS--ONE
IS GOVERNMENT, ONE IS SOCIETY,
AND THROUGH THAT, THE HEART
IS GROWING AND BECOMING WHOLE.
- VERY TYRA BANKS-Y.
- MY TWERK OF ART REPRESENTS
THE MAN AND THE WOMAN COMING
TOGETHER TO FORM
ONE BEAUTIFUL BODY.
- I DON'T SEE IT.
- YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE
GOING TO A SPORTS GAME.
- STOP RELYING ON
THAT BOTTICELLI.
WELL, NICE WORK, LADIES.
THE WINNER OF TODAY'S
MINI-CHALLENGE IS...
BIANCA DEL RIO.
- OH!
- CONDRAGULATIONS.
- MY KID COULD HAVE DONE THAT.
- SHUT UP.
- ALL RIGHT, LADIES, CLEAN UP,
'CAUSE WE GOT COMPANY COMING.
- UH-OH.
- LET'S GO.
- CAN THIS THING
GO ANY FASTER?
THIS WEEK, LADIES, LOVE IS
IN THE AIR, AND I WANT YOU TO
MEET SOME TRULY SPECIAL WOMEN.
- OH.
- NOW,
TOMORROW I'LL HAVE THE HONOR
OF MARRYING THESE LADIES ON
THE MAIN STAGE, BECAUSE, YES,
MAMA Ru IS AN ORDAINED
MINISTER, Y'ALL.
WHOO! WHOO!
- ALL RIGHT, LADIES.
I WANT YOU TO MEET ANNA,
EDDIE, BRITTANY, AMY D., DAWN,
AND AMY S.
- I CLICK.
THIS IS THE MAKEOVER
CHALLENGE.
I'M INSTANTLY KIND OF GOING
UP AND DOWN THE LINE WONDERING
WHO'S GONNA BE THE BEST BRIDE.
- NOW, BIANCA, YOU WON
THE MINI-CHALLENGE,
SO YOU GET TO PAIR UP
THE QUEENS WITH THE LADIES.
- I'M GONNA HAVE TO TAKE
MS. BRITTANY AND
GIVE HER TO JOSLYN,
'CAUSE SHE
LIKES HER ACCESSORIES.
[LAUGHTER]
- HI, BRITTANY.
- I THINK I WANT MISS EDDIE.
COME THIS WAY.
- GREAT. HEY!
- SHE SEEMS SASSY.
AMY, YOU SEEM LIKE YOU
WOULD DO WELL WITH ADORE.
- HI.
- YOU SEEM LIKE
A COURTNEY TYPE.
- OK.
- BLONDE.
- NICE TO MEET YOU.
- ANNA,
THIS IS DARIENNE.
- OH, HI!
- AMY,
THIS IS BENDELA.
- HI, AMY.
- NOW, LADIES,
WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING
FOR A STRONG FAMILY
RESEMBLANCE.
YOU'LL USE MATERIALS
FROM FABRIC PLANET
AND YOUR OWN DRAG.
AS DRAG MOTHERS OF THE BRIDE,
I WANT YOU TO USE YOUR
CHARISMA, UNIQUENESS, NERVE,
AND TALENT TO MAKE THEIR WEDDING
THE MOST IMPORTANT DAY
OF THEIR LIFE, BUT TO DO THAT,
FIRST YOU NEED TO
MEET THE GROOMS.
WELCOME, GENTLEMEN.
NOW, FOR THIS WEEK'S MAIN
CHALLENGE, YOU WON'T BE MAKING
OVER THESE WOMEN.
NO, NO, THAT'D BE TOO EASY.
INSTEAD, YOU'LL USE THE MAGIC
OF DRAG TO TRANSFORM THESE
GALLANT GROOMS INTO
BLUSHING BRIDES.
IT'S A NICE DAY FOR
A DRAG WEDDING.
[LAUGHTER]
- GENTLEMEN, START YOUR
ENGINES, AND MAY THE BEST
WOMAN WIN.
- I DON'T DO PEOPLE'S MAKEUP.
I DON'T SEW.
I'M JUST GONNA FUCKIN' SIT ON
A CONE AND WAIT FOR A TRUCK TO
HIT ME AT THIS POINT.
I SWEAR TO GOD.
I'M OVER IT.
- OH, NO!
- COMING UP...
- IS IT GONNA HANG
LIKE A BIG ROBE LIKE THAT?
- COURTNEY'S PUTTING HER
BRIDE IN A BATH MAT MUUMUU.
- I THINK I MIGHT NEED A VEIL.
- NO, YOU WON'T.
I'LL BEAT YOUR FACE.
- YOU'RE GONNA BEAT MY FACE?
[ENGINE REVS]
[ENGINE REVS]
- OUR CHALLENGE TODAY IS TO
TURN STRAIGHT GROOMS INTO
BLUSHING BRIDES.
THE KEY TO BRIDAL WEAR IS
MAKING SURE THE BRIDE IS HAPPY,
SO THE FIRST THING WE DO IS
SIT DOWN WITH OUR COUPLES
AND FIND OUT WHAT THEY'D
LIKE FOR THEIR WEDDING.
ALL RIGHT, HOW DO
WE FEEL ABOUT MAKEUP?
ARE WE THINKING A SOFT
EYE AND A BRIGHT LIP?
OR ARE WE THINKING
A DOMINANT EYE?
- I THINK A DOMINANT EYE
AND A DOMINANT LIP.
- OH, YOU ARE MY KIND
OF GIRL, EDDIE!
- YES.
- THIS IS GONNA BE FUN.
I'M SO EXCITED ABOUT
THIS CHALLENGE.
I'M CURRENTLY ENGAGED,
AND I LOVE EVERYTHING WEDDING.
THIS IS JUST
RIGHT UP MY ALLEY.
OK, SO DO YOU HAVE
ANY KIND OF VISION?
- I CAN SEE A
FLORULENT PRINCESS LOOK.
- YOU'RE GONNA LOOK SO PURTY.
- PRETTY.
[LAUGHS, SNORTS]
- WE CAN GIVE YOU SOME PADDING,
TOO, SO YOU CAN HAVE SOME WIDER
HIPS SO YOU'LL HAVE SOME BODY.
- OH, MAN, I DON'T KNOW
IF I WANT BODY.
- AREN'T YOU GETTING EXCITED?
I DON'T THINK BRANDON HAS
ANY IDEA WHAT HE SIGNED
HIMSELF UP FOR.
- HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT SHAVING?
- I'M OK WITH THAT.
- YEAH?
- WE CAN WORK
WITH IT, YEAH.
- OK, COOL.
- I'VE NEVER SEEN KEVIN
WITHOUT A BEARD, SO I'M
A LITTLE NERVOUS ABOUT THAT.
- WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU
SAW YOURSELF WITHOUT A BEARD?
- 6 YEARS.
- THE MOST WORRISOME THING
ABOUT THE BEARD IS NOT KNOWING
WHAT'S UNDER THERE.
IT COULD BE ANYTHING.
- SO WHAT ARE YOU THINKING
ABOUT FOR THIS WEDDING?
- I WOULD LIKE TO DO
SOMETHING, LIKE,
MORE GOTHY AND COOL.
YOU KNOW, ROCK AND ROLL,
HORROR, AND NOT TRADITIONAL.
- HE NEEDS TO LOOK FIERCE,
LIKE SHARON AND DETOX.
- OK, SHARON AND DETOX,
SORT OF?
- YEAH.
- SO, GOTH?
THE MATERIALS SUPPLIED ARE
WHITE, SILVER--NOT GOTH.
AAAH!
- YOU'RE QUITE A TALL,
SOLID MAN.
MY ONLY WEAKNESS IS, YOU DON'T
HAPPEN TO BE A TAILOR, DO YOU?
YOU WEREN'T A TAILOR IN
THE ARMY, WERE YOU? NO.
- IF YOU HAVE ANY BOMBS LAYING
AROUND, I CAN DISARM THEM.
- COURTNEY MIGHT HAVE A LOT
MORE TROUBLE TRANSFORMING
A MANLY MAN, BECAUSE COURTNEY
ONLY WEARS CHAPSTICK
AND MASCARA.
- I THINK I MIGHT NEED A VEIL.
- NO, YOU WON'T.
I'LL BEAT YOUR FACE.
IT'LL BE HOT.
- YOU'RE GONNA BEAT MY FACE?
- YEAH, THAT'S WHAT WE SAY.
"OH, SHE'S BEATING HER FACE"
MEANS THAT SHE'S DOING,
LIKE, A GOOD JOB
ON DOING HER MAKEUP.
- OK.
- YEAH, IT'S LINGO.
- OH!
- "I'M GONNA
BEAT YOUR FACE"--
IT MEANS SOMETHING
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.
- OH, NO!
I CAN DO YOUR FACE, BUT
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SEW.
- LIKE,
I ENVISION MY WEDDING,
LIKE, VERA WANG WITH, LIKE,
A NICE POOFY DRESS,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
IT'S, LIKE, VERY ELEGANT.
- ELEGANT?
I'M NOT SURE IF SHE HEARD
ME WHEN I SAID I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO SEW.
- ATTENTION, WOMEN.
IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO BE
FITTED FOR YOUR SUITS FROM
HER TUXEDO.
SO KISS YOUR FELLAS, AND
SAY GOOD-BYE FOR NOW.
- I LOVE YOU.
- DON'T FUCK IT UP.
- LET'S GO GET SOME MATERIALS.
- OK.
- OH!
- HOW AM I WALK
IN THESE THINGS?
- POP YOUR HEAD THROUGH THERE.
AND THEN THIS ONE DOESN'T
QUITE HAVE A SLEEVE YET.
- OK, SO WE'LL JUST
PUT IT THROUGH
LIKE A LITTLE--LIKE
A MONK ROBE.
- YEAH.
- COURTNEY'S PUTTING HER
BRIDE IN A BATH MAT MUUMUU.
- IS IT GONNA HANG LIKE A
BIG ROBE LIKE THAT?
- I THINK COURTNEY HAS A
REALLY DIFFICULT CHALLENGE
BECAUSE SHE'S USED TO DESIGNER
GOWNS MADE FOR HER THAT
ARE...(HIGH-PITCHED) THIS BIG.
(HIGH-PITCHED) HOW
ABOUT FOR THIS BIG?
NO.
- WELL, JUST SO
YOU KNOW, I'M NOT
GONNA HIT ON YOU, BECAUSE
I'M NOT REALLY RECRUITING.
THERE'S ENOUGH GAYS IN THIS
WORLD, SO...AND NOW THAT THEY
CAN GET MARRIED, YOU KNOW,
IT'S ONLY GONNA BE A MESS.
- I'M FROM HOLLAND, THE MOST
LIBERAL COUNTRY PROBABLY
IN THE WORLD, AND IT'S
VERY NORMAL FOR, YOU KNOW,
GAY COUPLES BE MARRIED.
- IN HOLLAND?
- OH, YEAH,
ABSOLUTELY. YOU KNOW.
- THAT'S NICE TO KNOW.
SEEMS TO BE A LITTLE SLOW
HERE, BUT LUCKILY ALL THIS
IS CHANGING.
- YEAH, PEOPLE ARE FREE TO DO
WHAT THEY WANT, YOU KNOW?
- OH, TOTALLY.
IT'S REALLY REFRESHING TO HANG
AROUND SOMEONE WHO'S STRAIGHT
WITHOUT ANY HANG-UPS.
I'M REALIZING I
REALLY LIKE THIS GUY.
- IT'S ALMOST LIKE
GIVING SOMEONE A HAIRCUT.
- VERY MUCH SO.
LOOK, I ACTUALLY MADE
A FRIEND TODAY.
ME. FRIEND.
- HELLO, HELLO, HELLO.
- HI.
- HEY.
- LET'S GET THIS
BRIDAL PARTY STARTED.
- YAY.
- HI, JOSLYN.
- HEY, Ru-SIE Q.
- HI, BRANDON.
- HELLO.
- I KNOW YOU'RE A
BASKETBALL PLAYER.
- YES.
- TELL ME THIS.
WHAT WILL YOUR TEAMMATES
SAY WHEN THEY SEE YOU
ALL UP IN DRAG?
- DEVASTATING.
I DON'T WANT TO
THINK ABOUT IT.
- YOU DON'T WANT TO
THINK ABOUT IT?
- NOT RIGHT NOW.
- NOW, YOU'VE STRUGGLED
ON THE RUNWAY WITH THE
JUDGES' CRITIQUES.
THEY'VE QUESTIONED
YOUR STYLE SENSE.
IT TENDS TO BE FROM THE
HOOCHIE COUTURE LINE.
- YES, 9 BIKINIS.
- HOW ARE YOU GONNA ENSURE
THAT YOU DON'T WIND UP
IN THE BOTTOM AGAIN?
- WELL, THIS I'M
MAKING MYSELF.
WE'RE GOING FOR DEMURE.
- WHAT--EX-SQUEEZE ME?
- UH-HUH.
- YOU MEAN YOUR BUTT
IS GONNA BE COVERED?
- MY BUTT IS GOING
TO BE COVERED.
- HOW ON EARTH WILL
WE RECOGNIZE YOU?
- I'M KEEPING IT, YOU KNOW,
IN MY STYLE, BUT DEFINITELY
MORE SOPHISTICATED
AND POLISHED.
- YOU GONNA KEEP IT FOXY?
(BOTH MAKING
HONKING SOUNDS)
- ALL RIGHT,
GET BACK TO WORK.
- THANKS, Ru-SIE Q.
- WELL, HELLO, DARIENNE.
HI, DAMON.
- HEY, Ru.
- SO IT WAS YOUR WIFE'S IDEA
TO HAVE YOU COME ON "DRAG RACE"?
- IT WAS MY IDEA, ACTUALLY.
- IT WAS YOUR IDEA?
- YEAH.
- HOW ABOUT THAT?
SO NOW, UM, SOMETHING
TELLS ME THIS IS
NOT GOING TO BE
A WHITE WEDDING.
- ABSOLUTELY NOT.
- I THINK WE'RE TALKING,
LIKE, HORROR BOMBSHELL.
- YEAH,
AND WE'RE GONNA BE SORT
OF THE ADDAMS FAMILY,
IF YOU WILL.
- HUH.
- IF JIM MORRISON WAS GONNA BE
A DRAG QUEEN, IT WOULD BE ME.
- YEAH, YEAH.
ALL RIGHT, WELL, LISTEN,
I'M GONNA LET YOU KIDS
GET BACK TO WORK, OK?
ALL RIGHT.
HEY, ALEX.
HEY, BIANCA.
- HEY, HEY, HEY.
- WOW,
LOOK IT THERE.
THAT FABRIC IS
REALLY GORGEOUS.
- WE ARE GIVING
CLASSIC LADY LOOK.
- WHAT WILL BIANCA'S
BRIDE BE WEARING?
(GASPS) A BOATNECK GOWN.
I MEAN,
IT'S AMAZING,
BUT WE'VE SEEN IT.
- WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
TO FEMINIZE THE FACE?
- WELL, I'M GONNA ASK
EVERYONE TO STEP BACK,
WHICH IS GONNA HELP...
A LOT.
YOU KNOW, JUST--JUST KEEP
SOME DISTANCE FROM THE BRIDE.
- I WILL SEE YOU OUT THERE.
- ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU, Ru.
- THANKS, Ru.
- ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
GATHER AROUND.
NOW, AS A THANK-YOU TO ALL
THE MAN BRIDES, I'M GIVING YOU
GIFT CERTIFICATES FROM KLEIN,
EPSTEIN, AND PARKER, THE FINE
MAKERS OF MY SUITS.
- WOW, THANK YOU.
- AND TOMORROW FOR YOUR
BIG DAY, GOOD LUCK,
AND DON'T FUCK IT UP.
- I HATE IT.
I NEED TO MAKE A SKIRT.
I JUST DON'T KNOW
HOW TO DO IT.
- OK, SO NOW YOU'RE TRYING TO
PUT AN OVERSKIRT, RIGHT?
WELL, PIN IT ON THERE FIRST
AND SEE HOW IT LOOKS.
- LIKE THAT?
- YEAH.
- HA HA HA HA!
- WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO DO?
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE IT
OPEN ON THE SIDE?
I'M ASKING.
- I DON'T KNOW.
OH, MY GOD.
- I JUST DON'T WANT
TO DISAPPOINT Ru.
I'M NOT A SEAMSTRESS.
I'M NOT FUCKING CINDERELLA.
I DON'T HAVE MICE TO COME HELP
ME MAKE THIS DAMN GARMENT.
- JUST START GLUING UP HERE
AND START CUTTING THE BOTTOM.
- YEAH.
- COMING UP...
- WOW, THAT LOOKS LIKE
A THRIFT STORE WIG.
- SEEING ADORE AND HER
DAUGHTER IS MAKING ME
FEEL REALLY CONFIDENT.
- FUCK YOU.
[ENGINE REVS]
[ENGINE REVS]
- OH, MY, THERE'S SO MUCH TO
DO FOR THIS WEDDING.
OUR CHALLENGE TODAY IS TO
TRANSFORM HETEROSEXUAL GROOMS
INTO BLUSHING BRIDES.
- DO YOU FEEL LIKE A PRINCESS?
- I GUESS.
- WOW, THAT LOOKS LIKE
A THRIFT STORE WIG.
[SIGHS]
- WOW, I LOOK
LIKE JOEY RAMONE.
- I DON'T KNOW IF I'M
A BLACK-HAIRED GIRL.
- OH, MY GOD.
- ADORE, YOUR DRAG DAUGHTER'S
GOT YOUR NATURAL HOG BODY.
THAT'S A COMPLIMENT.
- FUCK YOU.
- SEEING ADORE AND HER
DAUGHTER IS MAKING ME FEEL
REALLY CONFIDENT.
- WITH THAT FUCKIN'
HONEY MAHOGANY DRESS?
- BETTER THAN A
HONEY MA-HOG BODY.
- OOH!
- ADORE'S GUY IS A
LITTLE ALL OVER THE SHOP.
WELL, IT DOESN'T REALLY
MATTER, 'CAUSE HE'S
WITH ADORE, SO IT'S GONNA
BE A DISASTER ANYWAY.
- YOU PUT THIS STUFF
ON ALL THE TIME?
- MM-HMM.
- WOW.
- BRANDON IS A PROFESSIONAL
ATHLETE, AND GETTING INTO DRAG--
IT'S A HUGE LEAP FOR HIM.
- AM I GONNA BE SURPRISED
WHEN I LOOK IN THE MIRROR?
- MM-HMM. YOU'RE
GONNA BE SO PRETTY.
THE SECOND I PUT MAKEUP
ON BRANDON'S FACE,
HE IS NOT HAVING IT.
- I JUST DON'T--MAN, I DON'T
WANT MY TEAMMATES TO SEE ME
WITH HIPS ON.
- WHAT DO YOU REALLY THINK
YOUR TEAMMATES ARE GONNA SAY
WHEN THEY SEE YOU IN DRAG?
- OH, MAN, IT'LL BE POSTED
ALL OVER FACEBOOK.
YOU KNOW, THE LOCKER ROOM CHAT
THAT WE HAVE--IT'S GONNA BE
A DISASTER, MAN.
LIKE, IT'S JUST GONNA BE
SOME SERIOUS QUESTIONING.
- YOU JUST GOT TO BE SECURE
WITH YOURSELF, BRANDON.
- NO, I'M VERY SECURE
WITH MYSELF.
I JUST--IN MY PROFESSION,
IT'S NOT FUNNY FOR
A GAY PERSON TO,
YOU KNOW, COME IN
THE LOCKER ROOM.
I'D RATHER SOMEONE BE
STRAIGHTFORWARD AND SAY,
YOU KNOW, "I'M GAY,"
YOU KNOW, IF THEY'RE IN
THE LOCKER ROOM WITH ME.
I DON'T WANT THEM, LIKE,
CHECKING ME OUT EITHER.
- IF YOUR INTENT IS THAT A GAY
MAN IN A LOCKER ROOM SHOULD BE
OPEN AS GAY BECAUSE EVERYBODY
SHOULD BE ABLE TO EXPRESS
THEIR SEXUALITY FREELY,
THEN THAT WORKS FOR ME,
BUT IF IT'S, "I WANT HIM
TO LET ME KNOW I'M GAY
SO THAT I KNOW
THAT HE'S NOT
LOOKING AT ME,"
OR "I FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE
BECAUSE OF THAT," THEN I
FEEL LIKE THE INTENT'S
A BIT DIFFERENT.
DOESN'T ENTIRELY
MAKE SENSE TO ME.
- I GET YOUR CONCERNS,
BUT I THINK WHAT YOU'RE DOING
IS GONNA CHANGE PEOPLE'S
MINDS, ESPECIALLY
YOUR TEAMMATES.
- YOU THINK SO?
- I KNOW SO.
- I'M SO EXCITED.
- I'M EXCITED, TOO.
I REALLY AM.
- I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE MY
LITTLE GIRL'S GROWING UP.
- OH, SHUT UP.
- HE'S TALKING
SHIT ABOUT YOU.
- WHAT? WHO'S TALKING
SHIT ABOUT ME?
- FUCKIN' ADORE'S
DAUGHTER--HOG BODY.
- DON'T BLAME ME, DELANO.
- HOG BODY DELANO HAS
SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT
MADAME DELACREME?
- SHE'S GOT A LOT TO SAY.
- WELL, LET'S HEAR
WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY
WHEN YOU MAKE YOUR
DAUGHTER LOSE THE
CHALLENGE, HOG BODY.
[ALL GASP]
- THEY'RE GONNA LAUGH AT YOU.
THEY'RE ALL GONNA
LAUGH AT YOU.
STAY HOME WITH ME AND PRAY.
- YOU LOOK REAL PRETTY.
- AFTER THE MAKEOVER, JOSLYN'S
DRAG DAUGHTER--HE LOOKED LIKE
THAT ONE GIRL GREMLIN.
- REMEMBER THAT ONE GIRL
GREMLIN IN THE MOVIE?
DON'T THROW WATER ON
THAT GREMLIN 'CAUSE HE
WILL MULTIPLY.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
[RuPAUL LAUGHING]
[APPLAUSE]
- WELCOME TO THE MAIN STAGE
OF "RuPAUL'S DRAG RACE."
WHAT'S A WEDDING WITHOUT MY
WIFE IN A DIFFERENT LIFE,
MICHELLE VISAGE?
- I DO.
- AND SANTINO RICE.
- ALWAYS AND FOREVER.
- AND WELCOME OUR HANDSOME
AND TALENTED SUPER COUPLE,
ACTOR DAVID BURTKA...
- YOU ARE SPARKLING AS EVER.
- OH, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
I FEEL LIKE CHAMPAGNE
OR AT LEAST CHAMPALE.
- AND STAR OF "HOW I MET
YOUR MOTHER" AND THE CURRENT
BROADWAY PRODUCTION OF
"HEDWIG AND THE ANGRY INCH,"
NEIL PATRICK HARRIS.
- NO ONE DOES IT
BETTER THAN YOU, Ru.
- SO EXCITED YOU'RE HERE.
- WE'RE DIE-HARD
FANS OF THE SHOW.
WE WATCH EVERY SEASON.
- NOW, DAVID, YOU TWO HAVE
BEEN TOGETHER FOR 10 YEARS.
WHAT'S THE SECRET TO
YOUR RELATIONSHIP?
- OH, WELL, UM,
NEVER GO TO BED ANGRY.
- YEAH, I HAVEN'T
SLEPT FOR 6 MONTHS.
- (LAUGHS) THIS WEEK,
WE CHALLENGED OUR QUEENS TO
TRANSFORM GRUFF GROOMS
INTO BEAUTIFUL BRIDES.
ARE YOU READY TO WITNESS THE
DRAG WEDDING OF THE CENTURY?
- READY, RU.
- OH, YEAH.
- HOLLA.
- GENTLEMEN, START YOUR
ENGINES, AND MAY
THE BEST WOMAN WIN.
- COMING UP...
- IT'S ALL JUST
A LITTLE BIT OF A MESS.
- I DIDN'T GET THE GOTH THING.
- BITCH, YOU'RE GOING HOME.
[ENGINE REVS]
[ENGINE REVS]
- NOW, SISSY THAT WEDDING.
["HERE COMES THE BRIDE"
PLAYING]
- HERE COMES THE BRIDE.
- WOW.
- MY DRAG DAUGHTER IS GLOWING
IN HER BIG, FRILLY WHITE DRESS.
WE ARE ONE FOXY LITTLE PAIR.
SHE CERTAINLY TAKES
AFTER HER MOTHER.
- YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.
- OH, MY GOSH!
- MY DAUGHTER IS
A GLOWING BRIDE.
WE'RE KIND OF BEING BRIGHT AND
LIVELY, SUNNY SOUTHERN BELLES.
MY HAIR IS HIGH AND CLOSE TO
GOD, AND I'M GIVING AWAY MY
DAUGHTER ON HER SPECIAL DAY.
- MY GOD. YOU LOOK
BEAUTIFUL.
- AW.
- OH, MY GOSH!
- MY DAUGHTER AND I ARE A
VISION IN YELLOW AND WHITE.
WE ARE GIVING MOTHER-DAUGHTER
DRAG REALNESS.
[PRETENDS TO CRY]
[LAUGHTER]
- HELLO, MY DARLING.
- OH, MY GOD. I DON'T
RECOGNIZE YOU AT ALL.
- MY BRIDE IS SORT OF
NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS.
AND SHE'S TERRIFIED THAT HER
BOUQUET IS WHITE, SO I WHIP OUT
A CAN OF SPRAY PAINT
AND SPRAY THAT SUCKER BLACK,
LIKE MY HEART.
- YOU LOOK AMAZING.
- MY DAUGHTER IS A REBEL.
SHE SKIPPED SCHOOL TO ELOPE,
AND SHE BORROWED MOM'S OLD
LEATHER JACKET.
SHE LOOKS LIKE CHUCKY'S
BRIDE, SO IT'S A PARTY.
- YOU'RE SO TALL.
- MY DAUGHTER LOOKS BEAUTIFUL.
I'M SO PROUD OF HER.
I'M HAPPY WITH THE LITTLE WALK
WE CAME UP WITH, AND I'M JUST
HAVING A FUN TIME SORT OF
PLAYING THE MOTHER AND FUSSING
WITH HIM, MAKING SURE HIS
SKIRT'S STRAIGHT, MAKING SURE
HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY
LIPSTICK ON HIS TEETH.
- OOH.
LIKE A VIRGIN.
[SOBBING]
[LAUGHTER]
- DEARLY BELOVED, WE ARE
GATHERED HERE TODAY TO
CELEBRATE THE JOINING
TOGETHER OF SOULS.
LET THIS JOYOUS OCCASION
REMIND US ALL THAT WE ARE BORN
NAKED AND THE REST IS LOVE.
- AMEN.
- OUR GORGEOUS COUPLES HAVE
WRITTEN THEIR OWN VOWS.
- BRITTANY, I
LOVE YOU, GIRL.
I LOOK FORWARD TO MANY MORE
YEARS THAT WE WILL SHARE
TOGETHER, AND I JUST LOVE YOU.
- BRADONNA, I'M THE
LUCKIEST MAN IN THE WORLD.
I VOW TO BE YOUR NEVER-ENDING
FOUNDATION OF LOVE
AND SUPPORT, AND NO MAN OR
WOMAN SHALL TEAR US APART.
- DAWN,
YOU ALWAYS WERE AND ALWAYS
WILL BE THE LOVE OF MY LIFE,
MY BEAUTIFUL QUEEN.
YOU'RE MY WORLD,
AND I LOVE YOU.
(WHISPERS) DON'T CRY.
(WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY)
- YOU ARE MY WORLD.
YOU'RE MY HERO,
MY SOUL MATE.
I ADORE YOU, YOU BIG
BEAUTIFUL DRAG QUEEN.
- AS A BRIDE TODAY, I DO
HAVE CERTAIN EXPECTATIONS.
FIRST OF ALL, I'D LIKE SOME
MORE SPACE IN THE WARDROBE.
I'D LIKE A BIWEEKLY
MANICURE AND PEDICURE.
AND LAST, BUT CERTAINLY NOT
LEAST, I'D LIKE TO SCHEDULE
ADDITIONAL BEDROOM TIME.
- OK.
I LOVE YOU VERY MUCH AND
LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING ON
WITH YOU, MY BEAUTIFUL BRIDE.
FABULOUS.
- 35 YEARS AGO, I MET
YOU AT WONDERLAND.
I FELL IN LOVE
WITH YOU INSTANTLY.
BAM!
- WE'VE ROLLED THROUGH
THE PUNCHES LIKE WATER OFF
A DUCK'S BACK, AND WE WEREN'T
AFRAID TO SCREAM OUT, "WHERE
MY PEOPLE AT?"
- IF I'VE HAD IT OFFICIALLY,
AND YOU SEE ME FROWN,
JUST DRAG IT UP AND PUT
ON THAT SEQUINS GOWN.
- HALLELU!
- AMY, I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.
YOU'RE A BEAUTIFUL PERSON
IN EVERY POSSIBLE WAY.
YOU MAKE MY LIFE HAPPY,
MEANINGFUL, AND COMPLETE.
I LOVE YOU
FIERCELY AND FOREVER.
- I LOVE HOW WE GROW TOGETHER,
HOW YOU MAKE ME LAUGH, AND HOW
WE WANT TO CHANGE
THE WORLD TOGETHER.
I PROMISE TO LOVE YOU,
TO BE YOUR FAITHFUL,
SUPPORTIVE PARTNER IN
SICKENINGNESS AND IN HEALTH.
I LOVE YOU
FIERCELY AND FOREVER.
- I BELIEVE EVERY LIVING
CREATURE IN THE UNIVERSE
DESERVES THE RIGHT TO
LOVE AND TO BE HAPPY.
THROUGH MY LIPSTICK AND
MY LASHES, THERE'S A HEART
IN HERE, AND THIS HEART
ABSOLUTELY ADORES YOU.
- I WAITED FOR 35 YEARS
TO MEET MY SOUL MATE.
IT WAS LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT.
A FEW DAYS INTO OUR
RELATIONSHIP, MY LEGS WENT OUT,
AND I WAS IN A
WHEELCHAIR, AND INSTEAD
OF LEAVING ME,
YOU STUCK BY ME.
FOR RICHER, FOR POORER,
FOR SICKNESS AND IN HEALTH,
I LOVE YOU FOREVER.
- WOULD YOU NOW
EXCHANGE RINGS?
DO YOU PROMISE TO LOVE,
CHERISH, AND HONOR EACH OTHER
FOR BETTER OR WORSE,
FOR RICHER OR POORER,
TUCKED OR UNTUCKED,
TILL DEATH DO YOU PART?
- I DO.
- OH, I DO.
- I DO.
- I DO.
- I NOW PRONOUNCE YOU MARRIED.
YOU MAY KISS THE BRIDES.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
- WHAT LOVE HAS JOINED TOGETHER,
LET NO MAN PUT ASUNDER.
EVERYBODY SAY LOVE.
- LOVE!
- EVERYBODY SAY LOVE!
- LOVE!
- CONDRAGULATIONS.
WHOO!
- OH,
I CAUGHT IT.
I'M SO GOOD.
- YOU THROW LIKE A GIRL.
- COMING UP...
FIRST UP, JOSLYN FOX.
- WE GOT A RUNAWAY BRIDE.
[ENGINE REVS]
[ENGINE REVS]
- WELCOME, LADIES.
NOW IT'S TIME FOR THE
JUDGES' CRITIQUES.
FIRST UP, JOSLYN FOX.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK
AT BRANDON BEFORE.
WELL, HELLO,
BRADONNA FOX!
- WOW.
WELL, JOSLYN LOOKS ABSOLUTELY
GORGEOUS, BUT IT LACKS SOME
SORT OF UNITY BETWEEN
THE TWO OF YOU.
- YOUR DRAG DAUGHTER--
THE FACE IS NOT HER COLOR.
SHE LOOKS METALLIC.
IT'S REALLY OFF-PUTTING.
- NOT LOVING THIS
WHOLE WEDDING GOWN.
THE WAIST ISN'T GIVING US
THE DEFINITION THAT
WE WANT TO SEE.
- SO, BRADONNA, WAS THERE
ANYTHING YOU WERE
UNCOMFORTABLE WITH?
- JUST MY MANLIHOOD
BEING QUESTIONED.
- AND WHO WAS QUESTIONING IT?
- NO ONE HERE, BUT IT
WILL BE QUESTIONED.
[LAUGHTER]
- THAT'S YET TO COME.
- REALLY?
- YEAH?
- WE GOT A RUNAWAY BRIDE.
- IS HE OK?
[BRADONNA VOMITING]
- JOSLYN, WILL YOU CHECK
ON YOUR DRAG DAUGHTER?
[BRADONNA VOMITING]
- NO, DON'T BE SORRY.
I'M SORRY.
- SO WHILE WE SORT THAT OUT,
WE WILL CONTINUE
WITH THE CRITIQUES.
- NEXT UP IS COURTNEY ACT.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK
AT STEVE BEFORE...
- WOW.
- AND AFTER AS RIEN ACT.
WUBBA, WUBBA.
DO YOU FEEL PRETTY?
- I FEEL HOTTER THAN MY WIFE.
- OH!
- YOU'RE GETTING A
BACKHAND FOR THAT.
WHY DID WE GO
WITH THIS LENGTH?
- UM, WELL, WE DECIDED
THAT WE'RE DOING,
LIKE, A LITTLE SOUTHERN
LOUISIANA WEDDING, AND, UM...
- YOU THINK
THAT SAYS LOUISIANA?
- I REALLY FELT THAT YOU'RE
THE BRIDE, AND RIEN ACT IS
YOUR MOTHER, IN A WAY.
- I'M LIKE THE COUGAR MOM AT
THE WEDDING WHO HITS ON ALL
OF THE DAUGHTER'S
SINGLE FRIENDS.
- UH, YOU'D SHOW ME UP
AT MY WEDDING LIKE THAT,
BITCH, YOU'RE GOING HOME.
- NEXT UP, BIANCA
DEL RIO AND ALEX.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK
AT ALEX BEFORE...
- HUBBA, HUBBA.
- MM-HMM.
- AND AFTER, FIFI DEL RIO.
- I THINK THE
DEL RIOS NAILED IT.
- THE FAMILY
RESEMBLANCE IS ON POINT.
I WISH THERE WAS A LITTLE
BIT OF A TRAIN IN THE BACK.
- I MEAN, HE WAS BATTLING
SHOES ALREADY AND EYELASHES
AND HIS BALLS AND HIS ASS.
I MEAN, DID I REALLY WANT TO
GIVE HIM A TRAIN, TOO?
[LAUGHTER]
- WHAT WAS IT LIKE
WORKING WITH BIANCA?
- IT WAS WONDERFUL.
THANK YOU, MOMMY.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.
DON'T CALL ME MOMMY
IN PUBLIC.
[LAUGHTER]
- ALL RIGHT, NEXT UP,
DARIENNE LAKE AND DAMON.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK
AT DAMON BEFORE.
- WOW, UNREAL.
- NOW, DO YOU THINK
YOU'LL DO DRAG AGAIN?
- I MIGHT TRY
OUT FOR THE SHOW.
[LAUGHTER]
- MY WORD.
- IT'S KIND OF A RISK YOU
GOING AWAY FROM, LIKE,
A TRADITIONAL WEDDING GOWN,
BUT IT FITS YOUR PERSONALITY,
AND WE'RE FEELING YOUR
ENERGY, DEFINITELY.
- I DIDN'T GET THE GOTH THING,
AND I DIDN'T GET GOTH FROM
YOU EITHER.
YOUR OUTFIT TO ME SEEMS
A LITTLE COCKTAIL PARTY
DRESS TO ME.
- NEXT UP,
BENDELACREME AND KEVIN.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK
AT KEVIN BEFORE...
- ANOTHER BEARD.
- AND AFTER,
SUZETTE A LA MODE.
- I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE
SEEN A LITTLE MORE OF THAT
KIND OF SEVERE ANGLE THAT YOU
DO ON YOUR OWN EYE MAKEUP.
LOVE THE ATTENTION TO
DETAIL ON ALL THE ROSETTES.
OVERALL, WELL DONE.
- AND IT'S THE FIRST TIME
THAT YOUR WIFE HAS SEEN YOU
WITHOUT A BEARD.
- YES, EVER.
WE'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER
FOR 6 YEARS, AND I'VE
HAD THE BEARD FOR 7,
SO SHE'S NEVER SEEN
ME WITHOUT IT UNTIL TODAY.
- I BET SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHO
THE HELL SHE WAS MARRYING.
[LAUGHTER]
- NEXT UP, ADORE DELANO.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT
RYAN BEFORE...
- MM.
- AND AFTERWARD AS
HONEY BUN DELANO.
- IT'S ALL JUST A LITTLE BIT
OF A MESS KIND OF FOR ME.
I JUST WISH THAT THE OVERALL
EXECUTION WOULD HAVE BEEN
MORE ON POINT.
- NOW,
WHAT KIND OF BRIDE DID
YOU AND AMY WANT TO BE?
AFTER TALKING WITH ADORE,
WE DECIDED TO GO MORE
IN A PUNK DIRECTION.
- I LOVE THAT YOU WANT
TO PUT FUN INTO IT
AND STUFF LIKE THAT...
- YEAH.
- BUT IT DIDN'T LOOK LIKE
YOU WERE HER MOTHER AT ALL.
- I'M NOT EVEN SURE I SEE ANY
KIND OF A FAMILY RESEMBLANCE.
I THINK YOU FAILED THAT PART.
- THANK YOU, LADIES.
WHILE YOU UNTUCK IN THE
FORMDECOR LOUNGE, THE JUDGES
AND I WILL DELIBERATE.
ALL RIGHT, JUST BETWEEN
US IN-LAWS, LET'S START
WITH THE FOXES.
- THE DRESS WAS A DISASTER.
IT WAS LIKE SCHLUMP IN HEELS.
- I FEEL SO BAD THAT
BRANDON GOT SICK, BUT I KIND
OF WOULD'VE FELT THE SAME WAY
IF I LIFTED THE VEIL
AND MY FACE LOOKED LIKE THAT.
- HA HA!
- COURTNEY ACT AND RIEN ACT.
- OVERALL, THE
MAKEUP LOOKED GREAT.
THEIR HAIR LOOKED GREAT.
BUT THE OUTFIT THAT RIEN ACT HAD
LOOKED SORT OF LIKE A BEDSPREAD.
- I WAS SO AFFECTED BY THE
DRAG MOTHER STEALING ALL
THE LIMELIGHT--
IT'S NOT RIGHT.
- BIANCA DEL RIO
AND FIFI DEL RIO.
- THE DRESS WAS ON
POINT AND WELL DONE.
- I WOULD MISTAKE FIFI AS
A WOMAN IF I SAW HER
ON THE STREET.
- DAVID, YOU DON'T GET
OUT TOO OFTEN, DO YOU?
[LAUGHTER]
- NO.
- ALL RIGHT, DARIENNE LAKE
AND ANN DROGYNY LAKE.
- I LOVE THE GOTH KIND
OF EMO BRIDE.
- I JUST WISH DARIENNE
WOULD HAVE TAKEN IT FURTHER.
- IT MADE NO SENSE.
IT WAS EDGAR ALLAN POE MEETS
NEW JERSEY HOUSEWIFE MOM.
SHE WAS MY LEAST
FAVORITE OF ALL OF THEM.
- BENDELACREME AND
SUZETTE A LA MODE.
- THE TRANSFORMATION WITH
KEVIN WAS EXTRAORDINARY.
- BENDELA LOOKED GREAT.
THE COLOR WAS TERRIFIC ON HER.
- ADORE AND HONEY BUN DELANO.
- THE ATTENTION TO
DETAIL IS NONEXISTENT.
ALL THAT BLACK UNDERNEATH THE
EYE--NOT FLATTERING, ROUGH.
ROUGH, ROUGH, ROUGH.
- AND I CAN'T EVEN SAY
SHE FOCUSED ON HERSELF,
BECAUSE THAT WAS A MESS TOO.
THEY WERE BOTH A DISASTER.
- SO, NEIL, OF THE
OUTFITS UP THERE,
WHICH ONE WOULD
YOU WEAR RIGHT NOW?
- OH, COURTNEY ACT'S.
- COURTNEY ACT'S.
- TOTALLY NUDE
WITH BUTTERFLIES.
- YOU SLUT.
- IT WOULD BE FANTASTIC.
- OH, MY GOD,
YOU'RE SUCH A WHORE.
WE SHOULD GO
SOMEWHERE TOGETHER.
- HOW DARE YOU!
[LAUGHTER]
- SILENCE.
I'VE MADE MY DECISION.
BRING BACK THE DIVORCE LAWYER.
[ENGINE REVS]
[ENGINE REVS]
- WELCOME BACK, LADIES.
I'VE MADE SOME DECISIONS.
- MY HEART'S POUNDING
OUT OF MY CHEST.
- BENDELACREME, YOU GAVE
SUZETTE AND AMY A WEDDING
THEY'LL ALWAYS REMEMBER,
AND YOU LEFT US TICKLED PINK.
YOU ARE SAFE.
- THANK YOU.
- YAY!
- BIANCA DEL RIO, WE LOVED
YOUR MAKEOVER SO MUCH, YOU ARE
THE WINNER OF THIS
WEEK'S MAIN CHALLENGE.
[APPLAUSE]
- I KNEW IT.
- YAY.
- AND YOU'VE WON A TRIP FOR
TWO TO THE HONEYMOON PARADISE
OF HAWAII.
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
- AND SO HAS YOUR COUPLE,
ALEX AND EDDIE.
- OH, MY GOD!
- I'M GOING TO HAWAII.
HEH HEH HEH!
- ADORE DELANO, YOUR PUNK
BRIDE GAVE US A SERIOUS CASE
OF THE WEDDING BELL BLUES.
I'M SORRY, MY DEAR, BUT
YOU ARE UP FOR ELIMINATION.
- OH.
- COURTNEY ACT, YOU MADE
RIEN ACT A BLUSHING
BRIDE, BUT WE
CAN'T SAY YES TO HER DRESS.
- YOU'RE SAFE.
- WHEW.
- GOSH.
- OH.
- DARIENNE LAKE, TONIGHT
THE BRIDE WORE BLACK,
BUT THE JUDGES WEREN'T
RAVING ABOUT IT.
JOSLYN, YOU ARE A FOXY
DRAG MAMA, BUT YOUR BRIDE'S
MAKEOVER NEEDED A MAKEOVER.
JOSLYN FOX, I'M SORRY,
MY DEAR, BUT YOU ARE
UP FOR ELIMINATION.
- OH, MY GOSH.
- DARIENNE LAKE, YOU ARE SAFE.
YOU MAY JOIN THE OTHER GIRLS.
- THANK YOU.
- TWO QUEENS STAND BEFORE ME.
LADIES, THIS IS YOUR LAST
CHANCE TO IMPRESS ME AND SAVE
YOURSELF FROM ELIMINATION.
THE TIME HAS COME TO
LIP-SYNCH FOR YOUR LIFE.
- I'M REALLY, REALLY
DETERMINED TO NOT GO HOME.
THIS SHIT IS
GONNA STOP HERE.
- GOOD LUCK, AND
DON'T FUCK IT UP.
- NOTHING'S REALLY EVER
PLANNED WHEN I PERFORM,
AND IT'S NOT GONNA
CHANGE HERE.
I'M JUST GONNA GO WITH IT
AND FEEL THE SPIRIT
OF ARETHA FRANKLIN.
I'M GONNA GET CHURCH
ON THIS BITCH.
- I AM JUST PREACHING
TO THOSE JUDGES.
YOU BETTER THINK
BEFORE YOU SEND ME HOME.
- WHOO!
BUT I'M NOT IF YOU KEEP
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
- LADIES, I'VE
MADE MY DECISION.
ADORE DELANO,
SHANTE YOU STAY.
YOU MAY JOIN THE OTHER GIRLS.
- THANK YOU.
I'M SORRY, JOSLYN.
I WISH I COULD HAVE
DONE MORE TO HELP YOU.
- JOSLYN FOX, FOR BETTER OR
FOR WORST-ER, KEEP IT FOXY.
(HONKING)
NOW, SASHAY AWAY.
- THANK YOU.
[APPLAUSE]
- I'M JUST SO PROUD OF MYSELF,
AND I'M SO PROUD OF THIS JOURNEY
THAT I'VE MADE,
AND I'LL BE FOREVER CHANGED.
I'M READY TO GO HOME, BUT THIS
HAS BECOME MY HOME, AND THESE
GIRLS HAVE BECOME MY SISTERS.
- MAKE ME PROUD,
GIRLS. I LOVE YOU.
KEEP IT FOXY.
- MY FIERCE FIVE,
THE HONEYMOON IS OVER.
BACK TO WORK.
AND REMEMBER, IF YOU CAN'T
LOVE YOURSELF, HOW IN THE HELL
ARE YOU GONNA LOVE
SOMEBODY ELSE?
- CAN I GET AN
AMEN UP IN HERE?
- AMEN.
- ALL RIGHT, NOW,
LET THE MUSIC PLAY.
[DANCE MUSIC PLAYING]


- PREVIOUSLY
ON "RUPAUL'S DRAG RACE."
- WHEN I WAS 17,
I APPEARED ON "AMERICAN IDOL."
- I WAS A FINALIST
ON THE FIRST SEASON
OF "AUSTRALIAN IDOL."
- OH, WE'RE PLAYING THAT
THIS YEAR, BITCH?
- FOR THIS WEEK'S MAIN
CHALLENGE,
YOU'LL BE SCREEN TESTING
FOR "DRAG RACE ME TO HELL."
- ACTION.
- [SCREAMING]
- DID YOU GUYS REHEARSE
AS A TEAM BEFORE YOU CAME ON?
- YEAH.
- LIZA MINNELLI LIES.
- DARIENNE LAKE,
YOU ARE THE WINNER
OF THIS WEEK'S MAIN CHALLENGE.
- WHAT?
- APRIL CARRION,
SHANTE, YOU STAY.
VIVACIOUS, SASHAY AWAY.
- OOH, THAT WAS A CLOSE ONE.
- I KNOW, GIRL.
- UGH!
VIVACIOUS JUST GOT ELIMINATED
AND I'M FUCKING GLAD
TO GET ANOTHER BITCH
OUT OF HERE,
BECAUSE, HONEY,
WE NEED TO START
KNOCKING THEM ONE BY ONE.
- THANK YOU, MISS VIVACIOUS.
YOU WILL BE MISSED.
I'M DETERMINED TO SHOW RU
THAT I AM WORTHY OF BEING HERE.
THESE BITCHES BETTER GET READY
BECAUSE I'VE JUST GOTTEN
A WAKE-UP CALL.
- PARTY.
- [GROANS]
- OY, MAMI, OY.
- [MOANING]
- YES, WHO'S SERVING?
- ARE YOU IN
A WHITE SNAKE VIDEO?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING OVER THERE?
- I'M FEELING MY OATS.
LET ME FEEL MY OATS.
- WHEN I FIRST MET GIA,
I DIDN'T LIKE HER.
- YOU LADYBOY?
YOU LADYBOY?
- NOW, SHE'S KIND OF
GROWN ON ME,
LIKE A RASH.
BEING FISH IS NOT GOING TO WIN
THIS COMPETITION.
- DON'T BE COMING
OVER HERE, NOW,
BECAUSE YOU ALL SAFE AND STUFF.
NOW, YOU'RE THROWING IN
MY MOTHERFUCKING PIT.
- SUBTITLES.
SHE'S FISH,
BUT SHE'S GONNA BE FLOATING
ON TOP--
DEAD.
- THE WINNER
OF "RUPAUL'S DRAG RACE"
RECEIVES A SICKENING SUPPLY
OF COLOREVOLUTION COSMETICS
AND A CASH PRIZE OF $100,000.
WITH EXTRA SPECIAL GUEST JUDGES,
LUCIAN PIANE
AND SHERYL LEE RALPH.
- OH, YES, HONEY,
CLAP FOR THE KIDS.
- AH!
- IT'S A BRAND NEW DAY
IN THE WORKROOM.
EVERYBODY'S FEELING
OUR OATS, GRAINS,
WHEATS, THINS,
EVERYTHING.
WE'RE READY FOR ALL THE TWISTED
AND SICK LITTLE CHALLENGES
THAT RU HAS IN STORE FOR US.
- SO, WHO'S EXCITED FOR TODAY?
- ME, ME, ME.
- I WAS UNTIL I HEARD
YOUR VOICE.
- OH, BITCH,
HERE SHE GOES.
[SIREN WAILS]
- OOH, GIRL.
HEY, DREAM GIRLS.
NOW THAT YOU'VE HAD
YOUR SPRING AWAKENING,
IT'S TIME TO STRAP ON
YOUR KINKY BOOTS
AND FORM A CHORUS LINE.
AND IT BETTER BE WICKED GOOD.
OTHERWISE,
IT'S BYE-BYE, BIRDIE.
[GIGGLES]
- COME ON, MUSICAL THEATER!
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
- YES!
- HELLO, HELLO, HELLO.
- HI!
- NOW, THIS WEEK,
IN THE MOST AMBITIOUS CHALLENGE
IN "DRAG RACE" HISTORY,
YOU'LL BE PERFORMING LIVE
IN THE ORIGINAL
PRODUCTION OF...
"SHADE, THE RUSICAL."
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
- I LOVE MUSICAL THEATER.
IT'S JUST SO CAMPY
AND CHEESY AND--ME!
- NOW, YOU'LL BE WORKING
IN TWO GROUPS.
BENDELACREME AND ADORE DELANO,
YOU GET TO CHOOSE
YOUR CASTMATES
AND ASSIGN THE ROLES--
BACK ROLLS.
[LAUGHTER]
- I'LL START OFF
WITH MISS COURTNEY.
[GASPS]
- I'M GONNA GO WITH MILK.
- MISS HOW-TO-
SUCCEED-IN-BITCHINESS-
WITHOUT-REALLY-TRYING,
MISS BIANCA DEL RIO.
- AH, YOU'RE SO CLEVER.
- MISS LAGANJA ESTRANJA.
- EVERYTHING'S COMING UP ROSES,
DARLING.
- DE LA?
- MISS DARIENNE LAKE.
- OH, THANK YOU.
- MISS JOSLYN FOX.
- GIA, MY PET.
- YEAH!
- MISS APRIL.
- AND THAT MEANS
TRINITY K. BONET,
YOU'RE WITH
BENDELACREME'S TEAM.
[APPLAUSE]
- YAY, I GOT PICKED
LAST AGAIN.
NO BIGGIE,
IT IS WHAT IT IS.
- LATER TODAY,
YOU'LL BE WORKING
WITH THE COMPOSER
OF "SHADE, THE RUSICAL,"
LUCIAN PIANE.
[APPLAUSE]
LADIES, I EXPECT PERFORMANCES
WORTHY OF THE GREAT WHITE WAY.
BUT THEN AGAIN,
WHY IT GOTTA BE WHITE?
[LAUGHTER]
THEATER PEOPLE,
START YOUR ENGINES,
AND MAY THE BEST WOMAN WIN.
- ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
LET'S MAKE SOME MAGIC.
MY GOAL AS A LEADER
IS TO FIGURE OUT
HOW TO UTILIZE
EVERYONE IN THE GROUP BEST.
INGENUE QUEEN, PENNY.
WE'RE JUST ALL ASSUMING
YOU'RE PENNY, RIGHT?
I MEAN, THAT'S WHAT--
[LAUGHS]
- I'M HAPPY TO PLAY PENNY.
- COURTNEY'S THE OBVIOUS PENNY.
THAT'S JUST WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.
PAGEANT QUEENS, COMEDY QUEENS.
I JUST KEEP THINKING
IT WOULD BE HYSTERICAL
TO SEE YOU PLAY
A PAGEANT QUEEN.
- NO, THAT'S FINE WITH ME.
- TRINITY, DOES BEING
A PAGEANT QUEEN
OR A COMEDY QUEEN SEEM
INTERESTING TO YOU?
- NO, I DON'T WANT
TO BE THE FUCK-UP,
SO I'D RATHER JUST
KIND OF PLAY IT SAFE.
- YOU PREFER TO BE
A PAGEANT QUEEN?
- YEAH.
- YEAH, OKAY.
- TRINITY,
SHE ALWAYS SEEMS OVER IT,
NOTHING EXCITES HER.
- DO WE WANT TO HAVE
A SING-THROUGH?
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
- OKAY.
- THERE'S A BIT OF PRESSURE
BECAUSE ADORE
IS A SINGER, AS WELL.
- BOTH ADORE AND COURTNEY
ARE AMAZING SINGERS.
"SHADE, THE RUSICAL"
HAS NOW BECOME
THE BATTLE OF THE IDOLS.
- I'M GONNA TAKE HER DOWN.
- COMING UP--
- GIA, HER VOICE IS LIKE
NAILS ON A CHALKBOARD.
- EEHH!
- TRINITY IS GETTING
A LITTLE RUDE.
- CAN WE DO IT?
BECAUSE IT'S A LOT DIFFERENT.
- CALM DOWN, BEYONCE.
- [LAUGHS]
- [LAUGHS]
- [LAUGHS]
OUR CHALLENGE IS TO PERFORM
IN THE WORLD PREMIERE
OF "SHADE, THE RUSICAL."
WE HAVE TO ACT,
SING, AND DANCE,
AND DO IT ALL LIVE, MAMA.
- OKAY, NOW WE CAN GO THROUGH,
LIKE, WHO'S WHO.
- THAT SAYS "GOOD PENNY"
AND "BAD PENNY."
- "FISH OIL HAS TURNED PENNY
INTO A HORRIBLE DIVA BITCH."
BAD PENNY IS CLEARLY ME.
COURTNEY IS DEFINITELY
GOOD PENNY.
SHE'S VERY DISNEY,
AND I'M VERY COURTNEY LOVE.
AMANDA, PRETTY BUT BUTCH QUEEN.
- I DON'T WANT TO BE
A BUTCH QUEEN.
- OKAY, I DON'T WANNA MAKE HER
A BUTCH QUEEN AGAIN.
- I COULD BE BERTHA,
BUT BERTHA IS LIKE A BIG GIRL,
SO, WOULD I--I DON'T KNOW,
JUST PAD MYSELF, I GUESS?
- JUST PAD YOURSELF
TO HIGH HEAVENS.
- I AM HAPPY BECAUSE
I DIDN'T GET THE BUTCH CARD,
SO THANK GOD FOR THAT,
"DIOS MIO," YEAH.
- GIA, HER VOICE IS LIKE
NAILS ON A CHALKBOARD.
- GIA'S VOICE IS KIND OF LIKE
IF FRAN DRESCHER
GOT STEAMROLLED
BY, LIKE, A DYING DUCK.
EEHH!
- [SINGING OUT OF TUNE]
- HELLO, HELLO, HELLO.
- HI!
- HOW ARE MY MUSICAL
THEATER QUEENS?
- FABULOUS.
- WELL, TEAM BENDELACREME,
WHO'S PLAYING WHO?
- WELL, OUR INGENUE PENNY
WILL BE PLAYED
BY MISS COURTNEY ACT.
- YOU'RE GOOD PENNY.
- YEAH.
- ARE YOU PREPARED TO SING
THE CRAP OUT OF THIS PART?
- I AM.
MY LATEST THING
I'VE BEEN WORKING ON
IS WHISTLE TONE.
- OH, LIKE MARIAH.
- YEAH.
[SCREECHES]
- NOW TRINITY,
YOU SEEM QUIET.
HAVE YOU DONE
MUSICAL THEATER?
- UH, IN JUNIOR HIGH.
- YEAH, BUT SHE PLAYED
A TREE, SO.
- OH, OKAY.
- JUST LIKE THE ACTING
CHALLENGE, YOU KNOW,
THIS IS NEW FOR ME, TOO.
SO, YOU KNOW,
I'M GOING TO GIVE IT
MY BEST AND--YOU KNOW.
I'M A DRAG QUEEN.
I LIP-SYNC,
I DON'T SING LIVE.
- THIS IS REALLY
ONE OF THOSE CHALLENGES
WHERE YOU HAVE
TO WORK TOGETHER,
AND AT THE SAME TIME,
STAND OUT AS THE STAR
THAT YOU ARE.
- YES.
- SO, GET TO IT, LADIES.
- THANK YOU, SIR.
- THANK YOU.
- WELL, TEAM ADORE, HELLO.
- HELLO, HELLO!
- I'M SO EXCITED.
- IT'S GONNA BE A PARTY.
- NOW, ADORE, WHAT CHARACTER
ARE YOU PLAYING?
- I AM PLAYING BAD PENNY.
- NOW, THAT'S A BIG
SINGING ROLE, ISN'T IT?
- IT IS.
- THAT'S SOMETHING
YOU SHOULD EXCEL AT.
- IT SHOULD BE COOL.
- WELL, WHY DO YOU
DOUBT YOURSELF LIKE THAT?
LAST WEEK,
THE NOTE FOR YOU
WAS TO BE PREPARED
WHEN YOU HIT THE SET.
YOU HAVE TO DO YOUR HOMEWORK.
- I'M PRETTY NERVOUS,
BECAUSE I REALLY, REALLY
WANT THE JUDGES
TO SEE THAT I'M NOT
A FILLER BITCH.
- SO, YOU 3 ARE
THE SHOWGIRLS.
- YES.
- NOW, WHO ARE YOU PLAYING?
- I'M THE BUTCH QUEEN.
- YOU'RE A BUTCH QUEEN?
WHERE ARE YOU GONNA
DRAW YOUR INSPIRATION?
- BIANCA DEL RIO.
- [LAUGHTER]
- WHOO!
- YES, MA'AM!
- QUEEN DOWN.
- OKAY!
- I CANNOT WAIT TO SEE IT.
ALL RIGHT,
GATHER ROUND, THESPIANS.
PEOPLE, PLACES, PEOPLE.
TOMORROW, AFTER
YOUR MUSICAL DEBUT,
THE DRESS CODE
FOR THE MAIN STAGE IS...
TONY AWARDS GLAMOUR.
- YEAH!
NOW, AS WE SAY
IN THE THEATER, DARLING,
BREAK A LEG,
AND DON'T FUCK IT UP.
- ALL RIGHT.
- IT'S OUR TEAM'S TURN
TO COME IN
AND REHEARSE WITH LUCIAN.
I HAVE DONE SOME MUSICAL THEATER
IN MY PAST,
SO, PIECE OF CAKE.
- HELLO, LADIES.
- HI.
- THIS IS DENISE.
- HEY.
- SHE'S OUR CELEBRITY
CHOREOGRAPHER
AND MY SISTER.
AND OVER HERE,
WE HAVE OUR LADY J,
TRANS ICON
AND PIANIST TO THE STARS.
- HI, GUYS.
- HI.
- OKAY, SO, WHY DON'T YOU
SING OUT A LITTLE BIT, OKAY?
HERE WE GO.
- OKAY,
THERE AT THE END,
MAKE SURE YOUR LAST NOTE
IS THE MOST IMPRESSIVE ONE.
YOU CAN MAKE IT
YOUR MOMENT, YOU KNOW?
- I THINK I'M GONNA BE HELD TO
A HIGHER STANDARD ON THIS ONE,
AND WHEN YOU'RE LIVE ON STAGE,
YOU'VE GOT ONE CHANCE.
DON'T FUCK IT UP.
- OH, CUTE.
LITERALLY.
- CUT, CUT, CUT.
WHEN YOU SAY "LITERALLY,"
YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT THE JOKE IS, THERE?
- UM, NOT REALLY.
- IT'S A FART JOKE.
IT'S BECAUSE IT SMELLS--
SMELLS BAD, SO, UH...
IF YOU CAN PLAY UP
THE COMEDY OF IT,
THEN THAT WILL SELL.
YOU GUYS RIGHT NOW
ARE NOT REALLY
FUNNY AT ALL.
- FUCK.
- OKAY, REAL QUICK--
SO PAGEANT QUEENS,
CAN I SHOW YOU
YOUR MOVEMENT REAL QUICK
FOR THIS SECTION?
OKAY, YOU'RE GONNA
STEP FORWARD
ON THE LEFT LEG
TO STRUT, OKAY?
- I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY,
I'M SORRY, I NEED TO KNOW,
WHEN SHE SAID--WHEN SHE SAID
"WHO ARE YOU?"
- WE ARE THE PAGEANT QUEENS.
- DOES THAT MAKE SENSE?
- CAN WE DO IT?
BECAUSE IT'S A LOT DIFFERENT
WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO--
AND THEN FALL BACK INTO IT.
- WELL, THAT'S HOW WE GET TO
RUN IT SO THAT YOU CAN TRY IT.
- TRINITY IS GETTING
A LITTLE RUDE.
IT AIN'T DENISE'S FAULT THAT
TRINITY CAN'T GET THE MOVES.
CALM DOWN, BEYONCE.
[WHISPERING]
SO, TURN, YOU KNOW--
- WE'RE GOING DOWN,
AND NOT IN A GOOD WAY.
- SORRY, IF I SUCK, I SUCK.
- COMING UP--
- TAKE A SECOND AND CALM DOWN.
- BECAUSE YOU DON'T DO
ANYTHING WRONG.
- I DIDN'T SAY THAT, BITCH.
- [LAUGHS]
- [LAUGHS]
- THIS WEEK'S CHALLENGE
IS TO PERFORM
IN "SHADE, THE RUSICAL."
- HELLO, LADIES.
- HI.
- ALL RIGHT, SO LET'S GO.
- WHY ARE YOU AFRAID?
AREN'T YOU THE SINGER?
- SPIT IT OUT, ADORE.
- IT'S REALLY INTIMIDATING
TO HAVE THE PERSON
WHO ACTUALLY WROTE THIS
IN FRONT OF YOU WHILE
YOU'RE BUTCHERING THE LYRICS.
- I KNOW THAT ALL THOSE WORDS,
THAT'S A LOT.
YOU HAVE TO GET
ALL THAT DOWN,
BECAUSE WHEN YOU GET LOST,
IT IMMEDIATELY SHOWS
IN YOUR EYES.
- I KNOW.
- YOU LOOK ABSOLUTELY TERRIFIED.
- THIS IS THE CHANCE, BASICALLY,
FOR ME TO PROVE MYSELF,
SO, I GOT TO GET IT TOGETHER.
[GIGGLES]
- YOU HAVE A VERY UNIQUE TONE
TO YOUR VOICE.
- I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT.
I LIKE TO THINK THAT I HAVE
A RATHER DISTINCTIVE VOICE.
[LAUGHS]
I'VE EMBRACED IT.
- 2, 3, 4.
- OKAY, STOP FOR ONE SECOND.
THAT SORT OF RHYTHMIC
TALK-SINGING
THAT YOU'RE DOING RIGHT NOW
IS NOT COMING OFF THAT GREAT.
- AY, DIOS MIO.
- APRIL, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO NECESSARILY SCREAM IT OUT--
- WELL, YOU JUST
WENT UP AGAIN.
- I NEED TO PROVE
THAT I CAN PULL THIS
FOR ME AND FOR MY TEAM,
SO, I CAN'T BE
A DOWNWARD DEBBIE--
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HER NAME IS.
- SHOWGIRLS,
YOUR ACT IS GOING TO BE
THE SINK-OR-SWIM THING
OF THIS WHOLE TEAM.
- THIS IS A HUGE CHALLENGE.
LIKE, ONE PERSON'S OFF,
WE ALL FALL LIKE DOMINOES.
- TRINITY IS DEFINITELY
NOT 100% HERE,
IS SHE FRUSTRATED SEXUALLY?
I HAVE NO IDEA,
BUT GUESS WHAT?
WE HAVE ABOUT THIS MUCH TIME
AND ABOUT THIS MUCH WORK TO DO,
SO, BITCH, GET INTO IT.
- ALL RIGHT, FROM THE TOP.
- TURN AROUND.
- NO, YOU'RE COMING
WITH ME, MISSY.
BOOM.
- I'M YOU.
DO YOU SEE THE DIFFICULTNESS
IN DOING IT BACKWARDS
AND THEN TRYING TO TURN AROUND
AT THE SAME TIME?
IT'S REALLY, REALLY FAST.
- SHE HAS TO BE HERE.
- IT TOOK YOU TOO LONG TO MOVE,
I'M TELLING YOU,
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO HIT IT.
YOU HAVE TO TRY TO--
- CONSIDERING THIS HAS BEEN
YOUR PROBLEM AREA,
TAKE A SECOND AND CALM DOWN.
I WALK TO HER,
AND I SAY "TURN AROUND."
I WOULD SUGGEST YOU FIGURE OUT
WHAT YOU NEED TO DO
PRIOR TO TELLING ME
WHAT I'M NOT DOING RIGHT.
- YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT,
BIANCA,
BECAUSE YOU DON'T DO
ANYTHING WRONG.
- I DIDN'T SAY THAT, BITCH.
- I APOLOGIZE THAT I OPENED
MY MOUTH, AND THAT'S WHY
I DON'T SAY ANYTHING
IN THE FIRST PLACE.
- COVER GIRL,
PUT THAT BASS IN YOUR WALK,
COME ON!
- COME ON, GIRL.
- TODAY, ON THE MAIN STAGE,
OUR RUNWAY LOOK
IS TONY AWARDS GLAMOUR,
AND WE'RE PERFORMING
IN "SHADE, THE RUSICAL."
WE HAVE TO SING LIVE,
ALTHOUGH YOU'VE SEEN
SOME OF THE PEOPLE
IN MY GROUP.
- YOU READY TO SERVE
SOME PAGEANT REALNESS OUT THERE?
- YES, GOD, BITCH, UGH.
- OKAY?
- I'M GOING TO GET ME
A TONY TONIGHT.
- WHAT'S A TONY?
- SO, YOU WERE ON THE IDOL
OF THE AMERICAN.
- YES.
AND YOU WERE ON THE IDOL
OF THE AUSTRALIAN.
- I WAS.
I WENT ALONG
THE FIRST DAY AS A BOY
AND I GOT KNOCKED BACK,
AND SO THEN I WENT BACK
THE NEXT DAY IN DRAG,
AND I MADE IT THROUGH
TO THE FINALS.
- HOLY CRAP.
- I WAS THE FIRST OUT GAY PERSON
AND THE FIRST PERSON IN DRAG
TO BE ON ANY IDOL FRANCHISE
ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD.
- I WISH I COULD'VE DID THAT.
- YEAH, BUT ADORE,
DON'T YOU FEEL LIKE
YOU WERE SORT OF
THE AMERICAN COUNTERPART OF,
LIKE, THE FIRST REAL SORT OF
GAY PERSON ON "AMERICAN IDOL?"
- YEAH, BUT I WAS
KIND OF ADVISED
TO JUST NOT BE SO OUT THERE.
- SO, YOU ACTUALLY HAD TO, LIKE,
KIND OF KEEP YOURSELF--
- TONE IT DOWN A LITTLE.
- YEAH.
- RIGHT.
- SOME PEOPLE WEREN'T LIKING IT.
- MY MOM TOLD ME TO BUTCH IT UP
BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T WANT THEM
MAKING FUN OF ME.
SHE SHOULD'VE JUST LET ME
GO OUT THERE WITH PINK HAIR.
THAT WOULD'VE BEEN COOL.
- GIA, WHAT WERE SOME
OF YOUR TALENTS AS A CHILD
BESIDES TUCKING YOUR WEENIE
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT?
[LAUGHTER]
- I ACTUALLY WAS DOING
THE DANCE FORM OF KABUKI THEATER
SINCE I WAS 5 YEARS OLD.
IN JAPAN, KABUKI THEATER
IS ALL MEN,
BUT WE WOULDN'T, LIKE, GET
TUCKED AND, LIKE, PUT BOOBS ON
AND STUFF LIKE THAT.
IN MY CULTURE,
IT'S NOT A GAY THING,
SO EVEN STRAIGHT MEN DO IT.
IT'S AN ART.
THIS IS LIKE WHEN I WOULD DO,
LIKE, THE BOY ROLES.
AND THIS IS ONE I WOULD DO
THE FISH ROLE.
- NO WAY!
- LOOKING GOOD.
- WITH MY THEATER BACKGROUND
IN KABUKI,
I DEFINITELY HAVE
A GOOD SENSE
OF STAGE PRESENCE
AND THE CHOREOGRAPHY,
BUT AT THE SAME TIME,
I'M REALLY HOPING
FOR THE BEST,
BECAUSE SOME OF US
AIN'T SINGERS, WE DANCERS.
- WELCOME TO THE MAIN STAGE
OF "RUPAUL'S DRAG RACE,"
STAR OF "BREAST SIDE STORY,"
MICHELLE VISAGE.
- YES, AND AREN'T YOU AMAZING
IN TECHNICOLOR?
- AND FROM "THE BOOK OF MORON,"
SANTINO RICE.
[LAUGHTER]
- MY POSSE'S ON BROADWAY, RU.
- WELL, MY POSSE'S ON FIRE.
[LAUGHTER]
AND OUR VERY OWN MUSIC MAN,
LUCIAN PIANE.
HOW WAS IT WORKING
WITH MY BROADWAY BABIES?
- YOU ARE SURE IN FOR A TREAT.
- I'LL BE THE JUDGE OF THAT.
[LAUGHS]
AND THE LEGENDARY STAR
OF STAGE AND SCREEN,
THE OG DREAM GIRL,
SHERYL LEE RALPH.
- DARLING, LOOK AT YOU.
I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU.
- I AM SO EXCITED
TO HAVE YOU HERE.
THIS WEEK, WE CHALLENGED
OUR LEADING LADIES
TO TREAD THE BOARDS IN A MUSICAL
COMEDY EXTRAVAGANZA,
"SHADE, THE RUSICAL."
NOW, THEY'RE READY TO MAKE
THEIR OFF-OFF-OFF-OFF-OFF-
OFF-BROADWAY DEBUT.
GENTLEMEN, START YOUR ENGINES,
AND MAY THE BEST WOMAN WIN.
COMING UP--
- YOU GOT A LITTLE LOST.
- YOU WERE WAY OFF.
- IT'S LIKE YOU HAVE A BEARD
ON YOUR FOREHEAD.
- [LAUGHS]
- ACT ONE,
"SHADE, THE RUSICAL."
LET'S GO.
- IN THE CITY
OF DRAG QUEENS,
THERE'S A FINE LINE
BETWEEN BEING SHADY,
AND BEING A LADY.
THIS IS PENNY,
WHICH WILL SHE CHOOSE?
- WHO ARE YOU?
- OH, FANCY!
- WHAT?
- WHO ARE YOU?
- OH, CUTE.
- UGH!
- OH!
- LITERALLY.
- WHO'S THAT?
- WAIT!
- MISS OFF-A-BUS
- WHO?
- [GASP]
-OH.
- PENNY, YOU REALLY WANT
TO BE A STAR?
- YEAH, I DO.
- NO!
- DON'T DO IT.
- DON'T GO.
- SHE'S A MAN
WITH ONE EYE!
DRINK FOR ME.
- OH, I'D REALLY LIKE TO,
BUT I SHOULDN'T, I--
- DRINK FOR ME!
- I DO WANT TO BE A BIG,
BIG STAR.
- DRINK FOR ME!
- OH, I CAN'T GET IT OPEN.
- HERE.
[APPLAUSE]
- OH, ACT TWO
IS ABOUT TO BEGIN.
- THANKS TO FISH OIL,
OUR GOOD LITTLE PENNY
BECAME ONE BAD PENNY,
BUT SHE GOT HER FAME.
- THAT'S HOW YOU DO IT,
BACK ROLLS.
[LAUGHTER]
- BACK ROLLS.
- HEARD IT.
- BUT YOU HAVE TO.
- GIRL, THE PAYCHECK.
- OH, RIGHT.
- MM-HMM.
- AY, DIOS MIO,
SHE'S GOING DOWN!
TOO MUCH FISH OIL!
- NOW'S OUR CHANCE!
- WHOO!
- NO, GIRL.
[INDISTINCT CHATTER]
- OH, THE SHADE,
THE SHADE OF IT ALL.
[LAUGHTER]
- SO, EVEN IF YOU'RE
A PAGEANT QUEEN,
- OR A COMEDY QUEEN,
- A FISHY QUEEN,
- A SHADY QUEEN,
- OR JUST A BIG DAMN GIRL,
- WE ARE A FAMILY
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
- BRAVA!
- BRAVA!
- BRAVA!
[LAUGHS]
- [LAUGHS]
- BIANCA DEL RIO,
TRINITY K. BONET,
DARIENNE LAKE,
G--G--G--GIA,
BENDELACREME,
COURTNEY ACT,
LAGANJA ESTRANJA,
APRIL CARRION,
JOSLYN FOX,
MILK,
ADORE DELANO.
- WELCOME, LADIES.
THIS WEEK,
YOU COMPETED IN TEAMS,
BUT TONIGHT, YOU'LL BE JUDGED
AS INDIVIDUALS.
BIANCA DEL RIO,
MILK,
LAGANJA ESTRANJA,
GIA GUNN,
JOSLYN FOX...
YOU ARE ALL SAFE.
YOU MAY LEAVE THE STAGE.
LADIES, YOU REPRESENT
THE BEST AND THE WORST
OF THE WEEK.
IT'S TIME
FOR THE JUDGES' REVIEWS,
STARTING WITH
TRINITY K. BONET.
- YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL TONIGHT.
I LIKE THE WAY THE GOWN
ACCENTUATES YOUR HIPLINE.
- I DID LIKE YOUR CHARACTER
IN THE MUSICAL,
BUT I'M NOT ABLE
TO UNDERSTAND YOU.
IT'S KIND OF
A MUSH-MOUTH THING.
WE HEARD BIANCA,
AND THEN WE'D LOSE
YOUR LINE.
- IT'S ALL
A LEARNING EXPERIENCE.
- YES, YES, BUT YOU ARE
IN THE OLYMPICS OF DRAG.
- BUT EVERY STAR WAS CRAP
BEFORE THEY BECAME THE SHIT.
- LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING,
PUT A CORK IN IT.
LITERALLY,
GET A CORK,
PUT IT IN YOUR MOUTH,
SPEAK WITH THAT CORK
IN THE MOUTH.
IT WILL DO WONDERS
FOR ENUNCIATION.
- NEXT UP,
DARIENNE LAKE.
- LOOK AT YOU ALL PRETTY
IN YOUR POND SCUM GREEN.
- [LAUGHS]
OH, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
- AS FAR AS
YOUR COMEDY QUEEN GOES,
YOU GOT A LITTLE LOST.
- IT IS A LITTLE HARD
TO KIND OF CONTINUE ON
WITH A FIRE SIREN
BEING SQUASHED IN YOUR EAR.
- THAT'S GIA
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, RIGHT?
- OH, YEAH, YEAH.
- WELL, WHY DO YOU THINK
SHE'S SAFE AND YOU'RE HERE?
- 'CAUSE I THINK
I'M ONE OF THE TOP 3?
- ALL RIGHT, MOVING ON.
BENDELACREME.
- LET'S TALK ABOUT
THE WAY YOU LOOK.
I BELIEVE THAT LESS
IS ALWAYS BEST.
LOOK IN THE MIRROR,
TAKE A LITTLE BIT
OF SOMETHING AWAY.
- OH!
- THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT!
NOW, YOU ARE WORKING IT.
- I DID LIKE YOUR CHARACTER
IN THE MUSICAL,
BUT I FELT THAT
YOU COULD'VE TAKEN IT FURTHER.
- I LOVED YOUR PORTRAYAL
OF THE VILLAIN,
LOVED YOUR EVIL
BETTIE PAGE LOOK,
AND YOUR VOICE, TOO.
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.
- UP NEXT, COURTNEY ACT.
- THE ILLUSION
IS WORKING FOR ME.
A-MA-ZING.
AND YOU CAN REALLY SING.
FABULOUS.
- YOU ARE A STAR.
- THANK YOU.
- BUT I WAS ACTUALLY
REALLY NERVOUS IN REHEARSALS,
BECAUSE YOU WERE
MISSING CUES.
- I WAS MUFFLING TWO WORDS,
BUT I NAILED IT ON THE NIGHT.
- NEXT UP, ADORE DELANO.
- TONIGHT, THE DRESS,
FOR ME, COULD BE LONGER.
IT COULD GO TO THE FLOOR.
- WHY IS YOUR WAIST
NOT CINCHED
WHEN I JUST TALKED TO YOU
ABOUT THIS?
- BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE, LIKE,
A "CINCHER" CINCHER, ONLY--
- BORROW A WAIST CINCHER
AND GIVE ME THE SILHOUETTE
I NEED FROM YOU,
ADORE DELANO.
- I'M A BETTER DRAG QUEEN
THAN I'M COMING OFF, I SWEAR.
- [LAUGHS]
- I LOVED YOUR VOICE.
I THOUGHT THAT
YOU COULD COMPETE
IN "AMERICAN IDOL."
- I DID.
- SEE THAT?
I GOT THAT IMMEDIATELY.
- PARTY.
- HA!
PARTY.
[LAUGHTER]
- NEXT UP, APRIL CARRION.
- WELL, YOUR FACE
IS ALWAYS BEAT FOR THE GODS,
BUT I THINK YOUR SHADING'S
A LITTLE DARK
TOWARDS YOUR HAIRLINE.
- IT'S LIKE YOU HAVE
A BEARD ON YOUR FOREHEAD.
- APRIL, I KNOW YOU TRIED
REALLY, REALLY HARD
ON THIS CHALLENGE,
BUT YOU WERE WAY OFF.
- BEING THE BIG GIRL,
IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT SIZE.
IT'S MORE OF AN ATTITUDE,
AND YOU DIDN'T DELIVER
THE ATTITUDE.
YOU PUT SOME PADDING IN
AND THOUGHT
THAT IT WOULD TRANSLATE,
AND IT DIDN'T.
- THANK YOU, LADIES.
WHILE YOU UNTUCK
IN THE FORMDECOR LOUNGE,
THE JUDGES AND I
WILL DELIBERATE.
ALL RIGHT, NOW, JUST BETWEEN US,
DREAM GIRLS.
- HMM.
- LET'S TALK OFF-BROADWAY.
LET'S START WITH
TRINITY K. BONET.
- DICTION, DICTION, I WANT
TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING!
- NOW, WHEN TRINITY'S IN DRAG,
SHE WEARS TEMPORARY TEETH.
WE CALL THEM FLIPPERS
IN THE BUSINESS.
I'M WONDERING,
COULD THAT BE THE REASON
SHE'S UNABLE
TO PRONOUNCE HER LYRICS?
- FLIPPER OR NO FLIPPER,
YOU'VE GOT TO WORK
WITH WHAT YOU'VE GOT.
- THAT'S TRUE.
- YES.
- AND BE OPEN
TO LISTENING TO SOMEBODY.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GET
ALL "UGH" FACE.
AIN'T NOBODY GOT TIME
FOR THAT.
[LAUGHTER]
- DARIENNE LAKE.
- SHE SEEMED TO GET
A LITTLE BIT
LOST IN THE SAUCE,
WHEREAS GIA,
FOGHORN OR NOT,
WAS GIVING IT ALL
WITH EASE.
DARIENNE DISAPPEARED
FOR ME.
- THE THUNDER FROM DOWN UNDER,
COURTNEY ACT.
- I INSTANTLY WAS TRANSPORTED
INTO A BROADWAY HOUSE.
- YES.
- AND I TOTALLY BOUGHT IT
FROM HEAD TO TOE,
BUT THERE WERE SOME CLUNKERS
THAT SHE HIT.
- I DIDN'T REALLY MIND
ANY OF THE NOTES
THAT MIGHT'VE BEEN
A LITTLE OFF.
SHE REALLY NAILED
THIS PERFORMANCE.
- I LOVED THAT
FRESH-FROM-KANSAS,
FRESH-OFF-THE-BUS
LOOK OF HERS.
SHE WAS FABULOUS.
- BENDELACREME.
- KNEW THE CHOREOGRAPHY,
KNEW ALL THE WORDS,
LOOKED GOOD DOING IT.
- I REALLY LOVE
HER BODY LANGUAGE, AS WELL.
- YOU CAN TELL
BY LOOKING AT HER,
THIS IS HER SHTICK.
- YEAH.
-BUT SHE ONLY TOOK IT
HALFWAY TO TONI BRAXTON.
- [LAUGHS]
- SHE DIDN'T TAKE IT
ALL THE WAY.
- ADORE DELANO.
- ADORE HAS A BEAUTIFUL VOICE,
BUT SHE CAN BE A LITTLE SLOPPY.
- ADORE WAS THE MVP FOR ME.
HER VOICE AND THE TONES
THAT WERE COMING OUT
OF HER MOUTH
MADE ME LOOK AT HER
IN A WHOLE OTHER LIGHT
OF BEING LIKE,
WOW, THIS IS A REAL TALENT.
- LAST BUT NOT LEAST,
APRIL CARRION.
- SHE'S BEAUTIFUL,
AND SHE TRIED REALLY HARD.
UNFORTUNATELY, SHE DID NOT
EMBODY THE BIG GIRL ROLE.
- WELL, THAT'S THE STANDOUT
ROLE OF THAT TRIO.
- YES, IT IS.
- AND IT HAS TO DELIVER.
THAT WAS THE PROBLEM.
- SILENCE,
I'VE MADE MY DECISION,
GUYS AND DOLLS.
NOW, BRING BACK MY GIRLS.
[LAUGHS]
- [LAUGHS]
WELCOME BACK, LADIES.
I'VE MADE SOME DECISIONS.
THE NOMINEES
FOR BEST ACTRESS
IN A RUSICAL ARE...
COURTNEY ACT
AS GOOD PENNY,
BENDELACREME
AS SHADY LADY,
ADORE DELANO
AS BAD PENNY.
MAY I HAVE
THE ENVELOPE, PLEASE?
THE WINNER OF THIS WEEK'S
MAIN CHALLENGE IS...
COURTNEY ACT.
- THANK YOU,
THANK YOU.
AND THANK YOU.
- YOU'VE WON
TWO VIP PACKAGES
FOR THE TONY-WINNING
BROADWAY MUSICAL
"KINKY BOOTS."
- OOH!
- LADIES, YOU MAY JOIN
THE OTHER GIRLS.
DARIENNE LAKE,
YOUR COMEDY QUEEN ROUTINE
DIDN'T REALLY SHTICK
WITH THE JUDGES.
TRINITY K. BONET,
YOUR PAGEANT QUEEN PERFORMANCE
WAS NOT YOUR CROWNING GLORY.
APRIL CARRION,
IN THE ROLE OF THE BIG GIRL,
YOU MAY HAVE BITTEN OFF
MORE THAN YOU COULD CHEW.
DARIENNE LAKE,
YOU ARE SAFE.
YOU MAY JOIN THE OTHER GIRLS.
TRINITY, APRIL,
I'M SORRY, MY DEARS,
BUT YOU ARE UP FOR ELIMINATION.
TWO QUEENS STAND BEFORE ME.
LADIES,
THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE
TO IMPRESS ME
AND SAVE YOURSELF
FROM ELIMINATION.
THE TIME HAS COME
FOR YOU TO LIP-SYNC
FOR YOUR LIFE.
GOOD LUCK,
AND DON'T FUCK IT UP.
- I AM SERVING,
I AM OWNING THAT SONG.
OH, GOSPEL,
OH, CHURCH.
I'M A BRING JESUS,
I'M A BRING ALL THE SAINTS.
- I'M GIVING YOU
A PIECE OF TRINITY.
I'M CHANNELING
MY INNER CHAKA.
I'M GIVING IT ALL I GOT.
- TRINITY IS LIP-SYNCHING
THE HOUSE DOWN WITH BOOTS.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS,
BUT SHE'S DOING IT.
- APRIL IS HUNGRY FOR THIS.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
- NOW, THAT IS WHAT I CALL
A LIP-SYNC.
NOW, I'VE MADE MY DECISION.
TRINITY K. BONET,
SHANTE, YOU STAY.
YOU MAY JOIN THE OTHER GIRLS.
APRIL, MY FIERCE,
BEAUTIFUL QUEEN,
KEEP CALM AND CARRY ON.
NOW, SASHAY AWAY.
- LOVE YOU.
I GAVE MY ALL.
I KNOW RU SAW MY EFFORT
AND JUST MY PASSION.
I WISH I COULD'VE GONE FURTHER
AND JUST BROUGHT THAT CROWN
TO PUERTO RICO,
BUT THIS CAN ONLY
MAKE ME STRONGER.
- MY TOP 10 QUEENS,
HERE'S TO THE LADIES WHO TALK.
IF YOU CAN'T LOVE YOURSELF,
HOW IN THE HELL ARE YOU GONNA
LOVE SOMEBODY ELSE?
CAN I GET A "AMEN" IN HERE?
- AMEN!
- I'LL DRINK TO THAT.


- PREVIOUSLY
ON "RUPAUL'S DRAG RACE"--
IN THE MOST AMBITIOUS CHALLENGE
IN "DRAG RACE" HISTORY,
YOU'LL BE PERFORMING LIVE
IN "SHADE, THE RUSICAL."
- [APPLAUSE]
- I'M A DRAG QUEEN.
I LIP-SYNC,
I DON'T SING LIVE.
- THE WINNER OF THIS WEEK'S
MAIN CHALLENGE IS COURTNEY ACT.
WELL, WHY DO YOU THINK
GIA'S SAFE AND YOU'RE HERE?
- BECAUSE I THINK
I'M ONE OF THE TOP 3.
- TRINITY K. BONET,
SHANTE, YOU STAY.
APRIL, SASHAY AWAY.
- OOH,
THAT WAS A DOOZY, GIRL.
- A DOOZY.
- THAT WAS A LIP SYNC, Y'ALL.
- TRINITY, YOU TURNED IT, BITCH.
CLAP FOR THAT HOOKER.
- WHOO.
- NO MORE AP-R-IL.
IT'S BEEN A REALLY BUMPY ROAD.
BUT I FEEL ACCOMPLISHED,
I'M STILL HERE.
- I'LL NEVER FORGET APRIL.
MY BABY'S DUE IN APRIL.
- OH, GOD.
- REALLY?
- WHEN IT COMES
TO MILK AND HER, UM, FASHION,
I DON'T GET IT.
LIKE, WE'RE PLAYING
MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL,
AND SHE'S PLAYING CHECKERS.
WE'RE NOT
IN THE SAME GAME, HERE.
- DARIENNE, YOU WOULD UP
IN THE BOTTOM 3,
YOU WEREN'T EXPECTING THAT,
WERE YOU?
- I WAS MAD
AS MOTHERFUCKING HELL--
I WAS MAD.
- WHO DO YOU FEEL
SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE?
- MILK, SAFE?
SERIOUSLY?
I WAS GIVING YOU ADELE
GOING TO THE TONYS.
I WAS NOT GIVING YOU
PHYLLIS DILLER
GOING TO THE DELIVERY ROOM.
- GANJ-GANJ,
HOW DO YOU FEEL?
- WELL, UM, MY PARENTS
ACTUALLY CAME UP
ON THE UNTUCKED SCREEN TODAY.
IT WAS JUST KIND
OF A HARD MOMENT,
BECAUSE LIKE,
THE GIRLS JUST, LIKE, KIND OF
JUMPED IN IMMEDIATELY
AND STARTED TALKING OVER ME.
I'M VERY, VERY THANKFUL.
I REALLY DO LOVE THEM,
AND I KNOW
THAT THEY SUPPORT ME 100%.
- I THINK YOUR PARENTS
ARE ABSOLUTELY LOVELY.
THE ONLY THING
I DISAGREE WITH
IS THAT THEY
THINK YOU'RE GOING TO WIN.
- I FEEL HURT THAT YOU GUYS
WOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF THIS MOMENT FOR YOURSELVES,
BECAUSE THIS WAS ABOUT ME.
IT WAS HARD FOR ME,
BECAUSE I NEEDED TO TAKE
THAT MOMENT TO JUST BREATHE,
AND REALLY TAKE IT IN BEFORE
I COULD SPEAK, AND I JUST--
I FELT LIKE I DIDN'T
REALLY GET THAT.
BIANCA'S LIKE,
"WELL I AGREE WITH EVERYTHING,
BUT YOU'RE NOT THE WINNER."
- BITCH, IT WAS A FUCKING JOKE.
TAKE ALL THAT WEEPY BULLSHIT,
TAKE ALL THAT ATTENTION
THAT YOU NEED,
AND APPLY IT TO THE COMPETITION.
OR GET THE FUCK OUT.
NEED HELP PACKING?
BEAT IT, QUEEN.
- THE WINNER
OF "RUPAUL'S DRAG RACE"
RECEIVES A SICKENING SUPPLY
OF COLOREVOLUTION COSMETICS
AND A CASH PRIZE OF $100,000,
WITH EXTRA-SPECIAL GUEST JUDGES
HEATHER MCDONALD
AND GILLIAN JACOBS.
- NOW, SISSY THAT WALK.
- [HUMMING TO RUPAUL'S
"SISSY THAT WALK"]
- SO, IT'S A NEW DAY
IN THE WORKROOM,
AND WE HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT TO EXPECT NEXT.
- GIRL, I'VE GOT TO STRETCH.
LET ME GET UP IN HERE.
- ERYKAH BA-DON'T.
[LAUGHTER]
OF COURSE, MISS ATTENTION WHORE,
WEEPING WILLOW,
IS WEARING A MACRAME POTHOLDER
ON HER GODDAMN HEAD,
BECAUSE CLEARLY
SHE NEEDS MORE ATTENTION.
- WELL GIRL,
I'M YOUNG AND HUNG,
AND CLEARLY MARCH
TO THE SOUND OF MY OWN DRUM,
SO, PROPS TO YOU, MAMA.
- WAIT, WHERE DID
THAT COME FROM?
- DID YOU JUST GET OUT
OF THE SHOWER?
- I GUESS THE QUESTION IS,
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE PLANT
THAT WAS IN IT, HANGING IN
YOUR HOTEL ROOM EARLIER.
- OH GIRL, I SMOKED THAT PLANT,
TRUST AND BELIEVE, MAMA!
- THAT WOULD EXPLAIN
THE FASHION CHOICE.
- WELL, AT LEAST I'VE GOT
SOME FASHION GOING ON.
- OH, SURE GIRL.
- MISS BIANCA,
OLD AND WISE,
AND YET, SO FULL OF SHIT.
[SIREN WAILS]
- OHH!
- NICE SHE-MAIL FOR THE HE-MALE.
- WHAT NOW?
- OOH, GIRL,
YOU GOT SHE-MAIL.
CALLING ALL THE BASIC RACERS.
CALLING ALL THE BASIC RACERS.
THERE IS A NEW ANNOUNCEMENT.
YOU'RE BASIC.
- [LAUGHS]
- AND AIN'T NOBODY
GOT TIME FOR THAT.
- OH BOY.
- OHH.
- HELLO, HELLO, HELLO!
- HI!
- LOOK AT YOU.
NOW, LADIES,
THIS WEEK'S MAIN CHALLENGE
IS GOING TO BE PACKED
WITH MORE STARS
THAN THERE ARE IN HEAVEN.
WHO'S COMING?
WELL, YOU'LL HAVE TO TELL ME,
BECAUSE IT'S TIME TO PLAY...
SNATCH GAME!
- OH, MY GOSH.
- I AM SO FUCKING EXCITED.
THIS IS THE REASON
I CAME INTO THIS COMPETITION,
IS TO SNATCH
SNATCH GAME,
SNATCH THE TITLE.
- NOW, YOU'LL NEED TO BUST OUT
YOUR BEST CELEBRITY
IMPERSONATION.
GENTLEMEN, START YOUR ENGINES,
AND MAY THE BEST WOMAN WIN.
- SNATCH GAME IS A REALLY
IMPORTANT CHALLENGE.
IT'S ONE THAT EVERYBODY
KNOWS IS COMING,
AND EVERYBODY'S KIND OF WAITING
ALL SEASON
TO SEE WHAT YOU PULL OUT.
BUT I DON'T DO IMPERSONATIONS--
THAT'S NOT EVER PART OF MY DEAL.
- THIS CHALLENGE IS THE ONE
THAT'S GOING TO SEPARATE
THE TALENTED
FROM THE OTHER ONES.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING THERE, HON?
- TERESA GIUDICE, FROM JERSEY.
- WHO ARE YOU DOING, BABY?
- I'M GOING TO BE RACHEL ZOE.
- I COULD SEE THAT.
- YOU KNOW, WHEN TAY-TAY
WAS HER ASSISTANT,
BEFORE SHE TURNED BITCH.
I THINK THE KEY
TO A GOOD IMPERSONATION
IS NOT ONLY LOOKING
LIKE THE CHARACTER,
BUT SPEAKING IN THEIR VOICE.
[IMITATING RACHEL ZOE]
IT'S MAJ.
I'M NOT WORRIED.
- AND WHO ARE YOU DOING,
MISS BIANCA DEL RIO?
- CAN YOU TELL
FROM THIS HAIRDO?
- LET'S GUESS.
- SHE'S MY FAVORITE PERSON
IN THE WORLD.
- I'M JUST GOING TO GO
WITH JUDGE JUDY.
- JUDGE JUDY,
DING, DING, DING!
I LOVE HER.
I WANT TO BE HER.
THE REASON WHY
I'M CHOOSING JUDGE JUDY
IS BECAUSE SHE'S SMART,
SHE'S SENSIBLE,
AND SHE'S A FUCKING BITCH.
I LOVE HER.
I--I WATCH HER ALL THE TIME
BECAUSE SHE MAKES ME LAUGH.
- AND RUPAUL LOVES HER SO MUCH.
- OH SHE DOES?
- YEAH.
- SO, I HAVE NO IDEA
THAT "JUDGE JUDY"
IS RUPAUL'S FAVORITE TV SHOW.
HEH--PRESSURE?
SO, IT EITHER COULD BE
REALLY GOOD OR A HOT MESS.
- YEAH, YOU COULD FALL FLAT
ON YOUR FACE AND GO HOME.
- [CHUCKLES SARCASTICALLY]
- BIANCA IS
A LITTLE BIT STRESSED.
I HAVEN'T SEEN HER
AT ALL SWEAT IN THE COMPETITION,
AND IT'S INTERESTING
SEEING HER KIND OF
WRIGGLE A LITTLE.
- HELLO, HELLO, HELLO!
- HI!
- HELLO!
- NO MORE FUN AND GAMES
OF THE MIND.
ADORE DELANO, DARLING.
- HI, RU.
- OKAY, THAT IS A BLONDE WIG.
- YEAH,
I'M DOING ANNA NICOLE SMITH.
- ANNA NICOLE SMITH!
- I LOVE HER.
LIKE, KIDS HAD SPICE GIRLS
ON THEIR FOLDERS,
AND I LITERALLY WOULD HAVE,
LIKE, THE "PLAYBOY" CUTOUT,
BECAUSE I WOULD STEAL IT--
NO, REALLY.
I THINK I IDENTIFIED
WITH THE FACT
THAT SHE WAS JUST VERY CRAZY,
AND SHE INSPIRES ADORE
A LOT, TOO.
- CAN YOU DO A SOUTHERN ACCENT
LIKE HER?
- I CAN!
- LET ME HEAR IT.
[IMITATING ANNA NICOLE SMITH]
- I WAS HONORED TO BE IN
OUR NEXT PERFORMER'S NEW VIDEO,
AND IF I EVER RECORD AN ALBUM,
I'D WANT THIS GUY
TO PRODUCE MINE,
BECAUSE HE'S FREAKING GENIUS.
I WOULD REALLY BE LETTING
DANNIELYNN DOWN
IF I DID NOT WIN THIS CHALLENGE.
- DELA.
- HI, RU.
- IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE
DOING SOMEONE OLDER.
- IT IS.
I WILL BE DOING
MAGGIE SMITH.
- "DOWNTON ABBEY" MAGGIE SMITH.
- YES, YES.
- HOW WILL YOU MAKE
MAGGIE SMITH FUNNY?
- WELL, I THINK MAGGIE SMITH
IS ALREADY SUCH A CHARACTER.
- HMM.
- AND JUST, SORT OF, SHE'S BEEN
IN THE BUSINESS SO LONG.
- YEAH.
NOW, YOU DO AN ENGLISH ACCENT?
- UM, YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO DO ONE, IF I'M HONEST.
- WHAT OTHER CHOICES
WERE YOU MULLING OVER
BEFORE YOU SETTLED
ON MAGGIE SMITH?
- UM, WELL,
I WAS INITIALLY THINKING
ABOUT ONE OF MY FAVORITE QUEENS
FROM LAST SEASON,
MISS ALYSSA EDWARDS.
- CAN I SEE A LITTLE BIT
OF YOUR ALYSSA EDWARDS?
G--
[GAGGING]
- WOW. ALL RIGHT.
WELL, YOU'VE GOT
A LOT OF COMPETITION.
THERE ARE VERY
TALENTED GIRLS HERE.
- RU DOES NOT SEEM INTO MY IDEA.
I'M SHAKEN--MY CONFIDENCE
IS DEFINITELY SHAKEN, BUT, I--
- COMING UP--
- I'D RATHER YOU HAVE
LOW EXPECTATIONS
SO I CAN BLOW YOU AWAY.
- WELL, YOU'VE SUCCEEDED.
- AAH!
- [LAUGHS]
- [LAUGHS]
- TODAY'S CHALLENGE
IS THE SNATCH GAME,
WHERE YOU IMPERSONATE ONE
OF YOUR FAVORITE CELEBRITIES.
- LAGANJA GIRL.
- HEY, MAMA RU.
- AND WHAT'S WITH THIS HEADPIECE
YOU HAVE ON?
- OH, THIS OLD THING?
- [LAUGHS]
SO, WHO ARE YOU GOING TO DO?
- I'M GOING TO BE PLAYING
RACHEL ZOE.
[IMITATING RACHEL ZOE]
SHE'S BANANAS!
- [LAUGHS]
I KNOW SHE'S GOT
SOME KEY PHRASING--
"LIT-ER-AL-LY."
- AND "I DIE,"
AND "MAJ!"
- NOW, ARE YOU QUICK
ON YOUR TOES?
- I'M VERY QUICK ON MY TOES,
AND I MUST SAY, YOUR OUTFIT
IS JUST TO DIE FOR.
- LITERALLY?
- LITERALLY.
- [LAUGHS]
ALL RIGHT, GET BACK TO WORK.
- THANKS, RU.
- WELL, HELLO, MILK.
- HI!
- WHO ARE YOU GOING TO DO?
- THE CHEF THAT BROUGHT
FRENCH COOKING
TO THE AMERICAN KITCHEN,
JULIA CHILD.
- OH, WOW.
SO, HOW ARE YOU GOING
TO MAKE HER FUNNY?
- UM, SHE'S ALREADY
OVER THE TOP
BECAUSE OF HER SIZE,
BUT I'M GOING TO BRING
THAT OVER-THE-TOP
SORT OF PERSONALITY,
THAT IF SHE WROTE
A 730-PAGE BOOK
ABOUT FRENCH COOKING, AND--
I MEAN, SO--
I MEAN, SHE'S A SMART GIRL.
- HAVE YOU SEEN SNATCH GAME
ON OUR SHOW?
- WHAT SHOW?
I'D RATHER YOU HAVE
LOW EXPECTATIONS
SO I CAN BLOW YOU AWAY.
- WELL, YOU'VE SUCCEEDED.
- WELL, WELL, WELL,
BIANCA DEL RIO.
- HELLO, MR. RUPAUL.
- OH MY GOODNESS, I JUST SAW
THE JUDGE'S ROBE RIGHT THERE.
- YEAH.
- OH MY GOD.
JUDGE JUDY.
- JUDGE JUDY!
- ONLY JUDY CAN JUDGE ME.
- EXACTLY.
[LAUGHTER]
AND I'M SURE SHE WOULD!
- YOU KNOW HOW I LOVE--
- I--I JUST FOUND OUT
THAT YOU ACTUALLY LOVE HER.
- I GOT TO TELL YOU,
I WATCH "JUDGE JUDY"
EVERY SINGLE DAY--
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
- I'VE SEEN EVERY EPISODE.
SO, YOU KNOW, THE HEAT IS ON YOU
TO PULL THIS OFF.
YOU'D BETTER
DO MY JUDGE JUDY PROUD.
- FUCK!
- G-G-G-GIA!
- HI, RU.
- NOW, YOU KNOW SNATCH GAME?
- YES.
- HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DO?
- WELL, NOT ONLY BE SNATCHED--
- UH-HUH.
BUT I'M GOING TO DO SELENA.
- SELENA?
- YES.
- NOT SELENA GOMEZ?
- NO, QUINTANILLA.
- SO--
- A LITTLE BEE-DEE, BEE-DEE.
- IS SHE FUNNY, THOUGH?
I MEAN, HOW ARE YOU GOING
TO MAKE HER FUNNY?
- SO, YOU KNOW, SHE CRACKED,
LIKE, A FEW JOKES
HERE AND THERE.
BUT ALSO, YOU KNOW,
REFERRING TO OTHER THINGS.
I JUST--YOU KNOW,
I'M VERY FLAPPY AT THE JAW,
I'M VERY USED TO,
LIKE, YOU KNOW,
COMING BACK WITH READS, AND--
- I'M NOT BUYING THIS, GIA.
I'M NOT BUYING IT.
GIVE ME A LITTLE SELENA.
CAN YOU GIVE ME A LITTLE SELENA?
- UH-HUH.
"HOLA, TIENEN PREGUNTAS?"
- OKAY.
- GIRL, SELENA--WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO WITH THAT?
I LOVE PIZZA,
I GOT SHOT BY YOLANDA--
LIKE, WHAT'S FUNNY?
LIKE, IT'S THE TRUTH, GIRL!
- ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
GATHER AROUND.
NOW, TOMORROW,
ON THE MAIN STAGE,
THERE'S JUST ONE MORE CELEBRITY
YOU'LL NEED TO CHANNEL.
ME!
CATEGORY IS
"NIGHT OF A THOUSAND RUS."
- [APPLAUSE]
[LAUGHTER]
GOOD LUCK,
AND YOU BETTER WORK.
- [APPLAUSE]
- SUPERMODEL!
- ARE YOU STILL DOING SELENA?
- I'M NOT SURE.
I HAD THE SELENA COSTUME
READY ON MY MANNEQUIN,
BUT I'M NOW PROCESSING
RU'S COMMENTS,
AND KIND OF NOW THINKING
MAYBE THIS ISN'T
THE BEST CHOICE.
- WHO ELSE ARE YOU
THINKING ABOUT?
- BUT YOU'RE PLANNING
ON CHANGING IT?
- I MEAN, I'M THINKING ABOUT IT.
- CAN YOU CHANGE IT?
- YEAH.
- SO, GIA'S PUTTING ON MAKEUP,
AND DON'T KNOW WHO THE FUCK
SHE'S GONNA BE.
HOW THAT WORK?
- WELCOME TO A SUPER-SIZE
EDITION OF SNATCH GAME.
LET'S MEET OUR CONTESTANTS.
COMEDIENNE, AUTHOR,

HEATHER MCDONALD IS HERE!
[APPLAUSE]

- YES.
- GOOD.
ORDER IN THE COURTROOM, HUNTY,
IT'S JUDGE JUDY.
HEY, YOUR HONOR.
- DID YOU FORGET YOU WERE COMING
TO COURT TODAY
DRESSED LIKE THAT?
YOU LOOK LIKE
A DAMN ROLL OF SCOTCH TAPE.
- WELL, I THOUGHT IT WAS--
- DON'T PISS ON MY LEG
AND TELL ME IT'S RAINING.
[LAUGHTER]
- UP NEXT, "PLAYBOY" PLAYMATE
AND REALITY TV PIONEER,
ANNA NICOLE SMITH IS HERE.
- LIKE MY BODY?
- YEAH.

WANT A VIPER?
- I'VE GOT TO SAY,
DEATH REALLY BECOMES HER.
[LAUGHTER]
UP NEXT, IT'S THE FRENCH CHEF,
JULIA CHILD.
- OH, HELLO, RU,
HOW ARE YOU?
- I HOPE YOU'VE GOT
SOMETHING COOKING.
DID YOU BRING YOUR LOVIN' OVEN?
- I SURE DID.
IT'S RIGHT UNDER THIS DESK!
- ALL RIGHT.
MOVING ON DOWN
TO THE FIRST LADY OF QUEENS,
FRAN DRESCHER IS HERE.
- ARE YOU SINGLE MR. RUPAUL?
- I AM SINGLE, YES.
- BECAUSE YOU KNOW,
MY GIRLFRIEND, VAL,
EVER SINCE OBAMA GOT INTO POWER,
SHE'S BEEN LOCO FOR THE COCOA.
[LAUGHTER]
- STYLIST TO THE STARS,
RACHEL ZOE IS HERE!
- MIGHT I SAY I LITERALLY
DIE FOR YOUR OUTFIT.
- IS THAT REAL FUR
YOU'RE WEARING?
- IT'S MY NEW FUR FAUX LINE.
- ALL RIGHT, UP NEXT,
THE QUEEN OF SOUTHERN CUISINE,
MISS PAULA DEEN IS HERE!
- MY, YOU GORGEOUS
BALD-HEADED MAN.
- OH, YOU SWEET THING.
- WELL, JUST BECAUSE
YOU'RE LOSING YOUR FUZZ
DON'T MEAN YOU AIN'T
A PEACH, HONEY.
[LAUGHS]
WHAT DID SHE JUST CALL ME?
MEDIA SENSATION
KIM KARDASHIAN IS HERE.
HOW'S THE BABY?
- OH, YOU KNOW,
I'M STILL, LIKE,
HAVING SOME MORNING-AFTER--
IS THAT--
YES, YOU KNOW, LIKE,
THROWING UP AND STUFF
AFTER THE PREGNANCY,
BUT EVERYTHING SHOULD BE OKAY.
- KIM, YOU LOOK GORGEOUS.
- ABSOLUTELY.
- AND LOOK WHO'S HERE.
IT'S TERESA FROM "THE REAL
HOUSEWIVES OF NEW JERSEY."
HEY, GIRL.
- DO YOU KNOW HOW
TO PRONOUNCE MY LAST NAME?
- I DON'T,
I HAD A HARD TIME WITH IT.
- WELL, IT WAS JOO-DICE--
- UH-HUH.
- AND THEN, I REALIZED
IT WAS JOO-DEE-CHAY.
- UH-HUH.
- BUT WE WENT
ALL THE WAY BACK
TO THE OLD COUNTRY,
AND IT'S ACTUALLY PRONOUNCED--
LET ME SEE IF I CAN GET IT.
JOHNSON.
[LAUGHTER]
- TERESA JOHNSON, EVERYBODY.
OKAY, WE HAVE TWO-TIME
ACADEMY AWARD-WINNING ACTRESS,
DAME MAGGIE SMITH IS WITH US.
HOW ARE YOU, MY DEAR?
- WELL, PAST A CERTAIN AGE,
ONE JUST FEELS FORTUNATE
TO SEE THE SUN RISE ANOTHER DAY.
- YES, YES, MAGGIE SMITH.

MR. CHARLES AND DAME SMITH,
SHALL WE?
- YES, MA'AM.
- THANK YOU.
- NOW, EVERYONE'S FAVORITE
PINK LADY,
NICKI MINAJ IS HERE.
- O-M-G. HI, RU.
- HAVE YOU HEARD
FROM MARIAH AT ALL?
[LAUGHTER]
- NO.

ARE YOU READY
TO PLAY THE SNATCH GAME?
- OH, SHIT,
IT'S THE SNATCH GAME.
AAH!
- COMING UP--
- I'M SWEATING LIKE TWO RATS
HUMPING IN A WOOL SOCK,
RIGHT NOW.
[LAUGHTER]
- NOT A MATCH, YOUR HONOR.
- BALONEY!
- THAT'S REALLY RUDE.
- I'M TALKING!
- [LAUGHS]
- [LAUGHS]
WELCOME BACK TO SNATCH GAME.
NOW, HERE'S HOW
THE GAME WORKS, LADIES.
I ASK A QUESTION,
OUR CELEBRITY CONTESTANTS
FILL IN THE BLANKS,
AND YOU GIVE AN ANSWER
THAT YOU THINK WILL MATCH.
FIRST UP, HEATHER MCDONALD.
CHER IS COMPLETELY ADDICTED
TO SOCIAL MEDIA.
EVEN HER "BLANK"
HAS A TWITTER ACCOUNT.
- I SAID, "EVEN HER WIG
HAS A TWITTER ACCOUNT."
- LET'S GO TO THE STARS
AND FIND OUT
WHAT THEY WROTE DOWN.
JUDGE JUDY.
- HER OLD NOSE.
- NOT A MATCH,
UNFORTUNATELY, BUT--
- SHE--IT HAS BEEN
LIKE 3 OR 4.
- YEAH, SHE'S BEEN TOUCHED
BY AN ANGEL.
- YEAH.
- AND SHE LOOKS GREAT.
- I AGREE, AND YOU KNOW,
I AGREE,
AND SO DOES OFFICER BYRD.
[IMITATING BYRD]
THAT IS CORRECT, JUDGE JUDY.
- NOT A MATCH, YOUR HONOR.
- BALONEY.
[LAUGHTER]
BALONEY, SIR.
- I'M READY FOR A FRIED BOLOGNA
SANDWICH, MYSELF.
- LET'S MOVE ON DOWN
TO ANNA NICOLE SMITH.
- I SEE THAT HER HAIR
CHANGES ALL THE TIME.
- YES, IT DOES.
- AND IT HAS, LIKE,
A MIND OF ITS OWN.
- YES, IT DOES.
- SO, I PUT "HAIR,"
AND I THINK I WON SOMETHING.
- YES. YES, YOU DID.
[LAUGHTER]
- THAT'S A MATCH.
- YES.
- WHAT DO I WIN?
- WELL, WE'LL TELL YOU
IN A MINUTE, ANNA NICOLE.
- OKAY.
- LET'S MOVE ON DOWN
TO RACHEL ZOE.
- I WROTE "SHOES,"
BECAUSE SHOES
ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT ACCESSORY
TO A WOMEN'S OUTFIT.
AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE ME,
RACHEL ZOE,
TO GET YOUR SHOES STYLED.
- UH, RU?
- YES?
- IS THIS GIRL
OVER THERE A ROBOT?
WHY DOES SHE SOUND LIKE THAT?
IS SOMEBODY PUSHING A BUTTON?
CAN YOU TALK NORMAL?
- I'M ACTUALLY OVERWORKED--
- I'M TALKING, I'M TALKING!
AND, UM, I THINK
THAT'S REALLY RUDE.
- IS THAT REALLY
HOW RACHEL ZOE TALKS?
NO? OH...
THAT'S UNFORTUNATE.
- ALL RIGHT, DAME MAGGIE SMITH,
CHER, COMPLETELY ADDICTED
TO SOCIAL MEDIA,
EVEN HER "BLANK"
HAS A TWITTER ACCOUNT.
- WELL, RUPLE--RUPLE, IS IT?
- YES, ABSOLUTELY.
- I UNDERSTOOD VIRTUALLY
NONE OF THE WORDS
THAT LEFT YOUR LIPS
MOMENTS AGO,
BUT I DID HEAR
THE TERM "TWITTER,"
AND I ASSUME THAT IT'S
SOME SORT OF SONGBIRD?
- VERY CLOSE, NOT A MATCH.
- AM I TO UNDERSTAND
THAT ONE YANKS ONE'S TELEPHONE
RIGHT OUT OF THE WALLS
AND CARRIES IT WITH HIM?
[LAUGHTER]
- YES.
- RU, COULD YOU GET PEOPLE
THAT SPEAK NORMAL ENGLISH
NEXT TIME FOR THE SHOW?
- EXCUSE ME,
WE ORIGINATED THE LANGUAGE!
[LAUGHTER]
- OH, OKAY.
- ALL RIGHT, UP NEXT,
GILLIAN JACOBS.
THE CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO
IS SO GAY,
INSTEAD OF HORSES,
THEIR MOUNTED POLICE
RIDE "BLANK."
- I SAID, "BEARS."
- WHY NOT RIDE A BEAR?
- I KNOW YOU LIKE A BEAR.
- I LOVE A BEAR.
- I'M SWEATING
LIKE TWO RATS
HUMPING IN A WOOL SOCK,
RIGHT NOW.
- OH, DEAR.
- OH MY.
- LET'S SEE
IF YOU GOT ANY MATCHES
WITH OUR STARS.
JULIA CHILD.
- I HAD ALWAYS HEARD
THAT SAN FRANCISCO WAS--
THERE WAS A SAUSAGE FEST
ALL YEAR ROUND.
- YEAR-ROUND.
- AND SO, THEY MUST HAVE
ALL THESE TRUCKS
TO DELIVER THESE SAUSAGES.
- I'M SURE THEY MUST, YES.
- AND SO, I SAY,
"SAUSAGE TRUCKS."
- MILK AIN'T NO MERYL STREEP.
- ALL RIGHT, KIM KARDASHIAN,
SAN FRANCISCO IS SO GAY,
INSTEAD OF HORSES,
THE MOUNTED POLICE RIDE--
- WELL, LIKE I ALWAYS SAY,
YOU NEVER PUT A TATTOO
ON A BENTLEY,
AND I HOPE THAT I--
- A BENTLEY.
- SPELLED IT RIGHT.
- YOU PROBABLY DIDN'T.
- BEAUTY FADES,
DUMB IS FOREVER.
- UP NEXT,
WE'VE GOT TERESA
FROM "THE REAL HOUSEWIVES
OF NEW JERSEY."
WHAT DO THEY RIDE?
- PROSTITUTION WHORSES.
- PROSTITUTION WHORSES.
UNFORTUNATELY, NOT A MATCH.
- CAN I HAVE A PINOT GRIGIO?
- PINOT GRIGIO, COMING RIGHT UP.
ALL RIGHT, NICKI MINAJ,
OH MY GOODNESS,
YOU'VE GOT A HAIRSTYLE CHANGE.
- YES.
- LOVE IT, THAT'S GORGEOUS.
- I DIDN'T GET A CHANCE
TO WRITE ANYTHING DOWN
BECAUSE I WAS TRYING
TO CHANGE MY WIG.
- OH, OKAY.
- WIG CHANGES.
- HOW ORIGINAL.
CHAD MICHAELS,
HOW MANY YEARS AGO?
- YOU DIDN'T
WRITE DOWN ANYTHING?
- NO.
- PERHAPS SHE NEEDS ANOTHER POT
OF INK TO REPLENISH HER QUILL.
[LAUGHTER]
- ALL RIGHT, HEATHER.
THAT CHELSEA HANDLER
IS SO WRONG.
SHE'S LAUNCHING A NEW VODKA.
IT'S FLAVORED WITH "BLANK."
- XANAX.
- XANAX. WHAT A GREAT IDEA!
OKAY, LET'S GO ON OVER
TO ANNA NICOLE SMITH
TO SEE IF SHE MATCHED YOU.
- WELL, I'M NOT REALLY
A DRINKER.
- RIGHT.
- BUT I'VE TASTED VODKA
A COUPLE OF TIMES
IN MY LIFE,
AND I LIKE IT BY ITSELF.
- [LAUGHS]
- SO, I JUST PUT "VODKA."
- UNFORTUNATELY,
IT'S NOT MATCH,
BUT THAT'S A GOOD ANSWER,
ANNA NICOLE.
- KIMMY!
[LAUGHTER]
- FRAN DRESCHER.
CHELSEA HANDLER'S LAUNCHING
A NEW VODKA FLAVORED WITH...
- I SAID "ALCOHOL."
[LAUGHS]
- I KNOW I CAN DO A BETTER
FRAN DRESCHER THAN COURTNEY.
OH, MR. SHEFFIELD.
HA HA HA HA.
- LET'S MOVE
ON TO KIM KARDASHIAN.
- NEW VODKA,
FLAVORED WITH "BLANK."
- I'D HAVE TO GO
WITH "BIG BLACK"--
- KARDASHIAN,
YOU WANT TO DATE HIM?
- YES, DEAR?
OH!
- SHE'S A REAL KEEPER,
AS IN "KEEP 'ER IN A CAGE."
- ALL RIGHT, TERESA,
IT'S FLAVORED WITH "BLANK."
- CUMM-IN.
- OH, YOU MEAN CUMIN.
- CUMM-IN.
- YEAH, IT'S PRONOUNCED
"CUE-MIN."
- CUMM-IN.
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
LET'S MOVE ON DOWN
TO DAME MAGGIE SMITH.
- WELL, I'M UNFAMILIAR
WITH THE WORK OF LADY HANDLER,
HOWEVER, I DID THINK THAT
IT WOULD BE RATHER AMUSING
IF THERE WERE LIBATIONS
FLAVORED WITH CITRUS.
[LAUGHTER]
CAN YOU IMAGINE SUCH A THING?
- THAT IS REALLY NEWFANGLED.
I CAN'T IMAGINE SUCH A THING.
- YES.
[LAUGHTER]
- OH, I'M SORRY,
TIME IS UP,
WHICH MEANS,
OUR WINNER IS...
WHO CARES?
THIS IS RUPAUL REMINDING YOU
TO SPAY AND NEUTER
YOUR FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS.
THANKS FOR WATCHING.
SAY "GOOD-BYE," STARS.
- BYE!
- Y'ALL COME BACK, NOW,
YOU HEAR?
- COMING UP--
SHE WAS REALLY CHANNELING HER.
- IT WAS A PERFECT CHOICE
FOR HER.
- IT'S THE TIGHTEST
SNATCH GAME IN HISTORY.
[LAUGHTER]
- [LAUGHS]
- [LAUGHS]
- MEOW.
- TONIGHT'S RUNWAY THEME
IS "NIGHT OF A THOUSAND RUS."
WE HAVE TO DRESS UP AS RUPAUL,
WHICH IS EXCITING,
BUT RUPAUL
IS GOING TO BE IN THE ROOM, SO--
- AM I THE ONLY ONE
THAT'S, LIKE,
HAVING A PROBLEM
WITH, LIKE, MY BODY?
MY FRIENDS AND I KID AROUND
ABOUT, LIKE--
WE CALL IT "HOG BODY."
JUST, LIKE, WE'RE REALLY THICK
IN THE MIDSECTION.
- DO YOU FEEL OVERWEIGHT?
- I JUST FEEL LIKE I HAVE
A WEIRD-PROPORTIONED BODY.
- WELL MAYBE YOU DO.
AND SO WHAT?
- YEAH.
I HAVE LOTS TO SAY ABOUT WEIGHT.
I WAS VERY HEAVY
ALL THROUGH MIDDLE SCHOOL.
AND I WAS TEASED MERCILESSLY
ABOUT IT,
FOR BEING GAY AND BEING FAT.
IT AFFECTED MY SELF-CONFIDENCE
SO PROFOUNDLY.
I JUST FELT COMPLETELY UNLOVABLE
FOR SO MANY YEARS
BECAUSE OF THAT.
MY MOM, SHE'D BEEN
SORT OF THE BIG PROPONENT
OF ME BEING MYSELF,
AND THAT I WAS BEAUTIFUL.
AND THEN, WHEN I WAS 13,
MY MOM DIED.
I JUST--
THAT REALLY THREW ME
INTO A TAILSPIN.
I DIDN'T HAVE THAT VOICE SAYING
THAT WHO I WAS WAS OKAY ANYMORE.
I JUST HAD A LOT OF VOICES
AT SCHOOL
SAYING THAT EVERYTHING
ABOUT ME WAS WRONG.
TOO FAT, TOO GAY, TOO WEIRD.
SOMETHING THAT I NEVER EXPECTED
TO HAPPEN
WAS THAT I LEARNED A LOT
FROM MY DRAG CHARACTER
THAT I COULD BRING
TO MY BOY SELF.
- RIGHT.
- I HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN
ANYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED TO ME
IN THOSE YEARS,
BUT I HAVE LEARNED
TO USE THE HARDSHIP
TO GET STRONGER.
- ADORE.
- YES, BABY?
- IF YOU DON'T WANT TO GET
YELLED AT BY MICHELLE,
BECAUSE DIDN'T
SHE SAY LAST TIME
THAT YOU NEEDED TO BE CINCHED?
- YEAH.
- I, AND DON'T TELL ANYBODY
THAT I'M BEING KIND,
BUT I HAVE ANOTHER CINCHER
IF YOU WANT ME
TO LACE YOU IN IT.
- I'M DOWN.
- OKAY, WE'LL DO IT.
- I'M REALLY GRATEFUL
FOR BIANCA'S
MOTHERLY KIND OF INSTINCT.
SHE'S KIND OF
MY STEPMOM, RIGHT NOW.
[LAUGHING]
I'M A FOSTER CHILD.
[APPLAUSE]
- WELCOME TO THE MAIN STAGE
OF "RUPAUL'S DRAG RACE."
MICHELLE VISAGE, YOU'VE NEVER
LOOKED SO BEAUTIFUL.
- [LAUGHS]
- SANTINO RICE,
IF YOU LOOKED ANY BETTER,
I'D HAVE TO "BLANK" YOU.
[LAUGHTER]
FUNNY LADY, HEATHER MCDONALD,
DID MY QUEEN
SNATCH YOUR ATTENTION?
- YES, AND YOU LOOK STUNNING.
- THANK YOU.
AND SUPERFAN GILLIAN JACOBS.
- I'M GAGGING ON YOUR ELEGANZA.
[LAUGHTER]
- THIS WEEK,
MY QUEENS WERE CHALLENGED
TO SERVE UP THEIR FIERCEST
CELEBRITY IMPERSONATIONS,
AND TONIGHT,
THE CATEGORY IS ME.
GENTLEMEN, START YOUR ENGINES,
AND MAY THE BEST WOMAN WIN.
FIRST UP, JOSLYN FOX.
YES, MAMA.
- SERVING SLIT.
- GIRL, WHY IT GOTTA BE BLACK?
- I'M SERVING EVENING,
GLAM RUPAUL.
I'M FEELING FABULOUS,
FISHY, AND FIERCE.
- I LIKE THE LITTLE SWIVEL
SHE DOES WITH HER ARMS.
- I THINK, HEATHER,
SHE JUST PASSED GAS.
[LAUGHTER]
NEXT UP, GIA GUNN.
- BITCH STOLE YOUR LOOK.
- THAT'S MY DRESS.
[LAUGHTER]
- I'M SERVING MY RUPAUL GOWN
THAT IS VERY ICONIC,
AND I'M EATING IT UP.
- AND THIS IS THE BACK.
- I LOVE A NUDE ILLUSION.
- DIP INTO THE WATERS
OF DARIENNE LAKE.
- OHH.
- RAWR.
- THE MASQUERADE BALL.
- YES, ALL-STAR.
- I'M GIVING RUPAUL,
MY VERSION OF HER RUNWAY WALK
AS "GIRTHA" KITT.
GRR.
- EYES WIDE SHUT,
LEGS WIDE OPEN.
[LAUGHTER]
- LAGANJA ESTRANJA.
- UH-OH.
- WHOO.
WELCOME TO MY STRATOSPHERE.
- FEMBOTS HAVE FEELINGS, TOO.
[LAUGHTER]
- I AM SERVING SEASON 4
START YOUR ENGINES MAMA RU,
AND I'M FEELING IT, GIRL.
I'M PLUMMETING THE RUNWAY
AND DROPPING IT LIKE IT'S HOT.
- SUCH A GOOD BODY.
I WISH HER HAIR WAS FULLER,
THAT'S THE ONLY THING.
[LAUGHTER]
- BIANCA DEL RIO, COVER GIRL.
LOOKING GOOD,
FEELING GORGEOUS.
- I AM SERVING
AGE-APPROPRIATE RU.
I'M GIVING RU REALNESS NOW,
AND I'M FEELING GOOD!
- SHE SPARKLES
JUST LIKE A CABLEACE AWARD.
[LAUGHTER]
ADORE DELANO.
GLAMAZON!
SUPERSTAR.
- WHAT I'M DOING
IS ADORE DELANO,
INSPIRED BY RUPAUL.
AND I'M SHOWING
MY BRAND NEW CINCHED WAIST.
I LOOK FUCKING COOL!
- SHE'S CINCHED FOR THE GODS.
WORK THAT BODY, WORK THAT BODY.
TRINITY K. BONET.
FOXY LADY, OUT OF SIGHT.
GET YOUR REBEL ON, GIRL.
- I AM SERVING UP
ILLUSION OF RUPAUL,
AND I LOOK ABSOLUTELY AMAZING.
- BIRDS OF A FEATHER.
- I DIDN'T KNOW THAT BIRDS
CAME IN THAT COLOR.
- [LAUGHS]
- WORK IT, MAMA, WORK.
UP NEXT, BENDELACREME.
WAIT A MINUTE, THAT IS MY DRESS!
[LAUGHTER]
- I'M GIVING
SOME CONTEMPORARY RUPAUL.
I'M WORKING THAT RUNWAY,
I FEEL GREAT IN MY DRESS.
- THIS IS LIKE IDENTITY THEFT.
FIRST SHE STEALS
MICHELLE'S IDENTITY,
NOW, SHE STEALS MINE.
YOU'LL BE HEARING
FROM MY LAWYER!
[LAUGHTER]
THUNDER FROM DOWN UNDER,
COURTNEY ACT.
OH MY GOODNESS.
- I MEAN, THE LEGS
ARE THE BEST LEGS
I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE.
- OH, WAIT, HOLD UP, NOW,
WAIT A MINUTE.
- BESIDES YOU, BESIDES YOU.
- I AM POSSESSED
BY THE SPIRIT OF RUPAUL,
AND I CAN HEAR RU'S VOICE
IN MY HEAD SAYING,
"SUPERMODEL OF THE WORLD."
- I WORE THIS OUTFIT
TO THE VH1 FASHION AWARDS.
- YES, YOU DID.
- BOB MACKIE.
MILK.
- OH!
- HELLO, HELLO, HELLO,
IT'S WORKROOM RU.
NO ONE HAS EVER SEEN THIS
ON THE RUNWAY.
I AM WORKING MY ASCOT OFF.
- IS THAT
A KLEIN EPSTEIN PARKER SUIT?
LADY LOOKS LIKE A DUDE.
- COMING UP--
A LOT COULD BE FORGIVEN
IF YOU WERE FUNNY,
BUT YOU WERE NOT FUNNY.
- I AM EXTREMELY OFFENDED
THAT YOU WOULD COME OUT
ON THE RUNWAY IN PANTS.
- [LAUGHS]
- [LAUGHS]
WELCOME, LADIES.
I'VE MADE SOME DECISIONS.
COURTNEY ACT.
DARIENNE LAKE.
JOSLYN FOX.
TRINITY K. BONET.
YOU'RE SAFE.
YOU MAY LEAVE THE STAGE.
LADIES, IT'S TIME
FOR THE JUDGES' CRITIQUES.
LET'S START WITH GIA GUNN.
- HI.
- LET'S TALK
ABOUT THE SNATCH GAME.
THIS IS SEASON 6.
YOU DON'T PICK A CELEBRITY
WITH NOT A BIG PERSONALITY.
IT WAS FLAT.
- WHEN I SPOKE WITH YOU
IN THE WORKROOM,
YOU WERE GONNA DO SELENA.
WHY'D YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND?
- BECAUSE SHE IS NOT
A COMEDY CHARACTER.
- BUT THAT JUST DAWNED ON YOU
IN THE WORKROOM?
LISTEN, A LOT COULD BE FORGIVEN
IF YOU WERE FUNNY,
BUT YOU WERE NOT FUNNY.
NEXT UP, LAGANJA ESTRANJA.
- HI, MAMA RU.
- RACHEL ZOE.
YOU WERE PLAYING, LIKE,
THE CHICKEN LADY
FROM "KIDS IN THE HALL."
THERE WAS A LOT
OF THIS KIND OF--
- I AGREE.
- IT DIDN'T WORK.
- RACHEL ZOE IS KNOWN
FOR SO MANY CATCHPHRASES
THAT I MIGHT WRITE
A CHEAT SHEET.
- I DID.
- YOU DID?
- I DEFINITELY GOT
IN MY HEAD IN THIS ONE.
I SAW MY SISTERS
REALLY SUCCEEDING.
INSTEAD OF PUSHING
MORE FORWARD, I SUNK BACK.
- YOU'RE TALENTED,
SO IT HURTS TO SEE IT.
- IT HURTS ME, TOO.
- UP NEXT, BIANCA DEL RIO.
LOVE THAT DRESS.
- YOU CAN BORROW IT.
- [LAUGHS]
- I HAVE BEEN WAITING
FOR A QUEEN TO DO JUDGE JUDY.
IT WAS BRILLIANT.
- WELL IT DOES HELP THAT
I'M A JUDGMENTAL BITCH, TOO.
[LAUGHTER]
THAT DOES KIND OF HELP.
- YOU WERE ABLE TO INTERACT
WITH THE OTHER QUEENS.
IT WAS FABULOUS.
- NEXT UP, ADORE DELANO.
- THERE IS NOTHING RUPAUL
ABOUT THAT WIG,
NOR THE LOOK, QUITE HONESTLY.
- I WAS DOING ADORE
INSPIRED BY RUPAUL.
- YEAH, YOU WERE DOING ADORE.
AND I THINK THIS LENGTH IS GOING
TO BE A RUNNING THEME FOR YOU.
BUT I CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH
FOR CINCHING YOUR WAIST.
IT CHANGES YOUR BODY COMPLETELY.
YOU NEED TO START DOING THIS
ALL THE TIME.
- I CAN FEEL MY HEART
IN MY THROAT,
AND IT TASTES AMAZING!
[LAUGHTER]
- YOUR ANNA NICOLE SMITH,
GUESS AD, '94 REALNESS
WAS PERFORMANCE ART.
- UP NEXT, DELA.
- I LOVE THIS YELLOW LOOK.
IT'S REALLY WELL-DONE.
- I DON'T EVEN WATCH
"DOWNTON ABBEY,"
AND I WAS DYING
OVER MAGGIE SMITH.
- YEAH, LIKE, WHEN YOU SAID,
"WE ORIGINATED THE LANGUAGE,"
THAT WAS, LIKE,
ONE OF THE FUNNIEST THINGS
I HEARD ALL DAY YESTERDAY,
AND I THINK I SAID IT
ABOUT 6 TIMES AFTER I LEFT.
- LAST BUT NOT LEAST, MILK.
- HELLO, HELLO, HELLO.
- [LAUGHS]
- PART OF ME, MILK,
IS EXTREMELY OFFENDED
THAT YOU WOULD COME OUT
ON THE RUNWAY IN PANTS.
PART OF ME THINKS IT'S GENIUS
BECAUSE IT IS RUPAUL.
- WELL, THAT'S SORT OF
WHAT I LOVE--
I LOVE GOING FOR THE UNEXPECTED.
- BUT THIS
DOESN'T SHOCK ME, REALLY.
WHAT WOULD SHOCK ME
IS IF YOU HAD COME OUT HERE
AND DONE SOMETHING
SO AMAZINGLY GLAM,
BECAUSE WE REALLY HAVEN'T
SEEN YOU LIKE THAT.
- I COULD GO MORE GLAM,
BUT IT WOULDN'T BE
STAYING TRUE TO MY AESTHETIC.
- BUT I WOULD LOVE
TO SEE YOU AS GLAMAZON.
- HONESTLY, SOMETIMES,
I DO FEEL THAT,
IF I WERE TO PUT ON
A BEAUTIFUL DRESS
LIKE THESE GIRLS
AND BEAUTIFUL HAIR LIKE THEM,
I WOULD STAND OUT
FOR THE WRONG REASONS,
AND PEOPLE WOULD
JUST LAUGH OF ME,
AND I WOULDN'T BE ABLE
TO LAUGH AT MYSELF.
- BUT IT'S HARD TO FALL
IN LOVE WITH SOMEONE
WHO DOESN'T SHOW
THAT VULNERABILITY
THAT YOU'RE AFRAID OF.
LADIES, THANK YOU.
WHILE YOU UNWIND
IN THE UNTUCKED LOUNGE,
THE JUDGES AND I
WILL DELIBERATE.
ALL RIGHT, JUST BETWEEN US
RUPAUL IMPERSONATORS,
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
IT'S THE TIGHTEST SNATCH GAME
IN HISTORY.
- I AGREE, AND I SHOULD KNOW
ABOUT TIGHT SNATCH GAMES.
- I DON'T THINK SO, MICHELLE.
[LAUGHTER]
- LET'S START
WITH BIANCA DEL RIO.
- HER JUDGE JUDY,
IT WAS WELL-RESEARCHED,
SHE STAYED IN CHARACTER.
IT WAS A PERFECT CHOICE
FOR HER.
- BUT I DIDN'T THINK
THAT SHE WAS
THE BEST RU LOOK.
YOU DIDN'T LOOK AT IT
AND GO "OH, MY GOD,
THAT JUST REMINDS ME
SO MUCH OF RUPAUL."
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S MOVE ON TO
LAGANJA ESTRANJA.
- WHAT SHE WAS GIVING
IS YOUR THIN BOD, YOU KNOW,
INTERGALACTIC LOOK.
YEAH, IT WASN'T ALL GOLD,
IT WAS PURPLE AND BLACK,
BUT I DIDN'T MIND HER LOOK,
TONIGHT, ON THE RUNWAY.
- FOR ME, HER RACHEL ZOE
WAS MORE WILLIAM SHATNER
THAN RACHEL ZOE.
- OOH, THAT'S HOT.
- RIGHT?
- I REALLY THINK THE NERVES
GOT THE BEST OF HER.
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S MOVE ON DOWN
TO ADORE DELANO.
THAT ANNA NICOLE SMITH--
I WAS HYPNOTIZED.
I KNEW ANNA NICOLE SMITH,
AND SHE WAS REALLY
CHANNELING HER.
- BUT WHEN SHE CAME OUT,
SUPPOSEDLY BEING YOU,
I THOUGHT SHE WAS
KIND OF STILL DOING
A LITTLE BIT OF
ANNA NICOLE, LIKE--
- [LAUGHS]
- I THINK SHE REALLY
HAS BEEN ACTING
LIKE ANNA NICOLE HER WHOLE LIFE,
AND THEN I DIDN'T THINK
THE IMPRESSION WAS AS AMAZING
AS I THOUGHT IT WAS
THE OTHER DAY.
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S MOVE ON
TO BENDELACREME.
- I THINK SHE WAS SUPERIOR
IN THE LOOK OF RU,
AND ALSO IN THE CHARACTER
OF MAGGIE SMITH.
- I WOULD AGREE.
HER COMEBACKS WERE SO FUNNY.
- BUT THE CON FOR ME WAS,
IT WAS ANOTHER OLD LADY.
- AH, THAT'S RIGHT,
THAT'S HER FORTE.
- NOT THAT IT WASN'T BRILLIANT,
BUT I FELT WE SAW IT ALREADY.
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S MOVE ON DOWN
TO GIA GUNN.
- YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT
A HALLOWEEN COSTUME IN A BAG--
THAT WIG, AND THE
WONKY EYE WITH THE EYELASH.
- CRACK HO.
[LAUGHTER]
- AND COULDN'T HAVE PICKED
A WORSE CHARACTER
TO DO ON SNATCH GAME.
- YOU COULD DO KIM KARDASHIAN.
- IF YOU PLAYED IT UP.
- IF YOU PLAYED IT UP.
- I CONCUR.
WHERE WERE THE BOOBIES,
WHERE WAS THE ASS?
SHE COULD HAVE STARTED
EVERY LETTER WITH A "K."
- THAT'S A BRILLIANT IDEA,
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN FUNNY.
- SHE JUST DIDN'T
REALLY GO FOR IT.
- ALL RIGHT.
NEXT UP, MILK!
- WELL, I COULD SEE THE WHEELS
TURNING EVERY MOMENT
OF THE JULIA CHILD.
- I THINK SHE MADE A REALLY
POOR CHOICE BEING BOY RU,
BECAUSE WE'RE HERE TO SEE
ALL DIFFERENT SIDES OF A QUEEN.
- BUT I SEE THIS CONFLICT
IN MILK
BETWEEN WANTING TO STAY TRUE
TO THIS GENDER-BENDING,
WHICH I RESPECT,
BUT I FEEL LIKE EVERY TIME
I'VE HEARD A DRAG QUEEN
ON THIS SHOW SAY,
"I NEED TO STAY TRUE
TO MY DRAG,"
THEY GO HOME
VERY SHORTLY THEREAFTER.
[LAUGHTER]
- SILENCE.
I'VE MADE MY DECISION.
BRING BACK MY GIRLS.
- [LAUGHS]
- [LAUGHS]
- WELCOME BACK, LADIES.
I'VE MADE SOME DECISIONS.
- TONIGHT,
IT'S THE PRIME
OF MISS BENDELACREME.
CONDRAGULATIONS, YOU ARE
THE WINNER OF THIS CHALLENGE.
- THANK YOU SO, SO MUCH.
- YOU'VE WON TWO COUTURE OUTFITS
FROM SYREN LATEX,
A LEADER IN LATEX FASHION.
- I'M THE FIRST ONE
TO WIN TWO CHALLENGES,
AND THIS IS THE CHALLENGE
THAT I WAS MOST TERRIFIED ABOUT,
AND I WON IT!
- BIANCA DEL RIO, YOU'RE SAFE.
ADORE, YOU'RE SAFE.
MILK,
YOUR JULIA CHILD IMPERSONATION
WAS HALF-BAKED.
GIA GUNN, AS KIM KARDASHIAN,
YOU FELL FLAT ON YOUR ASS.
LAGANJA ESTRANJA,
YOUR RACHEL ZOE
WAS SO FASHION WEAK,
LITERALLY.
MILK, YOU ARE SAFE.
- THIS IS SOME BULLSHIT.
MILK BELONGS IN THE BOTTOM.
- BUT JUST BY THE SEAT
OF MY PANTS.
GIA AND LAGANJA,
I'M SORRY, MY DEARS,
BUT YOU ARE UP FOR ELIMINATION.
TWO QUEENS STAND BEFORE ME.
LADIES, THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE
TO IMPRESS ME,
AND SAVE YOURSELF
FROM ELIMINATION.
THE TIME HAS COME
FOR YOU TO LIP-SYNC
FOR YOUR LIFE.
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M IN THE BOTTOM TWO,
AND I'M UP AGAINST
ONE OF MY BEST FRIENDS
IN THIS COMPETITION,
AND THAT REALLY SUCKS.
- GOOD LUCK,
AND DON'T FUCK IT UP.
- GIRL, I'M GIVING IT
EVERYTHING I'VE GOT.
TOE-TOUCHING, THE SPLITS,
DEATH DROPS RIGHT OFF THE BAT--
I DON'T WANT TO GO HOME.
- I'M SHOWING THE JUDGES
THAT I LOVE TO PERFORM,
THAT I LOVE TO VOGUE,
AND I'M GIVING FACE,
AND THAT'S USUALLY WHAT COUNTS.
- RULE NUMBER ONE--
YOU'RE GOING TO DO
A REVEAL,
GET OUT OF THE DRESS.
WE ALL KNOW "REVEAL"
IN FRENCH
MEANS TAKE THE SHIT OFF.
- THE JUMP SPLIT
IS PRETTY IMPRESSIVE.
I CAN SEE THE DIFFERENCE
IN THEIR STYLES.
GIA IS A LOT MORE CONTROLLED.
LAGANJA IS GIVING EVERYTHING.
[APPLAUSE]
- LADIES,
I'VE MADE MY DECISION.
LAGANJA ESTRANJA,
SHANTE, YOU STAY.
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.
- YOU MAY JOIN THE OTHER GIRLS.
- G-G-G-GIA,
MY PET, MAKE NO MISTAKE,
I LOVE YOU FROM HEAD TO TOE.
NOW, SASHAY AWAY.
[APPLAUSE]
- YOU GUYS ARE ALL STILL DUDES.
I'M UPSET THAT THERE'S OTHER
CROSSDRESSERS STILL IN THERE
THAT FUCKING CAME TO A DRAG SHOW
DRESSED AS BOYS.
I MEAN, IF YOU LOOK UP "DRAG,"
DRAG MEANS DRESSING UP AS GIRLS,
NOT RE-ENHANCING
WHAT YOU ALREADY ARE,
WHICH IS A FUCKING BIG MAN.
- MY 9 LADIES PRANCING.
REMEMBER,
IF YOU CAN'T LOVE YOURSELF,
HOW THE HELL
YOU GONNA LOVE SOMEBODY ELSE?
CAN I GET A "AMEN" IN HERE?
- AMEN.
- NOW, LET THE MUSIC PLAY.


- PREVIOUSLY ON
"RUPAUL'S DRAG RACE"...
YOU'LL TRANSFORM
THESE GALLANT GROOMS
INTO BLUSHING BRIDES.
- I'M NOT A SEAMSTRESS.
I'M NOT CINDERELLA.
I DON'T HAVE MICE TO COME
HELP ME MAKE THIS DAMN GARMENT.
- I NOW PRONOUNCE YOU MARRIED.
- [CHEERING]
- I DIDN'T GET THE GOTH THING.
YOUR OUTFIT SEEMED
A LITTLE COCKTAIL PARTY.
- THE FACE LOOKS METALLIC.
- BIANCA DEL RIO,
YOU ARE THE WINNER
OF THIS WEEK'S MAIN CHALLENGE.
ADORE DELANO,
SHANTE, YOU STAY.
JOSLYN FOX, SASHAY AWAY.
- SURPRISE!
- THE FABULOUS 5.
- LET'S SEE WHAT JOSY SAYS.
- CAN WE ALL JUST
DO A FOXY SIGNOFF?
- KEEP IT FOXY.
BOOP BOOP!
- MEW MEW.
- KEEP IT FOXY.
- CONGRATULATIONS
TO YOU, YOUNG LADY.
- I'M THE NEW TRINITY.
- YOU TURNED OUT
THAT LIP SYNC,
EVEN THOUGH WHEN YOU
TOOK OFF YOUR SHOES,
YOU LOOKED A LITTLE LIKE
THE GIRL FROM "THE GRUDGE."
- YEAH, I DID.
I KIND OF HIT A SLUMP.
I'VE BEEN IN
THE BOTTOM TWO TWICE,
BUT I KNOW THAT I'M NOT GONNA BE
IN THE BOTTOM TWO AGAIN,
BECAUSE THAT FEELING
SUCKS DONKEY DICK.
- CONGRATULATIONS, BIANCA.
- THANK YOU, MY LOVE.
I WILL SEND ALL OF YOU
A POSTCARD FROM HAWAII,
BECAUSE REMEMBER,
YOU'RE MY SISTERS.
- BIANCA IS SO
COMFORTABLE RIGHT NOW,
SHE'S PRACTICALLY JUST, LIKE,
TAKING A NAP ON THE COUCH.
THE LAST TIME I GOT COCKY
ABOUT MY POSITION,
I WOUND UP IN THE BOTTOM TWO.
- I NOTICED A LITTLE
DARIENNE LAKE
WITH THE POTTY MOUTH
WHEN SHE WALKED BACK
FROM BEING SAFE.
- I'M MAD AS HELL THAT
I'M IN THE BOTTOM 3.
DID I THINK I OUTPERFORMED
COURTNEY IN THAT CHALLENGE?
YES.
I BLAME IT ON THAT GODDAMN
DOOGIE HOWSER
AND HIS LITTLE, YOU KNOW,
VAL KILMER KNOCKOFF BOYFRIEND.
- HE'S A DOCTOR.
YOUR DAUGHTER
SHOULD BE SO LUCKY.
- DARIENNE'S NOT QUITE
LISTENING TO THE JUDGES
OR RU OR ANYONE
FOR THAT MATTER.
SHE ALWAYS THINKS SHE DOES
BETTER THAN SHE DOES.
SHE'S LIKE THOSE FRIENDS
THAT GO OUT WITH YOU
AND THEY'RE LIKE,
"OH, THAT MAN'S LOOKING AT ME."
I'M LIKE, "NO,
HE'S JUST LOOKING AT
YOU HAVE A FUCKING BOOGER
ON YOUR NOSE, BITCH."
THAT'S CALLED DELUSION,
AND THAT IS GONNA HURT HER.
[ENGINE STARTS, THEN REVS]
- THE WINNER OF
"RUPAUL'S DRAG RACE"
RECEIVES A SICKENING SUPPLY
OF COLOREVOLUTION COSMETICS
AND A CASH PRIZE
OF $100,000.
WITH EXTRA-SPECIAL GUEST JUDGES
KHLOE KARDASHIAN
AND BOB MACKIE!
[TIRES SCREECH]
- [LAUGHTER]
- TOP 5.
- WE ARE SO CLOSE TO THE TOP 3,
AND IT'S KIND OF HARD TO
KNOW WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN
BECAUSE IT FEELS LIKE
THERE MIGHT BE TWO PEOPLE
ELIMINATED NEXT,
OR MAYBE THEY'RE JUST GONNA
BRING IN ANOTHER 14 GIRLS
AND START OVER AGAIN.
- AFTER, LIKE, THE FIRST
DAY OF MEETING EVERYBODY,
I WROTE DOWN IN A BOOK--
I HAVE PROOF THAT
I PICKED US AS THE TOP 5.
- YOU ARE SUCH A LIAR.
- I SWEAR TO GOD.
- YOU ARE SO FULL OF SHIT.
- WELL, IT WAS THE BEST OF
A BAD BUNCH, REALLY, WASN'T IT?
- OH, YOU ARE
STARTING SOME SHIT.
[ALARM BLARING]
- SAVED BY THE BELL.
- OOH, GIRL!
MY PRECIOUS GEMS,
TO EXPERIENCE THE SWEET
SMELL OF SUCCESS,
YOU NEED TO BE
THE JEWEL IN MY CROWN.
SHINE BRIGHT LIKE A DIAMOND,
OR YOU CAN JUST PULL
MY RING FINGER.
HELLO, HELLO, HELLO.
- HI.
- NOW, IN THE HEAT
OF COMPETITION,
A LOT OF UNEXPRESSED FEELINGS
CAN GET BOTTLED UP,
SO FOR TODAY'S MINI-CHALLENGE,
I WANT TO DO SOME
THERAPEUTIC ROLE PLAYING,
AND WE'RE GONNA DO IT...
WITH PUPPETS,
BECAUSE EVERYBODY
LOVES PUPPETS!
- AH!
- NOW, I WONDER
WHO'S BEHIND THAT WALL.
WELL, GLORY HOLE-ELUJAH.
IT'S THE SCRUFF PIT CREW.
- [WOOFING]
- FIRST UP, ADORE.
WHO'D YOU GET?
- DELA.
- YAY!
- YAY!
- MY EYEBROWS HAVE
NEVER LOOKED LIKE THAT.
- NEXT UP, BIANCA.
- I HAVE ADORE.
- ADORE.
- OH, SHIT.
- NEXT UP, DARIENNE LAKE.
- [GIGGLING]
OOH!
[GASPS]
I GOT COURTNEY ACT.
- NEXT UP, DELA.
WHO'D YOU PICK?
- IT'S BIANCA DEL RIO.
- ALL RIGHT, COURTNEY,
GO ON OVER.
- I HOPE THE HOLE'S
BIG ENOUGH.
IT'S DARIENNE LAKE.
- ALL RIGHT, GIRLS,
ON YOUR MARK, GET SET,
DRAG IT UP!
- BIANCA, YOU GIVING IT
A NICE HOG BODY?
- OH, YOU THINK?
- YOU ARE SO EVIL.
- DO YOU HAVE COURTNEY'S
COSTUME TOGETHER?
- I WAS HOPING THAT I COULD GET
SOMEBODY ELSE TO MAKE IT FOR ME.
- [GASP]
OOH!
- IT'S INTERESTING
THAT BIANCA,
WHO COULD HAVE TAKEN
ANY OF US DOWN,
GOT THE ABSOLUTELY
EASIEST TO PUPPET.
- I DID GET THE EASY ONE.
- OH, SHUT UP. WHAT IS
THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?
- IT'S NOTHING BAD.
YOU'RE JUST BASICALLY
ALREADY A PUPPET.
- OH, THAT IS SO RUDE.
- NO. BUT YOU'RE REALLY
EASY TO IMITATE,
WHEREAS BIANCA'S HARD TO IMITATE
BECAUSE I DON'T LISTEN TO HER.
- OH HO HO!
OH, MY GOD.
- ALL RIGHT,
LET THE BITCHFEST BEGIN.
- HI, BENDELACREME.
HOW ARE YOU?
- HONESTLY, LIKE,
I'M REALLY GOOD.
IT'S JUST
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY THE JUDGES SAY THAT
MY OUTFITS LOOK COSTUMEY.
- SO WHAT DO YOU USE
TO COVER YOUR EYEBROWS?
- OATMEAL.
- OH, FUNNY.
- I, UM...
I DON'T KNOW IF MY EYEBROWS
ARE REALLY THAT OATMEALY.
- I'LL TEACH YOU HOW TO
COVER UP YOUR HOG BODY
IF YOU HELP ME BLEND.
- OK. I SWEAR, YOU'RE
AMAZING AND PERFECT.
- THANK YOU.
- [LAUGHTER]
- ADORE, I'M REALLY NERVOUS
BECAUSE I'D THINK YOU CAN SEE
YOUR DIRTY PANTYHOSE.
- PARTY, FUCK!
I DO HAVE REALLY DIRTY TIGHTS.
THEY SMELL LIKE FEET.
I'M TOO PUNK TO WASH MY TIGHTS.
I FEEL SO COOL, COOL, COOL.
I'M A LIBRA.
COOL. FUCK. PARTY!
- WELL, COURTNEY,
I LOVE YOUR DRESS.
- THANK YOU, DAZZLE.
I'D LOVE TO COMPLIMENT YOU
ON SOMETHING,
BUT EVERYTHING YOU WEAR
IS SO DAMN HIDEOUS.
IT'S NOT THAT
YOUR CLOTHES ARE UGLY.
IT'S JUST...
YOU'RE MISSHAPEN.
- OK.
WOW, COURTNEY.
YOU COULD PROBABLY GLUE DOWN
THAT LACE FRONT THERE.
OH! NO, THAT'S JUST
YOUR SKIN THAT'S WRINKLED.
- WELL, I'M THE OLDEST
LIVING TWINK IN HISTORY.
- WELL, YOU GOT
THAT TWINK BODY.
YOU COULD PROBABLY DO
A COUPLE OF SQUATS
TO TIGHTEN UP THAT ASS.
- YOU LOOK LIKE A WALLABY.
- HI, DARIENNE. HOW ARE YOU?
- HI. I'M DARIENNE LAKE!
- SO, DARIENNE, TELL ME,
HAVE YOU HAD A FUN TIME
ON "RUPAUL'S DRAG RACE?"
- I'VE HAD
A GREAT TIME, COURTNEY!
- WHAT'S BEEN YOUR
LEAST FAVORITE PART?
- HMM. PROBABLY
THE GUEST JUDGES.
- OH.
- NEIL PATRICK HARRIS HATES ME.
- OH. AND WHAT ABOUT
HIS BOYFRIEND?
- I TOLD HIM HE COULD USE $1.50
TO GO RIDE THE BUS.
- I'M FINDING IT REALLY HARD
TO MAKE YOU FUNNY, DARIENNE.
IT'S JUST LIKE REAL LIFE.
- I'M GONNA GO CHECK
THE INTERNET FOR SOME JOKES.
I DON'T HAVE ANY WI-FI HERE,
SO I'M FINDING IT VERY
DIFFICULT TO BE FUNNY.
- HI THERE, BIANCA.
HOW ARE YOU DOING TODAY?
- TERRIBLE. THESE PEOPLE
ARE A BUNCH OF ASSHOLES!
- OH. WELL, BIANCA,
WHAT A THING TO SAY!
- BALONEY!
- NOW, BIANCA, YOUR DRESS
LOOKS GORGEOUS TODAY.
- WELL, THANK GOODNESS,
BECAUSE I HAVE 50 OF THE SAME
DRESS IN DIFFERENT FABRICS.
- BIANCA, TELL ME A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT HOW YOU'RE FEELING
IN THIS COMPETITION.
- ALL THESE PEOPLE ARE
IDIOTS AND ASSHOLES.
ADORE'S AN IDIOT.
DELA'S GOT A STUPID VOICE.
SANTINO'S ASSHOLE IS LOOSE.
- OH, BIANCA, PET.
LOOKS LIKE YOUR LACE FRONT
IS COMING OFF.
- BALONEY.
I HAVE NO PROBLEMS.
I LIVE IN NEW YORK.
I WORK ALL THE TIME.
BALONEY. AAH!
ASSHOLES! AAH!
- NICE WORK,
MY LITTLE LAMB CHOPS.
THE WINNER OF TODAY'S
MINI-CHALLENGE IS...
BENDELACREME!
- YEAH!
I KNEW IF I HITCHED
MYSELF TO THIS WAGON,
IT WOULD PULL ME SOMEWHERE.
- BALONEY!
FOR THIS WEEK'S MAIN CHALLENGE,
THE HOUSE OF RUPAUL IS THROWING
THE FIRST EVER...
GLITTER BALL!
YOU NEED TO SERVE
3 DISTINCT LOOKS.
FIRST CATEGORY IS...
BANJEE GIRL BLING.
SECOND CATEGORY IS...
PLATINUM CARD
EXECUTIVE REALNESS.
AND THE LAST
AND SHINIEST OF ALL
CATEGORY IS...
DRIPPING IN JEWELS ELEGANZA.
- SO THAT MEANS THAT IT'S
ANOTHER COSTUME CHALLENGE.
HOLY SHIT.
- NOW, USING ALL THESE
SICKENING STONES
PROVIDED BY FIERCE!
DRAG JEWELS
AND MATERIALS FROM
THE FABRIC PLANET WALL,
I EXPECT YOU TO SPARKLE,
NEELY, SPARKLE.
BENDELACREME, YOU WON
THE MINI-CHALLENGE,
SO YOU GET TO ASSIGN
THE JEWEL TONES.
THERE'S DIAMOND,
RUBY, TOPAZ,
SAPPHIRE,
AND ROSE QUARTZ.
ROSE QUARTZ?
I THINK I WENT TO
HEBREW SCHOOL WITH HER.
GENTLEMEN,
START YOUR ENGINES,
AND MAY THE BEST WOMAN WIN.
- WE HAVE TO
COME UP WITH 3 LOOKS.
ONE OF THEM HAS TO BE
FROM SCRATCH,
AND WE'VE GOT LIKE
A DAY TO DO IT.
- COMING UP...
- THE HEAT IS ON.
[GROANS]
- I JUST GET REALLY, LIKE,
DISCOURAGED AND,
LIKE, FRUSTRATED.
[ENGINE REVS]
- [RUPAUL LAUGHING]
- COME ON, DIAMOND.
OH!
- FOR TODAY'S MAIN CHALLENGE,
WE'RE GETTING READY FOR
THE "ALL THAT GLITTERS" BALL.
WE NEED TO CREATE
3 DISTINCT LOOKS:
BANJEE GIRL BLING,
PLATINUM CARD
EXECUTIVE REALNESS,
AND DRIPPING IN JEWELS ELEGANZA
IN OUR DESIGNATED JEWEL TONE.
- [GROANS]
- YOU ALL RIGHT?
- I'M JUST HAVING SOME PROBLEMS.
IN THE PAST, WE'VE HAD TO CREATE
ONE LOOK FOR THE RUNWAY,
BUT THIS IS 3 SEPARATE LOOKS.
EVERYBODY IS PRETTY WORRIED
ABOUT THIS CHALLENGE
EXCEPT, OF COURSE,
BIANCA DEL RIO.
- I LIKE THIS TO START WITH.
- SHE'S KIND OF THE MARKER
YOU HAVE TO BE LOOKING AT.
BECAUSE SHE HAS
THE SEWING SKILLS,
SHE CAN JUST BANG
THINGS OUT A LOT FASTER
THAN THE REST OF US CAN.
- THAT'S PRETTY.
- YEAH.
- FUCK OFF.
- SO WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT MADE YOU PICK ME
AS SAPPHIRE?
- I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE
ANY OF THE COLORS
WERE POSITIVES OR NEGATIVES.
I THOUGHT THE ONLY ONE
THAT WAS, LIKE,
SORT OF ESPECIALLY EASY
WAS DIAMONDS,
WHICH IS WHY
I THREW IT TO ADORE.
- REALLY?
WHY NOT JUST GIVE HER
CEMENT SHOES
AND THROW HER IN THE WATER
AND GIVE HER SOMETHING
REALLY ROUGH?
- BECAUSE SHE'S
NOT A EVIL CUNT.
- I MEAN, THIS IS A COMPETITION.
- SO, BITCH?
I WOULDN'T THROW YOU
UNDER THE DAMN OCEAN.
ONLY AN INSECURE BITCH
WOULD SAY SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
IT IS A COMPETITION,
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO SABOTAGE
ANYBODY ON THE WAY THERE.
- AM I BEING HATEFUL
BY SAYING THAT?
- NO, YOU'RE BEING REAL.
- AND THAT'S WHAT
I AM, A-REAL.
- AND YOUR REAL SELF
IS HATEFUL.
- ROWR.
- PEOPLE SAY THAT
I'M BEING MEAN,
BUT I'M IN THIS FOR
A CROWN AND $100,000.
YOU HELP YOURSELF
BEFORE YOU HELP OTHERS.
- HELLO, HELLO, HELLO.
- HELLO.
- HOW ARE THINGS
IN THE JEWELRIES DISTRICT?
- STONED.
- [LAUGHTER]
- ADORE DELANO.
- HI, RU.
- ALL RIGHT, SO WHAT
ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT
FOR YOUR DRIPPING
IN JEWELS ELEGANZA?
- I WAS THINKING OF JUST, LIKE,
BEJEWELING THE HELL OUT OF THIS,
BUT I WANT--I DON'T KNOW.
I HAVE, LIKE, SO MANY IDEAS,
AND THAT'S THE THING.
LIKE, I THINK, LIKE,
OF SO MANY THINGS,
AND I JUST REALLY WANT
TO GET IT, LIKE, DONE.
- WHAT CAN YOU SHOW THE JUDGES
TO LET THEM KNOW THAT
YOU ARE TOP-3 MATERIAL?
- I JUST THINK, LIKE,
WHAT I HAD IN THE
BEGINNING OR WHATEVER,
LIKE, IT KIND OF GOT LOST.
I JUST GET REALLY,
LIKE, DISCOURAGED
AND, LIKE, FRUSTRATED.
I DON'T WANT TO BE, LIKE,
THE CHIONA, LIKE,
THAT CRIES ALL THE TIME,
BUT IT JUST PISSES ME OFF
BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE I'M SO
TALENTED, LIKE, IN OTHER THINGS,
SO I'M JUST, "WHY CAN'T,
LIKE, MY BRAIN, LIKE,
ALLOW ME TO MAKE
A FUCKING DRESS?"
- RIGHT, RIGHT.
- IT'S LIKE, I DON'T
WANT TO LIP-SYNC AGAIN.
I CAME HERE TO BE, LIKE, TOP 3
AND TO FUCKING WIN IT.
- RIGHT, RIGHT.
YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE NOTES
THAT I'VE GIVEN YOU A LOT
IS THAT YOU HAVE TO LEARN TO
APPLY YOUR GREAT THINGS,
LIKE IN THE RAPPING
OR THE SINGING.
YOU HAVE TO APPLY WHAT YOU HAVE
THERE INTO THE OTHER CHALLENGES.
PUT IT IN THIS FUCKING DRESS.
YOU HEAR WHAT I'M SAYING?
- YEAH, I DO.
- ALL RIGHT, ADORE.
YOU GET BACK TO WORK.
- THANKS. SORRY FOR
CRYING ALL THE TIME.
- EMOTIONS DON'T SCARE ME.
- THANK YOU, RU.
- ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT, Y'ALL.
- HI.
- I'M ON THE DL.
- MM. YO, YO.
- NOW, YOU KNOW, IN THE PAST,
THE JUDGES HAVE COME AFTER YOU
FOR THIS OR THAT.
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT
THE JUDGES' CRITIQUES?
- YOU KNOW, I FEEL
I'M LISTENING,
AND I'M KIND OF
GETTING IT AND, LIKE,
TRYING TO REALLY
GROW FROM IT.
YOU KNOW, I MEAN,
AS LARGE AS I AM,
I STILL HAVE
ROOM TO GROW.
- DON'T WE ALL?
- MM-HMM.
- SO WHY IS IT,
DO YOU THINK,
YOU HAVEN'T WON
MORE CHALLENGES?
- I THINK IT'S
BECAUSE IT'S LIKE...
PARTIALLY, I THINK--
- WHY HAVEN'T YOU
WON MORE CHALLENGES?
- I KNOW. BECAUSE THERE'S ALWAYS
A LITTLE SOMETHING OFF WITH ME.
- YOU GOT TO WIN SOME
CHALLENGES, YOU KNOW.
LOOK AT THOSE
FINE-TUNE THINGS
THAT YOU THINK THE JUDGES
MIGHT COME AFTER YOU FOR.
- YES.
- ALL RIGHT,
YOU GET BACK TO WORK.
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.
- DELA.
- HI, RU.
- NOW, YOU HAVEN'T WON
A CHALLENGE SINCE SNATCH GAME.
- YEAH.
- WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
TO GET TO THE TOP OF
THE HEAP THIS TIME?
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING
FOR YOUR ELEGANZA?
- I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT
THE FILM "WHAT A WAY TO GO!"
- OH, "WHAT A WAY
TO GO!" YES. UH-HUH.
- YEAH, AND THERE'S
ALL THOSE JUST, LIKE,
INSANE COCKTAIL-PARTY DRESSES.
I'M TRYING TO CHANNEL
THAT KIND OF FEEL.
- OH, I LOVE THAT.
THAT SOUNDS GREAT.
- THE LAST TWO CHALLENGES,
I WAS, LIKE,
THIS CLOSE TO WINNING,
BUT I'M NOT GONNA BE SECOND
THIS TIME AROUND.
BIANCA CAN MAKE THE MOST
BROADWAY-RIFIC COSTUME.
I AM GOING TO FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO MAKE SOMETHING
THAT THE JUDGES ARE
GOING TO BE WOWED BY.
- ALL RIGHT,
MY RHINESTONE COWGIRLS,
GATHER ROUND.
NOW, TOMORROW,
TWO OF MY EXTRA-FAVORITE
GUEST JUDGES WILL BE RETURNING.
THE SHINING STAR OF
TV's ROYAL FAMILY,
KHLOE KARDASHIAN,
WILL BE RETURNING...
AND FASHION'S MOST DAZZLING
DESIGNER EVER--
THE ONE AND ONLY BOB MACKIE.
- I ADORE BOB MACKIE.
HE'S DESIGNED FOR EVERYONE:
CHER, DIAHANN CARROLL,
DIANA ROSS, LIZA MINNELLI,
BARBRA STREISAND
IN "FUNNY LADY."
HE'S DONE EVERYTHING.
- OH, AND, UM,
JUST ONE MORE THING.
- OH, HERE WE GO.
- IN ADDITION TO CREATING
3 BALL LOOKS,
YOU'LL BE PUTTING ON
THE GLITZ
IN A FLAWLESS
OPENING NUMBER.
NOW, DELA, YOU WON
THE MINI-CHALLENGE,
SO YOU'RE IN CHARGE
OF CHOREOGRAPHY.
- OH.
- THE ONLY TIME
I'VE SEEN DELA DANCE
IS DURING HER LIP-SYNC,
AND IF I RECALL,
SHE DID BEAR SIMILARITIES
TO A RUBBER CHICKEN.
- GOOD LUCK, MY PRECIOUS GEMS,
AND DON'T FUCK IT UP.
COMING UP...
- I HATE THAT.
- WHAT IF WE DID THIS?
THEN WE'RE ALL IN A ROW.
- WHY DON'T WE JUST DO
OUR OWN THING?
- UM, IT'D BE GOOD TO
JUST HAVE ONE BOSS, NOT 5.
[ENGINE REVS]
- [RUPAUL LAUGHING]
[MUSIC PLAYING]
- LET'S GET THIS SHIT
OVER WITH.
- SO IN ADDITION TO
CREATING 3 LOOKS
FOR THE "ALL THAT
GLITTERS" BALL,
WE ALSO HAVE TO CREATE AND
CHOREOGRAPH AN OPENING NUMBER.
- UM, ALL RIGHT.
IS ANYBODY SPECIFICALLY, LIKE,
CHOREOGRAPHY-INCLINED?
- I CAN DO IT
AND DO IT EASILY.
- OK, IT'S DEFINITELY
A LOT OF PRESSURE
TO BE IN CHARGE OF
THIS CHOREOGRAPHY.
I'M DEFINITELY GOING TO GET
ALL THE HELP I CAN GET
FROM COURTNEY,
BECAUSE COURTNEY HAS DONE
MORE CHOREOGRAPHY THAN I HAVE.
- DARIENNE, DO YOU
WANT TO STAND HERE?
ADORE, DO YOU WANT
TO STAND HERE?
AND I THINK
IF WE'RE ALL ON PROFILE
LOOKING OUT WITH, LIKE,
OUR STOLES AROUND OUR NECKS,
AND THEN THAT'S
WHEN DELA WILL COME
SORT OF BURSTING-THROUGH-
THE-MIDDLE SORT OF THING.
- OK.
- WHAT IF WE DID THIS?
WHAT IF WE'RE ALL HERE,
AND THEN ON OUR LINES...
THEN WE'RE ALL IN A ROW.
- OR WE COULD EVEN DO,
LIKE, YOU KNOW,
THE HOUSE DOWN
AND JUST, YOU KNOW,
GET RID OF OUR THINGS SO WE
DON'T HAVE TO HOLD ON TO THESE.
- YEAH. COULD WE
JUST THROW THEM?
- UM, IT'S CHALLENGING
WHEN THERE'S 5 PEOPLE
TRYING TO CHOREOGRAPH A NUMBER.
LIKE, EVERYBODY'S THROWING
THEIR FEW CENTS IN.
IT'D BE GOOD TO JUST
HAVE ONE BOSS, NOT 5.
- OH.
- I HATE THAT.
- IT'S TOO FAST.
- THE ENDING SEEMS LIKE
WE DRANK CAFFEINE
AND WENT TO A ZUMBA CLASS.
- VERY THAT.
WHY DON'T WE JUST
DO OUR OWN THING?
- BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE TRYING
TO LOOK POLISHED AND...
- WE'VE ONLY GOT, LIKE--
WE'VE ONLY GOT A FEW MINUTES
LEFT, SO LET'S JUST GO...
- LET'S TRY IT.
- COURTNEY,
GOD BLESS HER SOUL,
BUT AIN'T NOBODY GOT
TIME TO BE LEARNING
HOW TO DO PIROUETTES
AND ALL THIS SHIT.
IT'S LIKE, "BITCH, I NEED
TO GET THIS DRESS DONE."
- REHEARSAL
DIDN'T GO SMOOTHLY,
SO NOW THE MOOD IN THE ROOM
IS JUST "FOCUS."
THERE'S NO ROOM FOR ERROR,
BECAUSE THIS CHALLENGE IS GONNA
DETERMINE WHO'S IN THE TOP 4,
AND THE ODDS ARE GETTING
NARROWER AND NARROWER.
- I HATE YOU
SO FUCKING MUCH.
[SIGHS]
- DARIENNE, YOU ALL RIGHT?
- I'M HORRIBLE.
COULDN'T BE WORSE.
- WHAT HAPPENED, DARIENNE?
- WELL, I'M STARTING
OVER AT ZERO.
- CHANGING IT?
- YEAH. I HAVE TO.
I'M GOING WITH
A WHOLE NEW DRESS--
WHOLE NEW FABRIC,
WHOLE NEW EVERYTHING.
I DID A DRESS,
BUT IT'S NOT REALLY SAYING
"DRIPPING IN JEWELS ELEGANZA,"
SO NOW I'M STARTING
ALL OVER AT SQUARE ONE.
WHAT THE FUCK
AM I THINKING?
I'M FUCKED.
- HOW YOU DOING
OVER THERE, ADORE?
- SO FAR,
I THINK SO GOOD.
SO AFTER TALKING TO RU,
IT'S FUCKING DEFINITELY GAME ON.
LIKE NUTS TO THE GUTS,
BALLS TO THE WALLS.
BUT I'M STILL NOT A SEAMSTRESS,
AND JESUS KNOWS THAT,
SO IT'S KIND OF
SO MUCH PRESSURE!
[GROANS]
I WANTED TO JUST
DRENCH THIS IN DIAMONDS.
- WELL, YOU HAVE
A LOT OF RHINESTONES.
- KIND OF, YEAH.
- WHAT ABOUT THAT PRETTY STUFF
UNDER YOUR TABLE?
- THAT?
- YEAH.
- I WAS GONNA USE THAT
AS A TUTU,
BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW.
- WHY DON'T YOU
GATHER THAT UP?
- GATHER IT UP?
- WAIT. I'LL SHOW YOU.
WHAT YOU REALLY COULD DO IS
CUT IT EVENLY TO A LENGTH, OK?
AND GATHER IT ON TOP.
- UH-HUH.
- I THINK ADORE IS STRUGGLING
IN THIS CHALLENGE
BECAUSE SHE REALLY DOESN'T
KNOW HOW TO EXECUTE COSTUMES,
MUCH LESS COUTURE.
SHE CAN'T EVEN SPELL IT.
- YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO CUT IT IN STRIPS
AND JUST GLUE IT
LIKE THAT, RIGHT?
- OH, NO, NOT LIKE THAT.
- IT LOOKS UGLY.
- YEAH, IT DOES.
- I DON'T KNOW HOW TO
MAKE A FUCKING TUTU.
- I LOOK AT ADORE'S DRESS,
AND I'M LIKE, "OK, I THINK
I'M SAFE. THANK GOD."
- OH, YOU MEAN, LIKE,
WRAP IT AND THEN--
I DON'T FUCKING
MAKE CLOTHES.
- ADORE HAS BEEN IN THE BOTTOM
NOT ONCE, BUT TWICE.
SHE'S HERE BY THE SKIN
OF HER TEETH.
IF SHE CAN'T DELIVER
ON ANOTHER CHALLENGE,
IT'S GONNA BE HARD FOR RU
TO KEEP HER IN THE GAME.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
- [LAUGHTER]
- WELCOME TO THE MAIN STAGE
OF "RUPAUL'S DRAG RACE."
MICHELLE VISAGE, ARE YOU READY

- I WAS CONFUSED
BY YOUR BANJEE GIRL.
I LOVED THE OUTFIT.
I'M INTO, LIKE,
HOOCHIE-MAMA IT UP.
I JUST DID NOT GET
THE TULLE.
IT WAS MORE DISTRACTING
THAN ANYTHING.
- AS FAR AS YOUR
EXECUTIVE REALNESS,
THAT'S THE ONE
I HAD A PROBLEM WITH.
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT
YOU'RE GONNA RUN ANY BUSINESS
DRESSED LIKE THAT.
IT WAS A COCKTAIL DRESS.

A BANJEE GIRL LOOK.
YOU KILLED IT.

LOVE THE ATTITUDE.
I WOULD WEAR THOSE BOOTS
AND NOTHING ELSE.

- HONEY, I WOULD, TOO.
- THIS GOOFY THING
YOU HAVE ON NOW IS JUST PERFECT.
YOUR WIG AND YOUR SKIRT
ARE LIKE SISTERS.
THEY LOOK
THE SAME SHAPE EXACTLY.
I JUST LOVED THE WHOLE THING.
IT MADE ME REALLY LAUGH.
- SO DURING THE WALKTHROUGH,
YOU HAD AN EMOTIONAL
BREAKTHROUGH,
AND IT SHOWED ONSTAGE.
- WELL, THE THING IS,
I HAD AN EPIPHANY
WHEN I WAS TAKING A BATHTUB.
I WAS JUST LIKE,
"YOU KNOW WHAT?
LIKE, NO MORE CHIONA SHIT.
YOU'RE IN SEASON 6."
- RIGHT.
- "IT'S GAME TIME."
FUCKING PARTY.
I'M EXCITED.
- ALL RIGHT, UP NEXT,
BIANCA DEL RIO IN SAPPHIRE.
- THAT'S A GOOD DRAG NAME.
SAPPHIRE!
- I LIKE YOUR
EXECUTIVE OUTFIT.
I'VE KNOWN THAT WOMAN.
SHE'S REALLY ALL BUSINESS.
BUT THIS LAST ONE LOOKS, TO ME,
LIKE A BAR MITZVAH MOTHER.
I'D JUST LIKE TO TAKE OFF
AT LEAST ONE OF THOSE
RUFFLED THINGS.
- LAST TIME I WAS HERE,
YOU DID A SIMILAR SILHOUETTE
TO THE DRESS THAT
YOU'RE WEARING NOW.
I WISH I COULD SEE
SOMETHING DIFFERENT.
- NEXT UP,
DARIENNE LAKE IN TOPAZ.
- THE BANJEE GIRL.
- WHAT?
- DARIENNE,
THAT WAS MORE RAVE.
LIKE, THERE WAS
NOTHING STREET TO ME.
EXECUTIVE REALNESS--
DIDN'T BUY THAT EITHER.
WHERE? JIFFY LUBE?
NOW, THIS LOOK--THAT TOPAZ COLOR
LOOKS BEAUTIFUL ON YOU.
WHAT'S BOTHERING ME
IS THAT IT'S DROOPY.
- THOSE JEWELS ARE HEAVY.
- AND YOUR FABRIC
IS STRETCHING.
- THAT'S WHAT IT IS.
- I WAS GOING FOR THAT SORT OF
SLAVE PRINCESS LEIA THING,
BUT I ENDED UP LOOKING MORE LIKE
IF HER AND JABBA HAD A BABY.
- IT'S UNFORTUNATE,
BECAUSE THE CONCEPT IS THERE,
BUT IT WAS JUST NOT A VERY
SUCCESSFUL SET OF LOOKS
THAT WE SAW FROM YOU TONIGHT.
- NEXT UP,
COURTNEY ACT IN RUBIES.
- YOUR BANJEE GIRL--
TO ME, NOT BANJEE.
WHAT WE GOT WAS, LIKE,
"ROCKER CHICK WEARING MY
BOYFRIEND'S FLANNEL SHIRT."
- I HAD GOLD BAMBOO
HOOP EARRINGS, MICHELLE.
- GIRL, BAMBOO EARRINGS
DOES NOT A BANJEE GIRL MAKE,
AND IF YOU'RE GONNA SHIMMY
AND SHOW US YOUR CAKES,
YOU HAVE TO HAVE CAKES.
- THERE WAS PADS IN THERE.
- GIRL, IT WAS SO SMALL.
YOU NEED TO PAD MORE.
- OK.
- GO ROB A COUCH.
- THIS IS MY FAVORITE
OF THE ELEGANZA LOOKS.
IT'S ONE OF THOSE
EFFORTLESSLY CHIC GOWNS
THAT YOU WOULD SEE
ON THE RUNWAY
OF A LOT OF DIFFERENT
DESIGNERS.
- LADIES, I HATE TO TARNISH
THIS SHINING MOMENT,
BUT I MUST ASK,
WHICH ONE OF YOU
SHOULD GO HOME TONIGHT?
- OH, GOD.
- AND WHY?
COMING UP...
- SHE FREQUENTLY ASSUMES
SHE IS DOING BETTER
THAN PEOPLE FROM AN OUTSIDE
PERSPECTIVE MIGHT SEE.
- WHATEVER, QUEEN.
[ENGINE REVS]
- [RUPAUL LAUGHING]
- LADIES, I MUST ASK...
WHICH ONE OF YOU SHOULD
GO HOME TONIGHT, AND WHY?
LET'S START WITH DELA.
- I THINK DARIENNE.
EVERYONE ELSE WHO'S HERE
HAS REALLY SHOWN AN ABILITY
TO HEAR CRITIQUE AND ADJUST,
AND SOME FOLKS, LIKE BIANCA,
JUST SAIL THROUGH,
BUT DARIENNE--
I THINK SHE FREQUENTLY ASSUMES
SHE IS DOING BETTER
THAN PEOPLE FROM AN OUTSIDE
PERSPECTIVE MIGHT SEE.
- ALL RIGHT. THANKS, DELA.
ADORE DELANO.
- I FEEL, BASED ON THIS
CHALLENGE, DARIENNE.
- BIANCA DEL RIO.
- IF IT'S ABOUT THIS
PARTICULAR CHALLENGE,
I WOULD HAVE TO SAY DARIENNE.
AND YOU KNOW I'M NOT
GONNA LIE TO YOU.
- I KNOW.
- WHICH IS WHY
I'M CALLED A BITCH,
AND APPARENTLY
I'M SAILING NOW.
- IS THAT A BAD THING?
- WHATEVER, QUEEN.
- WHY IS THAT AN INSULT?
- I SHOULD PICK YOUR ASS
JUST FOR BEING A CUNT.
- THAT WAS, LIKE,
YOU'RE GOOD AT STUFF.
- YEAH. NO, THAT WAS
VERY CONDESCENDING.
- DARIENNE LAKE,
SAME QUESTION.
- I THINK, "DARIENNE,
"YOU SHOULD REALLY GO HOME
FOR WHAT YOU HAVE DONE TODAY.
THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU DID,
AND REALIZE THE CRITICISMS."
WHO I THINK SHOULD GO HOME?
WHOEVER DOES NOT LIP-SYNC
FOR THEIR LIFE.
- OK, COURTNEY ACT.
- COMING INTO
THIS COMPETITION,
I EARMARKED ADORE
AS BEING TOP 3.
AND OVER
THE LAST FEW WEEKS,
SHE'S KIND OF TRIPPED
AND STUMBLED,
SO I THINK THAT SHE
WOULD BE THE NEXT TO GO,
BUT I GUESS, BASED ON
TONIGHT'S COMMENTS,
I'M GONNA SAY DARIENNE.
- SO YOUR ANSWER IS
ADORE AND DARIENNE?
- [LAUGHTER]
- THANK YOU, LADIES.
WHILE YOU UNWIND IN
THE "UNTUCKED" LOUNGE,
THE JUDGES AND I
WILL DELIBERATE.
JUST BETWEEN US RHINESTONERS,
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
LET'S START WITH BENDELACREME.
- WELL, YOU KNOW, WITH BENDELA,
MY ISSUE IS,
SHE'S NOT MEMORABLE.
I TOTALLY DID NOT EVEN REALIZE
SHE WAS IN THE OPENING ACT,
AND I THINK HOW SHE
MAKES STUFF LOOKS CHEAP.
- I AGREE. MOST OF WHAT SHE WORE
WAS NOT VERY SUCCESSFUL.
I LIKED THE ROSE
QUARTZ THE BEST,
AND I DIDN'T
EVEN LIKE IT.
IT'S LIKE AN OLD
BETTY GRABLE OUTFIT.
- I ACTUALLY THOUGHT
IT WAS CUTE--
KIND OF PONY,
SHOWGIRL LOOK FOR BENDELA,
BUT SOMETHING WE HAVE SEEN
MANY TIMES BEFORE.
AT THIS STAGE IN THE GAME,
I DON'T KNOW IF WE'RE EVER GONNA
GET ANYTHING DIFFERENT
THAN WHAT WE'VE GOTTEN
FROM BENDELA.
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S
MOVE ON DOWN TO ADORE.
- I LOVED ADORE.
ANYONE COULD WEAR AN OUTFIT.
NOT EVERYBODY COULD CARRY IT,
AND I THINK ADORE,
NO MATTER WHAT LOOK SHE DID,
SHE EMBODIED THAT PERSONALITY.
- I AGREE.
I MEAN, IT'S NOT SO MUCH
THAT HER LOOKS
WERE SO MUCH BETTER
THAN EVERYONE ELSE'S,
BUT SHE SOLD THEM TO US.
- YEAH. IT WASN'T JUST
A GIRL IN AN OUTFIT.
I WAS AMUSED
ALL NIGHT BY HER.
- WITH THAT SAID,
I'M NOT SURE I WOULD
HAVE NOTICED ADORE
IN THE OPENING NUMBER IF SHE
HADN'T TRIPPED EVERY TIME.
- MOVING ON, BIANCA DEL RIO.
BOB, I'M SURPRISED YOU DIDN'T
LIKE HER SAPPHIRE DRESS MORE.
- NO, I DIDN'T.
IT WASN'T NEW OR INTERESTING
OR OLD-TIME GLAMOUR, EVEN.
I JUST DIDN'T GET IT.
- BUT THE THINGS
SHE DID THIS WEEK,
NONE OF THEM
WERE SO OFF THE MARK,
AND HER EXECUTION IS
ON POINT TO HER VISION.
- LET'S MOVE ON DOWN
TO DARIENNE LAKE.
- SHE DID A GREAT
MARILYN MONROE,
AND THEN WE DIDN'T
SLOWLY DESCEND.
WE CRASH-LANDED.
- I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT SHE
WAS THINKING FOR, REALLY,
ANY OF THE LOOKS.
THE BANJEE LOOK
IS SO UNFLATTERING.
- AND THEN THE SHOES WERE JUST
THE FRIGGING CHERRY ON TOP.
- WHERE DID YOU BUY THEM--
THE MICHELIN MAN SHOES?
- THROW THEM AWAY.
- BUT SHE'S GOT
A GREAT ATTITUDE.
SHE KNEW THAT
SHE HAD MISSED THE MARK,
AND I'D RATHER THAT THAN
SOMEBODY GO LIKE, "NO,
EVERYTHING I DID WAS GREAT,
AND I'M PERFECT."
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S MOVE ON
TO COURTNEY ACT.
- I'M GETTING, DARE I SAY,
BORED WITH THIS PRETTY THING.
LIKE, THE RED OUTFIT WAS
A PRETTY PIECE OF FABRIC
WITH A PRETTY BRA.
IT'S COASTING NOW.
- SHE DOES RELY ON THAT,
BUT THAT'S WHO SHE IS.
SHE IS BEAUTIFUL.
- $100,000.
GIVE ME SOMETHING.
- YOU KNOW, AS SIMPLE AS
HER ELEGANZA LOOK LOOKS,
IT TOOK TIME IN FINESSING,
AND IT WASN'T JUST...
- I'M SURPRISED
YOU'RE SAYING THAT,
BECAUSE YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO'S LIKE,
"IT'S UNFINISHED, YOU KNOW.
YOU DON'T HAVE A HEM."
- YEAH, BUT SHE...
- HE WANTS TO SAY--
WHATEVER I SAY, THE OPPOSITE.
- NO, I DON'T.
I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU SAY.
I'M JUST SAYING--
I SAY WHATEVER,
BUT I REALLY FEEL
IT'S REALLY FUNNY
HOW YOU REALLY
DISLIKE THAT LOOK.
- I DON'T DISLIKE IT.
I JUST THINK IT'S BASIC.
- SILENCE!
I'VE MADE MY DECISION.
BRING ME MY JEWELS.
[ENGINE REVS]
- [RUPAUL LAUGHING]
- WELCOME BACK, LADIES.
I'VE MADE SOME DECISIONS.
BIANCA DEL RIO,
YOU'RE SAFE.
ADORE DELANO, TONIGHT
YOU HAD AN EPIPHANY,
AND WE HAD A BALL.
CONGRATULATIONS.
YOU'RE THE WINNER OF
THIS WEEK'S CHALLENGE.
- OH, MY GOD.
- YOU'VE WON
A DRAGTASTIC COSTUME
FROM KICKA CUSTOM DESIGNS.
- I JUST WON
A SEWING CHALLENGE.
I'M REALLY, REALLY
PROUD OF MYSELF.
- DARIENNE LAKE.
AS MARILYN,
YOU BOOP-OOP-A-DOOPED,
BUT ON THE RUNWAY,
YOUR ELEGANZA JUST DROOPED.
I'M SORRY, MY DEAR,
BUT YOU ARE UP FOR ELIMINATION.
BENDELACREME, YOUR CLASSIC
DELA SILHOUETTES
DIDN'T KEEP
THE GLITTER BALL ROLLING.
COURTNEY ACT,
YOUR BEAUTY IS FLAWLESS,
BUT YOUR OUTFITS
LACKED CLARITY.
COURTNEY ACT,
YOU'RE SAFE.
YOU MAY JOIN
THE OTHER GIRLS.
BENDELA,
I'M SORRY, MY DEAR,
BUT YOU ARE UP
FOR ELIMINATION.
- I HAVE BEEN IN THIS
EXACT POSITION BEFORE,
LIP-SYNCING AGAINST
DARIENNE LAKE,
BUT WE'RE NOT GONNA GET
SAVED A SECOND TIME.
SOMEBODY IS
GOING HOME TONIGHT.
- TWO QUEENS STAND BEFORE ME.
LADIES, THIS IS YOUR
LAST CHANCE TO IMPRESS ME
AND SAVE YOURSELVES
FROM ELIMINATION.
THE TIME HAS COME FOR YOU
TO LIP-SYNC FOR YOUR LIFE.
GOOD LUCK,
AND DON'T FUCK IT UP.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
- I REALLY, REALLY WANT
TO BE IN THE TOP 4.
I'VE EARNED THIS,
AND I DON'T WANT TO GO HOME.
- THIS SONG IS
SPEAKING TO ME RIGHT NOW.
WOUNDED OR NOT,
I'M GONNA COME BACK SWINGING,
AND THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING.
- WHOO!
- WOW.
LADIES,
I'VE MADE MY DECISION.
DARIENNE LAKE...
SHANTE, YOU STAY.
YOU MAY JOIN
THE OTHER GIRLS.
DELA.
GIRL, I LOVE YOU, AND I EXPECT
GREAT THINGS FROM YOU,
BECAUSE THE CREAM
ALWAYS RISES TO THE TOP.
NOW, SASHAY AWAY.
- [APPLAUSE]
- I'M DISAPPOINTED
TO BE GOING HOME
SOONER THAN
I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO,
BUT I FEEL PROUD OF MYSELF,
AND I'VE LEARNED
A LOT BEING HERE.
RU, YOU TAUGHT ME WHAT
DRAG WAS. THANK YOU.
THANK YOU FOR SEEING
SOMETHING IN ME.
THIS HAS BEEN A PRETTY
INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE.
- MY FINAL 4 QUEENS,
ONE CHALLENGE STANDS
BETWEEN YOU AND VICTORY.
REMEMBER, IF YOU
CAN'T LOVE YOURSELF,
HOW IN THE HELL
YOU GONNA LOVE SOMEBODY ELSE?
CAN I GET AN AMEN IN HERE?
- AMEN!
- ALL RIGHT.
NOW LET THE MUSIC PLAY.
[MUSIC PLAYING]


- ONE YEAR AGO,
IN AN ABANDONED STUDIO,
14 QUEENS WERE TERRORIZED...
- [CRIES]
- [SCREAMS]
- [BABBLES]
- BROKEN DOWN...
- NO!
- AND CA-TORTURED.
SINCE THEN,
EVIL HAS LAIN DORMANT,
UNTIL NOW.
[CACKLING]
[COUGHS]
OH, WHOA.
WHERE'D THAT COME FROM?
THIS SEASON, "RUPAUL'S DRAG
RACE" IS ON THE EDGE OF GORY.
PIG'S BLOOD.
[ALL SCREAM]
- AS 14 UNSPOOKABLE QUEENS...
- BASIC BITCHES NOT WANTED.
- PUT THE FEAR IN FIERCE.
- GAH-AHH-GGING.
- DROP-DEAD GORGEOUS FASHION,
SCARY GOOD CELEBRITIES...
- PUT A CORK IN IT.
- AND SOME CRAZY, PSYCHO...
- OH, NO, GIRL.
- BITCHES.
[CRASHES]
- WHAT'S--WHAT'S GOING ON?
- I WILL SHOW YOU VERSATILITY
WHEN SANTINO WINS
A SEWING COMPETITION
AND VISAGE WEARS
A FUCKING TURTLENECK!
- BUT DON'T BE SCARED.
THERE'S TEARS AS WELL AS FEARS.
- I'VE GIVEN UP EVERYTHING
IN MY LIFE TO BE A DRAG QUEEN.
- YOU HAVE OVERCOME THAT,
AND I'M SO PROUD TO SEE IT.
I'M SO PROUD TO SEE IT.
SO GET READY
TO GET SCARED SILLY.
- BITCHING.
- "RUPAUL'S DRAG RACE"
IS BACK.
AND MAY THE BEST WOMAN...
[SCREAMS]
[LAUGHING]
- I'M HOME!
FUCK, YEAH.
I'M THE FIRST ONE.
MY NAME IS ADORE DELANO.
I'M 23 YEARS OLD,
AND I'M A FUCKING LIBRA.
I'M SO EXCITED, I CAN PEE.
I DON'T FIT IN WITH SOCIETY.
I DON'T FIT IN
WITH THE DRAG QUEENS.
OH.
FOR ALL THE QUEENS TELLING ME
THAT I'M NOT POLISHED ENOUGH,
I JUST WANT THEM TO KNOW
THAT I'M POLISH REMOVER, BITCH.
I'M NOT WEARING ANY UNDERWEAR.
- HI, EVERYBODY.
IT'S ME, BENDELACREME.
[GIGGLES]
OH, THERE'S ONE.
MY NAME IS BENDELACREME,
AND I'M 31 YEARS OLD.
- BENDELACREME?
- YES, DELA FOR SHORT,
DUH FOR SHORTER,
MISS CREME, IF YOU'RE NASTY.
- PARTY.
- BENDELACREME IS
EFFERVESCENT AND OPTIMISTIC.
WOW, THIS IS BEAUTIFUL!
I REFER TO HER
AS "TERMINALLY DELIGHTFUL."
OH!
SO POSITIVE THAT SHE
COULD CAUSE DEATH AT ANY MOMENT.
WELL, I'M GONNA PARK
RIGHT NEXT TO YOU.
WE'RE ALREADY
THE BEST OF FRIENDS.
- WHAT'S YOUR SIGN?
- OH, I NEVER GOT ONE OF THOSE.
[WHISPERING]
WHO IS THAT?
- MY NAME IS GIA GUNN.
I'M 23 YEARS OLD.
GIA'S A FISHY GIRL.
SHE'S C.C.C.,
CRAZY CUCKOO CUNT.
JUST GOT OFF THE BOAT.
YOU KNOW, LITTLE TRIP FROM ASIA.
JUST LANDED LIKE FRESH TILAPIA.
- [LAUGHS]
GIA CAME OUT WITH A HULA-HOOP
WITH A POCKET ON IT.
I MEAN, SHE WAS REALLY
LIVING FOR HERSELF, GIRL.
- I FEEL LIKE YOU'RE
GONNA KIND OF BE, LIKE,
MAYBE THE MOTHERLY FIGURE.
- THE MOTHER--CALLED ME OLD.
ALL RIGHT.
- OH, Y'ALL WANTED A TWIST, EH?
COME ON, SEASON 6.
LET'S GET SIX-Y.
YEAH.
- YES, BITCH.
WORK.
- MY NAME IS LAGANJA ESTRANJA.
I'M 24 YEARS OLD.
HI, GIRLS.
- HI!
- LAGANJA IS KNOWN FOR HER WILD
AND AMAZING DANCE ABILITY.
OH, WHOO!
- OH, DAMN!
- SHE'S GHETTO, BUT SHE'S ALSO
CLASSY AND GLAMOROUS.
- BITCH. BITCH.
- OH, SO Y'ALL KNOW EACH OTHER.
- WE STARTED TOGETHER
AT THE SAME CLUB.
LAGANJA AND I ARE
THE BEST OF FRIENDS,
BUT WHEN WE DO COMPETE,
THAT CAN GET UGLY.
SHE'S VERY COMPETITIVE.
- GIRL, IT'S ABOUT TIME THEY GOT
SOME FRESH FISH UP IN HERE.
- YES, MA'AM.
- SUSHI ROLL, SUSHI ROLL!
- BARF.
- [GASPS]
- REPORTING FOR DUTY.
APRIL CARRION IS IN THE HOUSE.
- YEAH!
- I'M APRIL CARRION.
I'M 24 YEARS OLD,
DIRECTLY FROM GUAYNABO,
PUERTO RICO.
- AND HERE I THOUGHT GAYS
WEREN'T ALLOWED IN THE SCOUTS.
- APRIL IS A CROSS
BETWEEN BJORK AND COCO ROCHA.
WHAT'S UP, GIRLS?
YOU KNOW, SOMETHING WEIRD,
BUT SOMETHING GLAMOROUS.
- YOU JUST PARACHUTED IN, GIRL?
- I'M NOT TOO SURE
ABOUT APRIL'S LOOK,
BECAUSE IT'S GIVING ME
A LITTLE BIT OF BUTCH,
BUT, UH, SHE'S CUTE.
NO.
- [LAUGHS]
- HEY, BITCHES.
Y'ALL READY TO ROCK AND ROLL?
WHOO!
OH, SHIT.
I NEED TO PUT THESE BACK ON.
- OH!
- NO, I'M JUST KIDDING.
- OH!
- I'M JUST KIDDING.
I'M KELLY MANTLE.
I'M 37 YEARS OLD.
MWAH. WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
- LOVELY TO MEET YOU.
LAGANJA.
- GORGEOUS.
I AM AN ACTOR.
I'VE BEEN ON A BUNCH
OF TELEVISION SHOWS,
BUT I PROMISE I'M NOT
GONNA WALK AROUND RECITING
MY IMDB PAGE LIKE SOME PEOPLE
WE KNOW FROM PAST SEASONS.
- NICE TO MEET YOU, SWEETIE.
- GIA GUNN, NICE TO MEET YOU.
- ABSOLUTELY.
KELLY LOOKED A MESS.
THE LOOK WAS NOTHING
TO GAG OVER.
GLOWING HEARTS ON A SIMPLE DRESS
IS NOT GIVING ME DRAG.
- THIS IS AWESOME.
OH!
- GIRL, WHAT?
AN ALIEN?
- YES.
YES, MAMA.
COME ON.
- PULL IT DOWN, BABY.
- LET US SEE.
- IT WAS ALL DRAMATIC,
AND THEN IT WAS JUST...
- YEAH!
- I'M VIVACIOUS.
I'M 40 YEARS OLD.
MOTHER HAS ARRIVED.
- YES.
[ALL TALKING AT ONCE]
- VIVACIOUS IS THE LAST ORIGINAL
CLUB KID IN NEW YORK CITY.
- I'M LIVING FOR THIS HEAD.
- YES.
- GIVE ME SOME HEAD
RIGHT ABOUT NOW.
- MY LOOK IS
LEIGH BOWERY ABSTRACT ENTITY.
VIVACIOUS IS LIVING ART.
I CANNOT WAIT TO SEE
WHO THE NEXT GIRL IS, HONEY.
- I WONDER
IF SHE'S GONNA BE AS FIERCE
AS ALL OF US OR MORE MANLY.
- [LAUGHS]
[SIREN WAILING]
[ALL HOOTING]
- YOU GOT SHE MAIL.
- SHE MAIL.
- ALREADY?
- WAIT A MINUTE.
THERE'S ONLY 7 OF US.
- THERE HAS TO BE
MORE GIRLS COMING.
- WHOO!
- DOES THAT MEAN
THIS IS ALL OF US?
WHO CAN COUNT THIS HIGH?
IS THIS ENOUGH?
- NO, HONEY.
THERE HAS TO BE MORE.
- WE INTERRUPT THIS KIKI
TO BRING YOU A SPECIAL BULLETIN.
THIS SEASON,
THE DRAG REVOLUTION
WILL BE TELEVISED,
SO DON'T ADJUST YOUR SETS,
BECAUSE THIS EXTRAVAGANZA
IS BEING BROADCAST IN H.D.S.
THAT'S HIGH-DEFINITION SHADE.
MM-HMM.
WE NOW RETURN TO OUR REGULARLY
SCHEDULED COMPETITION
ALREADY IN PROGRESS.
[ALL WHOOPING]
- HELLO, HELLO, HELLO!
- [CHEERS]
- HI!
- WELCOME TO
"RUPAUL'S DRAG RACE."
NOW, LET'S SEE.
IS THERE ANYONE MISSING?
UM, LET'S SEE.
UM, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
7, THAT'S IT!
- 7 OF US.
I MEAN, IS THERE
NO BUDGET THIS TIME AROUND?
- BECAUSE, FOR THE FIRST TIME,
WE'RE NOT HAVING
JUST ONE PREMIERE.
WE'RE HAVING TWO.
YOU ARE THE FIRST 7
QUEENS TO ARRIVE.
THIS WEEK, YOU'LL BE
COMPETING AGAINST EACH OTHER,
AND ONE OF YOU
WILL BE GOING HOME.
NEXT WEEK, IT'S PART TWO,
AS 7 NEW QUEENS ARRIVE.
BECAUSE THE ONLY THING BETTER
THAN ONE BIG OPENING
IS TWO BIG OPENINGS.
- YES, MAMA.
- THIS WAY, NO ONE CAN GET
LOST IN THE CROWD.
- THERE'S 7 OF US,
AND THERE'S A FUCKING CLOSER EYE
BEING WATCHED ON US.
I'M FUCKING SCARED.
- BUT IF YOU PLAY BIG,
YOU CAN WIN BIG.
THE WINNER OF
"RUPAUL'S DRAG RACE"
WILL RECEIVE A SICKENING SUPPLY
OF COLOREVOLUTION COSMETICS.
- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
- OOH, YES, MAMA.
- AND I'LL BE CUTTING
A BIG, FAT CHECK...
FOR $100,000.
- [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
- NO MORE STREET CORNERS.
- OKAY.
- THIS WEEK, WE'RE
GOING TO CELEBRATE EVERYTHING
WE LOVE ABOUT THE BOOB TUBE.
HASHTAG "ALLTVALLSHADE."
- OH.
- OKAY.
- STARTING
WITH YOUR FIRST PHOTO SHOOT.
- [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
- IT'S TIME TO TAKE
A FLYING LEAP INTO SEASON 6.

[LAUGHS]
- IT'S SEASON 6, HONEY,
AND SHIT'S GETTING GAGGY.
- COMING UP...
- [SHOUTING]
- ARE YOU OKAY?
[LAUGHING]
[LAUGHING]
- ADORE, MY DARLING.
- HI, RU.
- SAY HELLO TO CELEBRITY
PHOTOGRAPHER MIKE RUIZ.
- HI.
- AND LET ME INTRODUCE
THE NEW AND IMPROVED PIT CREW.
THEY'RE BUFF, THEY'RE TOUGH,
AND BROUGHT TO YOU BY THE GAY
SOCIAL NETWORK SCRUFF.
- PARTY.
- NOW, TO PROVE
YOU'RE NOT THE BIGGEST LOSER,
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS TAKE A QUANTUM LEAP
AND STRIKE A SICKENING POSE
IN THE MIDDLE
OF THIS GIANT TV SCREEN.
- OH, SHIT.
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO.
- WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR
FROM THE GIRLS IN THIS CHALLENGE
IS AMAZING FACE, DANCER-LY BODY
MOVES, AND CONFIDENCE.
- I'M REALLY SCARED THAT I MIGHT
FLY OFF THIS FUCKING THING,
AND HEELS ARE
GONNA GO FLYING HERE,
AND EYELASHES
ARE GONNA BE ON MY CHIN.
- ALL RIGHT, KIDDO.
DON'T BE NERVOUS.
I'M GONNA TALK YOU
OFF THE LEDGE.
- THIS SHIT
IS NOT LIKE THE BUSINESS.
- WHENEVER YOU'RE READY.
- OKAY, READY?
- YOU'RE GONNA
COUNT IT OFF, RIGHT?
- OKAY, READY?
1, 2, 3.
- [LAUGHING]
- MY EYELASH.
- YEAH, THAT
WAS A LITTLE AWKWARD.
- OKAY.
- DO PRETTY LEGS.
LIKE, DO, YOU KNOW,
LIKE, A DANCER-LY THING.
[CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING]
- [YELPS]
- YOU DID IT AGAIN
WITH THE LEGS.
- OH, I'M SORRY.
I'M A GIRAFFE!
- ADORE LOOKED LIKE
HER LIMBS WERE ALL BROKEN,
BUT SHE GAVE
REALLY AMAZING FACE.
- THIS IS LIKE AN EPISODE
OF QUEER FACTOR.
BENDELACREME,
YOU'RE ON AIR IN 3, 2, 1...
[CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING]
[LAUGHS]
- YOUR BODY WAS GOOD,
BUT YOUR FACE
WAS A LITTLE EXTREME.
LET'S JUST DO A PRETTY ONE NOW.
- OOH, YES.
- OH, YEAH.
- HERE'S TO THE LADIES
WHO LAUNCH.
GIA GUNN.
- CHECK OUT
THE SIZE OF THAT SACK.
- [LAUGHS]
NOW, ON TODAY'S SHORT FLIGHT,
WE'LL BE SERVING FISH.
[CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING]
[LAUGHS]
QUEEN DOWN.
- WAS THAT GOOD?
- WELL, NO, BUT YOU
CAN TRY IT AGAIN.
- OKAY.
I HAVE NO FUCKING IDEA
WHAT I'M DOING.
I KNOW WE'RE TRYING
TO GIVE BODY AND MUG,
BUT I'M JUST SO SCARED
OF SNAPPING MY NECK.
- G-G-G-GIA.
[LAUGHING]
- WAS THAT BETTER?
- I REALLY THOUGHT YOU'D
BE BETTER AT GOING DOWN.
- [CHUCKLES]
- GIA MAY BE FISH,
BUT SHE AIN'T FLYING FISH.
- LAGANJA!
- YES.
- COME ON DOWN.
[CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING]
- YES!
- [LAUGHS]
YOU LOOK JUST
LIKE GOLDIE HAWN IN OVERBOARD.
- OH, I GET THAT A LOT.
- IF YOU CAN GO
A LITTLE BIT HIGHER
AND A LITTLE BIT FURTHER OUT.
- OKAY.
- QUEEN OVERBOARD.
- YES, GORGEOUS.
- SHE'S GIVING YOU
A YOUNG JULIANNE "HOWE."
- OH, YEAH, JULIANNE...
[COUGHING THROATILY] HOUGH.
- KELLY MANTLE.
- 1, 2...
3.
[CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING]
- OH.
- IT'S VERY DOROTHY
IN THE WIZARD OF OZ,
LIKE, WHEN SHE WAS
IN THE TORNADO.
- [LAUGHING]
- YOU GOT ONE MORE CHANCE.
- YOU GOT ONE MORE TRY.
[CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING]
- THERE'S NO PLACE LIKE FOAM.
APRIL CARRION.
- TRES, DOS, UNO.
[CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING]
- [LAUGHS]
I AM LOVING
THIS NEW FALL SEASON.
- AH! I CAN'T GET OUT.
- IT'S THE BOOGIE
WOOGIE BUGLE QUEEN.
- WE TOTALLY GOT THE SHOT.
- VIVACIOUS.
THERE ARE TWO THINGS
I LOVE ABOUT YOU:
YOUR FACE.
- [LAUGHS]
- LET'S GO.
DO YOU HAVE A NAME FOR THE HEAD
ON TOP OF YOUR HEAD?
- ORNACIA.
- ORNACIA, OKAY.
I BELIEVE YOU CAN FLY.
[CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING]
OH, NO, YOU CAN'T.
- [LAUGHS]
- [GROANS]
- ORNACIA WAS GIVING ME FACE,
BUT YOU, NOT SO MUCH.
[CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS]
- OH, BOY.
ARE YOU OKAY?
- UH-HUH.
- WE GOT A GOOD SHOT.
I KNOW IT'S A LOT
TO WRAP YOUR HEAD AROUND.
[LAUGHTER]
- OH, MY GOODNESS. MISTAKE.
- YOU DID NOT JUMP
WITH THAT HEAD ON.
- YES, I DID, HONEY.
- NO!
- YOU GIRLS LOOK
DIFFERENT AS MEN, HONEY.
- YES.
- DELA DEFINITELY DOES NOT LOOK
THE SAME OUT OF DRAG.
I COULD NOT CLOCK THE SPOOK.
- WELL, I'M TRYING TO GIVE A
LOOK, STROLLING ACROSS THE ROOM.
- BUT GIA IS STILL
A LADY BOY IN OR OUT OF GEISH.
- I FEEL SO FREE,
LIKE FREE WILLY.
- LOOKING AROUND THE ROOM,
THERE'S A LOT OF YOUNG QUEENS.
VIVACIOUS AND I
ARE PROBABLY THE OLDER ONES.
I'M SURE SHE'S OLDER,
BUT, YOU KNOW...
- THIS IS, LIKE,
MY 21st YEAR DOING DRAG.
- 22 YEARS?
- 21.
- I HAVE BEEN IN DRAG
FOR 17 YEARS.
- OOH, YOU BETTER DO IT.
- YOU CAN NEVER
STOP LEARNING, YOU KNOW,
IF YOU NEVER STOP
STUDYING YOUR CRAFT.
- KELLY'S DRAG CALIBER
IS JUST NOT
TO WHERE I WOULD EXPECT IT
TO BE FOR AN EXPERIENCED QUEEN.
IF IT'S JUST NOT GIVING IT,
MAYBE IT'S JUST NOT FOR YOU.
- THAT IS SO CUTE.
- OH, THANK YOU.
HOW IS SHE, THOUGH?
- GIRL, WHAT?
- HOW IS SHE, THOUGH?
- FUCK ALL THE WAY OFF.
ALL THESE GIRLS HAVE
THESE CRAZY RHINESTONE DRESSES,
AND I BROUGHT,
LIKE, FOUR GOWNS WITH ME,
SO THAT IS MAKING ME VERY
INSECURE AT THIS MOMENT IN TIME.
- HELLO, HELLO, HELLO.
- HELLO!
- HI!
- I JUST FINISHED BINGE-VIEWING
YOUR ON-AIR PHOTOS.
- OH, HONEY.
- AND A COUPLE OF YOU FIZZLED,
BUT ONE OF YOU
IS A TRUE FALLING STAR.
THE WINNER IS...
LAGANJA ESTRANJA.
[APPLAUSE AND LAUGHTER]
- OOH! HONEY, THESE LEGS
ARE EVERYTHING.
- CONDRAGULATIONS, LAGANJA.
- THANK YOU, RU.
- OH, MY GOD.
I TOTALLY FORGOT
I AM DOUBLE-PARKED.
GIRLS, FOLLOW ME.
[TRUCK BEEPING]
[HORN BLARES]
- RUPAUL'S STORAGE WHORES?
- OH.

[ALL TALKING AT ONCE]

- OOH, SHIT
GODDAMN MOTHERFUCK.
- [LAUGHING]
[LAUGHING]
DO YOU WANT TO MEET
THE OTHER 7 QUEENS?
- [SQUEALS]
[ALL TALKING AT ONCE]
- WELL, FIRST,
YOU'LL HAVE TO SURVIVE
THIS WEEK'S MAIN CHALLENGE.
- OH.
- THESE BOXES CONTAIN ITEMS
INSPIRED BY
SOME OF TV'S GREATEST HITS.
- YES.
- OKAY.
- NOW, USING THE JUNK
FROM ONE OF THESE TRUNKS,
YOU NEED TO CREATE YOUR BEST
HIGH-FASHION DRAG LOOK.
- OOH.
- LAGANJA, YOU
WON THE MINI CHALLENGE,
SO YOU GET TO ASSIGN
ONE BOX TO EACH QUEEN.
- I'M GOING TO CHOOSE
"DANCING WITH THE STARS."
- GOOD CHOICE.
- OKAY, MISS APRIL,
I'M THINKING,
BECAUSE OF YOUR ENTRANCE LOOK,
YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO TAKE
"DUCK DYNASTY" AND MAKE IT WORK.
- [LAUGHS]
- OH, REALLY?
- "DUCK DYNASTY."
IS THAT FOR REAL?
[SIGHS]
- GIA, DARLING.
I'M GONNA GO WITH "KEEPING UP
WITH THE KARDASHIANS."
- THANK YOU.
- WHAT ABOUT VIVACIOUS?
- "THE GAME OF THRONES."
- OOH!
- WHAT DO YOU HAVE FOR ADORE?
- I'M WHISPERING "GOLDEN GIRLS."
LIKE...[WHISPERING]
"GOLDEN GIRLS."
- FOR MY SISTER,
I THINK I WOULD LIKE TO GO WITH
"HERE COMES HONEY BOO BOO."
- OH, YOU FUCKING BITCH!
- REALLY?
- ANSWER "GOLDEN GIRLS."
- OH, SHIT.
I'M SORRY, MAMA.
- OH, NO!
IT'S FUCKED UP, MAN.
IT'S FUCKED UP.
- WHAT DO YOU HAVE
FOR KELLY MANTLE?
- I THINK I'M GOING
TO GO WITH THE "DOWNTON ABBEY."
- WELL, THAT MEANS
THAT BENDELACREME GETS...
"GOLDEN GIRLS."
- THANK YOU FOR BEING A FRIEND.
- YES!
- GENTLEMEN, START YOUR ENGINES,
AND MAY THE BEST WOMAN WIN.
- YES.
[APPLAUSE]
- OH, MY GOSH.
WHAT DO YOU THINK WE GOT?
- [GROANS]
- OOH, SHE GOT
SOME FEATHERS, GIRL.
- LAGANJA, YOU HOOKED ME UP.
- THANKS, MAMA, FOR BEING
SO FISHY TO THE FISH.
- IT'S ALL REDNECK STUFF.
IT'S CRAP.
I GOT A BOX FULL OF CRAP.
WHAT IS THIS?
CRAP.
LIKE, LITERALLY CRAP.
- HOW ARE YOU, APRIL?
DO YOU HATE ME YET?
- WHY WOULD LAGANJA THINK
I CAN RELATE TO THIS?
TOTAL CRAP.
[SIGHS]
- SHE'S FUCKED.
- SKETTI.
I'M NOT HAPPY THAT LAGANJA
GAVE ME "HONEY BOO BOO."
I'M SORRY.
THIS SMELLS SO GROSS.
I DON'T KNOW
IF IT'S HER STRATEGY.
I'M GONNA HEAVE.
AND IF SHE DID
THAT ON PURPOSE, THEN...
KARMA.
- HELLO, HELLO, HELLO.
- HELLO!
- HI!
- HERE COMES HONEY RU RU.
- [LAUGHING] YEAH.
- ADORE.
- HI.
- DARLING.
YOU WATCH "HONEY BOO BOO"?
- I DO, BUT I WASN'T HAPPY
THAT I GOT THIS.
- YOU WERE ALSO A CONTESTANT
ON "AMERICAN IDOL."
- YEAH.
- HOW DOES THIS EXPERIENCE
COMPARE SO FAR?
- IT'S SO CRAZY.
- WAIT, WHICH IS CRAZY?
- THIS IS CRAZY.
- [LAUGHS]
- WHEN I WAS 17,
I APPEARED ON "AMERICAN IDOL."
I MADE IT TO THE TOP 13.
I'M PROUD OF IT, BUT I LOOK LIKE
A LESBIAN JONAS BROTHER.
- NOW, DO YOU SEW?
- NO.
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND
YOU YOUNG QUEENS
WHO DON'T KNOW HOW TO SEW.
I DON'T GET THAT.
- I KNOW.
I'LL GLUE IT OR SOMETHING.
- YEAH.
- I'M VERY, LIKE,
PASSIONATE ABOUT THIS.
- BABY, I THINK YOU'D BETTER
CHUG-A-LUG SOME GO-GO
JUICE REAL QUICK
AND MAKE IT HAPPEN.
- [CRIES]
- VIVACIOUS.
- HI, RU, HOW ARE YOU?
- HI, DARLING.
NOW, "GAME OF THRONES."
YOU EVER WATCH THAT SHOW?
- YES, I THINK
IT WAS THE QUEEN'S DAUGHTER
WENT TO ONE
OF THE OTHER KINGDOMS,
AND SHE TURNED AROUND
AND HAD HER DRAGON TORCH
THE WHOLE KINGDOM.
SO, I'M JUST GONNA
TRY TO GET THIS AS FEMININE
AS I POSSIBLY CAN WITH A COWL
NECK AND A BABY DRAGON.
- A BABY DRAGON.
YEAH, OKAY.
WELL, WE WANT TO SEE
"GAME OF THRONES" TRANSLATED
THROUGH YOUR EYES.
GIRL, IT'S GOT TO SCREAM
"VIVACIOUS."
KELLY MANTLE.
- HEY, RU.
- YOU REMIND ME...
- UH-HUH.
- OF A YOUNG CAROL BURNETT.
- [SIGHS]
SHE WAS MY CHILDHOOD IDOL.
SHE'S THE WHOLE REASON
I EVEN STARTED PERFORMING.
- REALLY?
- OH, YEAH.
- SO YOU GOT "DOWNTON ABBEY."
I SEE SOME SORT OF ANTIQUE LACE.
WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO FOR THE TOP?
- THIS WAS IN THE BOX,
AND I STARTED THINKING,
"THIS WOULD MAKE
SUCH AN AMAZING CORSET."
VERY KATE MOSS-Y.
- YEAH.
LISTEN, YOU USE
THE EXPERIENCE THAT YOU HAVE...
- OKAY.
- AND BRING IT
TO THIS CHALLENGE.
- I WILL.
- APRIL. HOW ARE YOU?
- HI, RU.
- YOU GOT "DUCK DYNASTY."
- YEAH.
I FOUND THESE PANTS.
- OH, YEAH, THEY'RE SORT OF
CAMOUFLAGE PANTS.
- I THINK I'M
GONNA REALLY TAILOR THESE
INTO A HIGH-WAISTED PANT
JUST TO MAKE IT HIGH-FASHION,
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE A PANT CAN BE
HARD TO TRANSLATE
INTO HIGH FASHION.
- YEAH, IT CAN BE.
- YEAH.
- ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE A MAN.
- WELL, I THINK
YOU NEED TO TAKE A RISK.
- HMM, OKAY.
- I'M SCARED SHITLESS.
I'M NOT GONNA LIE, YOU KNOW?
I CAN'T BE
THE FIRST QUEEN TO GO HOME.
- G-G-G-GIA.
- HI, RU.
- YOU GOT THE KARDASHIANS.
- ABSOLUTELY.
- NOW, YOU SEEM
A LITTLE BIT BEHIND.
- I NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT I
HAVE THE IDEA TOGETHER FIRST.
- RIGHT.
- SO I'M THINKING, UM,
SOME TYPE OF COLLAR
AND MAYBE SOMETHING,
YOU KNOW, LIKE, COMING UP HERE.
MAYBE SOMETHING FLOW-Y,
BUT I'M THINKING
I'M GONNA GO MAYBE,
LIKE, VERY GOWN-ISH.
MAYBE, LIKE, A DRESS?
- I DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT YOU...[LAUGHING]
WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO.
AND I'M WORRIED
THAT YOU DON'T EITHER.
- OOF, RU JUST CLOCKED ME.
- ALL RIGHT, LISTEN.
I'M GONNA LET
YOU GET BACK TO WORK.
- OKAY.
- ALL RIGHT, SEE YOU.
- THANK YOU.
- ALL RIGHT, LADIES.
GATHER ROUND.
LATER, YOU'LL BE
MAKING YOUR MAIN STAGE DEBUT,
AND WE'LL BE JOINED
BY OUR EXTRA SPECIAL
GUEST JUDGE,
MY AMERICAN IDOL, ADAM LAMBERT.
- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
- SO DON'T FUCK IT UP.
- THE STAKES ARE HIGH.
- I CAN'T EVEN THINK PROPERLY.
- GIRL. THE FIRST QUEEN
GOES HOME TODAY,
AND NO ONE WANTS TO BE
THAT GIRL.
- HOW DO YOU TAKE THIS OFF?
SO, I MAY HAVE OR MAY HAVE NOT
GLUED MY GARMENT
TO MY MANNEQUIN.
THIS IS SO HORRIBLE.
AAH!
I'M FUCKING RIPPING
MY WHOLE DRESS.
- YOU GOOD, BABY?
- GO AHEAD, BABE.
I'LL COME ONCE I GET IT.
- I MAKE ONE ATTEMPT TO HELP
THE BITCH GET THE ENSEMBLE OFF
OF THE MANNEQUIN.
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE!
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE FUCK I'M GONNA DO.
THESE BITCHES ARE
BASICALLY READY AT THIS POINT.
I'M FREAKING THE FUCK OUT.
FUCK!
- [LAUGHING]
[LAUGHING]
[APPLAUSE]
- WELCOME TO THE MAIN STAGE OF
AMERICA'S GOT CHARISMA,
UNIQUENESS, NERVE, AND TALENT.
[LAUGHTER]
HELLO TO THE STAR
OF TWO AND A HALF BOOBS,
MICHELLE VISAGE.
[LAUGHTER]

SHAKE THE DICE

IT'S SANTINO.
WELCOME BACK, BABY.

AND THEY SAY IT'S RU.
- [LAUGHS]
AND MIKE RUIZ.
DID YOU FALL
FOR ANY OF MY GIRLS YESTERDAY?
- I DID. I FELL HARD.
- [LAUGHS]
AND PRESIDENT
OF THE GLAMBERT NATION,
ADAM LAMBERT IS HERE.
YOU LOOK REALLY GOOD TONIGHT.
- OH, THANK YOU! SO DO YOU.
- OH, THANK YOU.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
AFTER THE SHOW?
- ANYTHING YOU WANT.
[LAUGHS]
- [LAUGHS]
FOR THIS WEEK'S BIG OPENING,
WE CHALLENGED OUR FIRST 7 QUEENS
TO TAKE LEFTOVERS
FROM TV'S GREATEST HITS
AND CREATE
THEIR VERY OWN RUNWAY COUTURE.
GENTLEMEN, START YOUR ENGINES,
AND MAY THE BEST WOMAN WIN.
G-G-G-GIA.
"KEEPING UP
WITH THE KARDASHIANS."
KEEPING UP
WITH THE KAR-DAY-SHIANS.
- [LAUGHS]
- SO I'M THE FIRST ONE OUT
ON THE RUNWAY.
I'M READY TO SET
THAT TONE FOR THOSE BITCHES
THAT HAVE TO FOLLOW ME.
MY LEGS ARE BRONZED
AND TANNED FOR THE GODS,
SERVING UP KIM K. REALNESS.
- IS THAT THE LONG-LOST SISTER
MEI LING KARDASHIAN?
- YES.
- KIMORA LEE KAR-DAY-SHIAN.
- OH.
- APRIL CARRION,
SERVING "TUCK DYNASTY."
- [LAUGHS]
- [QUACKS]
- IS THAT A DECOY IN HER POCKET,
OR IS SHE JUST HAPPY TO SEE ME?
[LAUGHTER]
- I'M WALKING ON THE RUNWAY
FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER,
AND I'M ROCKING IT.
I CAN SEE ADAM LAMBERT
WATCHING ME STYLE.
HE WANTS SOME CHICKEN LEGS.
I KNOW IT.
- TAKING HER DUCK OUT
FOR A DRAG.
[LAUGHTER]
- LAGANJA ESTRANJA,
SERVING
"DANCING WITH THE STARS."
NOMI MALONE, SHOWGIRLS.
VERY QUEEN OF THE NIGHT.
WHITNEY, WHERE'S YOUR BODYGUARD?
OH, SHE'S GOING THAT WAY.
[LAUGHTER]
- THEY CAN'T HANDLE ME.
IT'S LEG FOR DAYS,
TRAIN FOR MONTHS,
AND FACE FOR YEARS.
- WHOA!
- HEY, SOLID GOLD.
KELLY MANTLE.
NOW, SHE'S DOING
"DOWNTON ABBEY."
- CHRISTINE BARANSKI'S
IN THE HOUSE.
[LAUGHTER]
- I'VE GOT MY HAIR.
I'VE GOT MY MAKEUP DID.
I'VE GOT MY 28-INCH WAIST.
OKAY? I AM WORKING IT
LIKE A NINETIES RUNWAY MODEL.
- THERE'S SOME
KRISTEN WIIG-Y IN THERE.
- SHE GETTING WIIG-Y WITH IT?
- UH-OH, HEY.
- [LAUGHING]
- ADORE DELANO,
HONEY BOO BOO CHILD.
- HONEY CHILD.
- I'D BET $100,000
WOULD MAKE HER HOLLER.
- [LAUGHS]
- I'M SCARED.
I LOOK LIKE A FUCKING MESS,
BUT I DO NOT WANT TO GO HOME,
SO I NEED TO SELL THIS GARMENT
LIKE IT'S
A 2004 HEATHERETTE SHOW.
- SHH, IT'S A WIG.
[LAUGHTER]
REPRESENTING
"THE GAME OF THRONES,"
VIVACIOUS.
- OOH.
- HEY.
- MARY J. IN THE HOUSE.
- THAT'S RIGHT.
"GAME OF THRONES" IN THE 411.
[LAUGHTER]
- I AM WALKING DOWN THAT RUNWAY,
AND I AM SERVING IT DOWN,
MISS THING.
I AM GIVING YOU OLD-SCHOOL STYLE
NEW YORK WALK, WALK, WALK, POSE.
- WHAT TIME IS IT ON YOUR CROW?
- WELCOME TO HER QUEENDOM.
AIN'T NO RED WEDDING HERE.
- UH-UH.
- UH-UH.
BENDELACREME,
SERVING "GOLDEN GIRLS."
MICHELLE VISAGE.
- BITCH STOLE YOUR LOOK!
- [LAUGHING]
- BENDELACREME VISAGE.
- IT'S MY FIRSTBORN.
- I'M GIVING BENDELACREME
IN HER FULL GLORY.
I'M GIVING THEM THE SEX APPEAL,
BUT I'M ALSO GIVING THEM
THE CAMP AND THE FUN
AND THE GOOFINESS.
- CHEESECAKE.
- MMM, EAT IT.
COMING UP...
- I FELT LIKE IT WAS BOY.
- YOU'RE TRIPPING.
- THAT SKIRT IS HORRIBLE.
- HIDEOUS.
- [LAUGHING]
[LAUGHING]
WELCOME, LADIES.
IT'S TIME
FOR THE JUDGES' CRITIQUES.
FIRST UP, G-G-GIA GUNN.
- I THINK YOUR LOOK IS
WELL-ASSEMBLED.
YOUR HAIR IS FLAWLESS.
- I COULD TELL
THAT YOU'RE THE FEISTY ONE.
- ABSOLUTELY.
- ONE THING I WANT YOU
TO BE CONSCIOUS OF: A BOOTY
WITH AN OPEN LEG CUTS YOUR LEG.
- ABSOLUTELY.
- I LIKE THE BOOTY.
- THANK YOU, GIA.
- ABSOLUTELY.
- APRIL CARRION, I'M
VERY EXCITED THAT YOU CHANGED
YOUR MIND
ABOUT THAT PAIR OF PANTS.
- THE PANTS WEREN'T FITTING,
AND I LOOKED
LIKE A CRAZY MAN, REALLY.
- [LAUGHS]
- YOU DID A REALLY
AMAZING JOB AT TAKING
HYPER-MASCULINE ELEMENTS
AND MAKING A FEMININE LOOK.
- YOU ARE GORGEOUS.
- WELL, YOU'RE GORGEOUS AS WELL.
- OH, THANK YOU.
- GET A ROOM.
[LAUGHTER]
- UP NEXT, LAGANJA ESTRANJA.
- HEY, GIRL.
- LAGANJA, YOU'RE
TRIPPING ON THE SKIRT.
- OKAY.
- ALSO LOST YOUR NECKLINE
COMPLETELY.
- RIGHT.
- I'M KIND OF LOVING HOW
YOUR HAIR BLENDS INTO THE TOP.
I THINK IT'S INTERESTING.
- ABSOLUTELY.
- BUT I NEED MORE FISH
FROM YOU ONSTAGE.
I FELT LIKE IT WAS BOY.
- [OBNOXIOUSLY] OKAY.
- YOU ARE FILLED
WITH ENERGY, ARE YOU?
- YES, GO ON.
- THANK YOU, LAGANJA.
ALL RIGHT, KELLY MANTLE.
- IS THAT BACON ON YOUR CHEST?
- [LAUGHS]
- WHAT IS IT?
- THEY'RE FLOWER PETALS.
- I'M STILL GETTING BACON.
- I THINK I WAS FOCUSING MORE
ON THE HIGH-FASHION PART OF IT.
- BECAUSE NOTHING SAYS HIGH
FASHION LIKE WHITE POLYESTER.
THAT SKIRT IS HORRIBLE.
- HORRIBLE?
- HORRIBLE.
- SAY WHAT YOU WILL
ABOUT THE MATERIALS,
BUT I THINK IT'S VERY FEMININE,
AND I LIKE THAT.
- ADORE DELANO,
TELL ME ABOUT THIS OUTFIT.
- WELL, UM...
I HAD A VISION.
LIKE, IF I WAS
AN EIGHTIES MERMAID
WHO GOT HER PROM DONE BY,
LIKE, HEATHERETTE
WHEN HE FIRST STARTED,
DIDN'T HAVE A SEWING MACHINE.
- [LAUGHING]
- JUST LEARNING HOW TO MAKE
SOMETHING OUT OF SOMETHING.
[LAUGHTER]
- I THINK YOU
ARE SO FREAKING CUTE.
- OH, THANK YOU.
- BUT IT'S PRETTY MUCH FABRIC
WRAPPED AROUND YOUR BODY
WITH A BELT.
- I'M NOT LOVING THIS OUTFIT.
THE EXECUTION OF THE WHOLE THING
IS NOT THERE.
- YOU KNOW, YOU WANT TO TAKE
THAT ONE LAST LOOK IN THE MIRROR
BEFORE YOU HIT THE RUNWAY.
- ALL RIGHT, NEXT UP, VIVACIOUS.
- I CAN ALWAYS TELL WHEN
A NEW YORKER WALKS THE RUNWAY,
BECAUSE WE HAVE
THAT KIND OF BALL WALK,
THAT PEPPER LABEIJA KIND OF...
- OKAY.
- YES, HONEY.
- I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S LIKE THIS WEIRD
COMBINATION OF CAROL CHANNING
MEETS EDGAR ALLAN POE.
[LAUGHTER]
- OH, OKAY.
- YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T WANT
TO COMBINE THOSE TWO.
YOU JUST DON'T.
- THE WORST PART
OF YOUR LOOK IS THE HEMLINE.
IT'S JUST LIKE
YOU RAN OUT OF FABRIC.
- NEXT UP, BENDELACREME.
- DID YOU SEW THIS?
- I DIDN'T.
THIS IS ALL JUST
HOT GLUE AND DESPERATION
FROM HEAD TO TOE.
I WANTED THE CRAFTSMANSHIP TO GO
WITH THE GOLDEN GIRLS THEME
AND LOOK LIKE IT WAS MADE
BY OLD ARTHRITIC HANDS.
[LAUGHTER]
- IT'S COUTURE.
IT'S A CONCEPT.
IT'S STUNNING.
- ALL RIGHT, DELA,
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
NOW, WHILE YOU UNTUCK
IN THE FORM DECOR LOUNGE,
THE JUDGES AND I
WILL DELIBERATE.
JUST BETWEEN US--
WE'RE ALL FRIENDS--
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
LET'S START WITH GIA GUNN.
- I WASN'T THOROUGHLY IMPRESSED
BY THE ENSEMBLE
SHE PUT TOGETHER.
- I'M NOT TRYING TO BE SHADY,
BUT I DIDN'T REALLY LIKE HER
WHEN SHE WAS TALKING.
- YOU KNOW, HER ANSWER
TO EVERYTHING WAS,
"OH, ABSOLUTELY," YOU KNOW,
BEFORE WE EVEN FINISHED
THE COMMENT.
- BUT SHE WAS ABLE
TO WORK THE GARMENT.
- LET'S TALK
ABOUT APRIL CARRION.
- I THINK SHE'S BEAUTIFUL.
THE FACE, THE BODY,
AND ALSO THE OUTFIT
I THOUGHT WAS REALLY
HIGH-FASHION.
- SHE HAMMERED THIS CHALLENGE.
- FOR ME, I'VE NEVER BEEN
A FAN WHEN DRAG QUEENS
USE THEIR OWN HAIR, AND,
IF THEY DO USE THEIR OWN HAIR,
IT CAN'T HAVE
A MAN'S BUZZ CUT BACK THERE.
- I KIND OF THOUGHT
IT WAS KIND OF HOT.
- BECAUSE YOU WANT TO FUCK HER.
- [LAUGHING]
- NEXT UP, LAGANJA ESTRANJA.
- THE THING AROUND HER HEAD
AND THEN THIS ELIZABETHAN COLLAR
AND THEN THAT SCHMATTA...
ON THE BOTTOM, IT WAS JUST...
[IMITATES DEJECTED TONE]
- I LIKED THAT IT WAS ODD.
THERE WERE CERTAIN PROPORTIONS
SHE WAS MAKING WITH HER HAIR
GOING INTO THAT COLLAR.
- BUT I THINK SHE'S JUST
TRYING TOO HARD.
WITH HER PERSONALITY,
"UH-HUH, MAMA,"
YOU KNOW, AND, LIKE,
ALL OF THAT, IT'S JUST ANNOYING.
- RIGHT. YOU KNOW,
WHEN I SEE OLD FOOTAGE OF ME
FROM AROUND THAT AGE,
I'M TRYING SO HARD.
I WISH I COULD SIT MYSELF DOWN
AND GO, "JUST BE YOURSELF."
ALL RIGHT, LET'S MOVE ON
TO KELLY MANTLE.
- ORDINARILY EVERYTHING
IS BETTER WRAPPED IN BACON,
BUT NOT KELLY.
[LAUGHTER]
- FROM TOP TO BOTTOM,
IT WAS OFF.
THAT WAS A SHAKE-AND-GO WIG.
THE MAKEUP WAS TERRIBLE.
- SHE WAS VERY LACKLUSTER,
BUT, DESPITE THAT FACT,
I DO FEEL LIKE
THERE'S SOMETHING UNDERNEATH.
- I AGREE.
YOU KNOW, SHE'S INTELLIGENT,
SHE'S FUNNY,
AND SHE'S A SEASONED QUEEN.
NEXT UP, ADORE DELANO.
NOW, HER OUTFIT WAS HIDEOUS.
- I THINK SHE'S GOT
THAT "IT" THING
THAT NOT ALL THESE GIRLS HAVE.
- SHE IS CHARMING,
AND SHE UNDERSTANDS
HOW TO DELIVER A JOKE.
- BUT IT WAS JUST A MESS.
- ALL RIGHT, NEXT UP, VIVACIOUS.
- GIRL, I THINK THE HAIRLINE
STARTED DOWN HERE.
[LAUGHTER]
- WELL, SHE REPRESENTS
THAT REALLY UNDERGROUND
CLUB STORYLINE.
WAS SHE ABLE TO TRANSLATE THAT
INTO HER CHALLENGE?
- NO, I DON'T GET THAT AT ALL,
BUT THAT WALK WAS EVERYTHING.
- I WAS FASCINATED
BY HER CHARACTER,
AND I WANT TO SEE
WHAT SHE HAS IN STORE.
- ALL RIGHT, NEXT UP,
BENDELACREME.
- I WAS SO IMPRESSED
WITH WHAT SHE GLUED TOGETHER.
- I MEAN, THAT WAS
SNATCHED ON HER BODY.
IT WAS SO FITTED
ON HER HIPS AND HER WAIST.
- IT WAS LIKE A COUTURE GOWN.
- IT REALLY WAS.
YOU KNOW, SHE HAS
THIS CHARACTER THAT SHE DOES.
- SHE KIND OF HAS
A FIFTIES "I LOVE LUCY"
COMEDIC KIND OF VIBE.
- THAT PERSONALITY
CAN GET OLD REAL QUICK.
- SILENCE.
I'VE MADE MY DECISION.
BRING BACK MY SQUIRRELS.
- [CLICKS TONGUE]
- [LAUGHING]
[LAUGHING]
WELCOME BACK, LADIES.
I'VE MADE SOME DECISIONS.
FIRST,
I WILL NOT BE GRANTING
IMMUNITY THIS SEASON.
PERIOD.
MAKE EVERY MOMENT COUNT.
GIA GUNN...
YOU'RE SAFE.
- [MOUTHS] THANK YOU.
- LAGANJA ESTRANJA...
YOU'RE SAFE.
- THANK YOU.
- APRIL CARRION...
YOU'RE SAFE.
BENDELACREME...
YOU WERE SERVING CHEESECAKE
AND LEFT US GAGGING FOR MORE.
CONDRAGULATIONS,
YOU'RE THE WINNER
OF THIS WEEK'S CHALLENGE.
- YES.
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.
- YOU'LL RECEIVE
A CUSTOM JEWEL PACKAGE
FROM FIERCE DRAG JEWELS.
- [CHEERING]
- KELLY MANTLE...
YOUR RUNWAY LOOK...
WAS A LITTLE DOWNTON SHABBY.
I'M SORRY, BUT YOU'RE UP
FOR ELIMINATION.
ADORE DELANO, YOUR COUTURE
WAS A HONEY OF A BOO BOO.
VIVACIOUS,
YOUR RUNWAY STRUT
WAS PURE VOGUE,
BUT YOUR OUTFIT WAS VAGUE.
VIVACIOUS...
I'M SORRY, MY DEAR,
BUT YOU ARE UP FOR ELIMINATION.
ADORE, YOU'RE SAFE.
- THANK YOU.
- YOU MAY JOIN THE OTHER GIRLS.
TWO QUEENS STAND BEFORE ME.
LADIES, THIS IS
YOUR LAST CHANCE TO IMPRESS ME
AND SAVE YOURSELF
FROM ELIMINATION.
THE TIME HAS COME
FOR YOU TO LIP-SYNC
FOR YOUR LIFE.
- I AM NOT GOING HOME.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT KELLY HAS,
BUT I KNOW ONE THING:
I KNOW HOW TO EAT A STAGE.
- GOOD LUCK,
AND DON'T FUCK IT UP.
- KELLY IS SERVING FACE,
SERVING LIP-SYNCHING,
BUT THEN VIVACIOUS,
SHE'S, LIKE, STRUTTING LIKE--
AND I'M FEELING THAT.
I'M BELIEVING. I'M BELIEVING.
- VIVACIOUS IS SOCKING IT.
I WOULD'VE THOUGHT EXPRESS
YOURSELF IS UP KELLY'S AVENUE
OR MORE TO HER AGE GROUP.
- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
- LADIES, I'VE MADE MY DECISION.
VIVACIOUS, SHANTE, YOU STAY.
- THANK YOU, RU.
- YOU MAY JOIN THE OTHER GIRLS.
KELLY MANTLE,
I AM SO GLAD
WE HAD THIS TIME TOGETHER.
NOW, SASHAY AWAY.
- [LAUGHS]
- UNFORTUNATELY, I DIDN'T GET
TO STICK AROUND TO SING OR ACT,
BUT I'M NOT A SEWER.
I HAVE LITTLE SWEATSHOPS IN VAN
NUYS THAT DOES THAT FOR ME.
DON'T WEAR BACON,
DON'T WEAR BACON.
- LADIES, CONDRAGULATIONS
FOR MAKING IT THROUGH
MY FIRST BIG OPENING.
NEXT WEEK, 7 NEW QUEENS
ARRIVE TO COMPETE
FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME,
AND THE WEEK AFTER THAT,
YOUR TWO GROUPS WILL MERGE.
AND THEN, CHILD,
IT'S GONNA GET
SEVERE UP IN HERE.
[ALL TALKING AT ONCE]
- NOW, REMEMBER,
IF YOU CAN'T LOVE YOURSELF,
HOW IN THE HELL YOU
GONNA LOVE SOMEBODY ELSE?
CAN I GET AN AMEN UP IN HERE?
- AMEN!
- ALL RIGHT,
NOW LET THE MUSIC PLAY.
- YEAH!
- BYE!

HEY, PORK CHOP!
HEY, GIRL!
NOW, ARE YOU ALL READY
FOR THIS REUNION TO SET ON FIRE?
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
GOOD,
BECAUSE I HAVE ONE THING TO SAY.
GENTLEMEN, START YOUR ENGINES,
AND MAY THE BEST WOMAN...
WAIT. WAIT, WAIT A MINUTE,
WAIT A MINUTE.
THIS IS THE OSCARS OF DRAG,
SO BEFORE WE START,
I WANT TO TAKE A SELFIE.
OKAY? ALL RIGHT?
SO, GIRLS,
GATHER AROUND, GIRLS.
COME ON, GATHER AROUND.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
ALL RIGHT, SO...
WHO HAS THE LONGEST ARMS?
MILK? MILK...
OKAY, SO LET'S DO THIS THING.
YOU HAVE THE CAMERA?
GIVE US A "1, 2, 3,"
GIVE US A "1, 2, 3."
READY?
1, 2, 3.
GREAT.
[LAUGHS]
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
NOW, MILK, BEFORE YOU POST THIS
TO MY TWITTER ACCOUNT, @RUPAUL,
MAKE SURE YOU PUT ON
THAT SEASON ONE FILTER.
YOU KNOW THE ONE?
[LAUGHTER]
YOU KNOW, WHERE I'M ALL
BLURRY AND SHIT?
YES, YES.
ALL RIGHT,
ALL TOGETHER NOW.
GENTLEMEN...
- START YOUR ENGINES,
AND MAY THE BEST WOMAN WIN!
- [LAUGHS]
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- COMING UP, OUR QUEENS
READ THIS SEASON FOR FILTH,
AND THE TOP 3
GET CROSS-EXAMINED, OOH,
AS WE PREPARE TO CROWN
AMERICA'S NEXT DRAG SUPERSTAR.
DON'T GO AWAY,
"RUPAUL'S DRAG RACE REUNITED"
IS ABOUT TO POP OFF.
- [LAUGHS]
- [LAUGHS]
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
WELCOME BACK TO
"RUPAUL'S DRAG RACE REUNITED."
YOU KNOW, I'VE JUST
BEEN INFORMED
THAT OUR SELFIE HAS BEEN
RETWEETED SO MANY TIMES,
IT DIDN'T JUST BREAK TWITTER,
IT TURNED IT GAY.
[LAUGHTER]
SORRY ABOUT IT.
[LAUGHS]
TONIGHT, ALL THE QUEENS ARE BACK
TO HELP ME CROWN
AMERICA'S NEXT DRAG SUPERSTAR.
FIRST UP,
TWO DRAG DAUGHTERS
THAT POPPED OUT
OF MY TWO BIG OPENINGS.
[LAUGHTER]
A FUNNY QUEEN WHO COULD
BRING HOME THE BACON
BUT COULDN'T QUITE
FRY IT UP IN A PAN,
AND A QUIRKY QUEEN
WITH A NOSE FOR TROUBLE.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.
- YOU ALL READY
TO ROCK AND ROLL?
WHOO!
I AM AN ACTOR.
I'VE BEEN ON A BUNCH
OF TELEVISION SHOWS.
I HAVE BEEN IN DRAG
FOR 17 YEARS.
- IS THAT BACON ON YOUR CHEST?
- [LAUGHS]
- THEY'RE FLOWER PETALS.
- I'M STILL GETTING BACON.
- SASHAY AWAY.
- DON'T WEAR BACON.
DON'T WEAR BACON.
- MAGNOLIA CRAWFORD.
- I VIEW MYSELF AS THE WORLD'S
MOST GLAMOROUS TRASH QUEEN.
THAT'S UGLY.
AWFUL.
I GOT A BUNCH OF SHIT.
- MY EYES HONED RIGHT IN
ON THAT NOSE CONTOUR.
IT IS SO DARK, GIRL.
- I'M NOT CHANGING THIS NOSE
FOR NO MOTHERFUCKING
MICHELLE "V-I-SAGE."
[LAUGHTER]
- KELLY MANTLE
AND MAGNOLIA CRAWFORD!
SO, KELLY, FANS PREDICTED THAT
YOU WOULD BE A FRONT-RUNNER,
BUT YOU ENDED UP
BEING THE FIRST TO LEAVE.
WHAT HAPPENED?
- WELL, I CAN'T SEW,
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.
[LAUGHS]
- WELL, THAT'S A BIG ONE.
I MEAN, BUT YOU KNEW THAT IT WAS
GOING BE A SEWING COMPETITION.
- I KNOW, AND I KNOW
THAT I TOLD YOU
I TOOK COSTUME CONSTRUCTION
IN COLLEGE,
BUT I FAILED TO MENTION
I MADE AN "F."
[LAUGHS]
I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.
- SO WHAT SURPRISED YOU
THE MOST?
- YOU KNOW,
WHAT SURPRISED ME THE MOST
WAS THAT THE JUDGES
WEREN'T HUNGRY FOR MY BACON.
[LAUGHTER]
- I MEAN, WHAT, IS EVERYONE
A VEGAN NOWADAYS IN L.A.?
JEEZ.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- NOW, MAGNOLIA CRAWFORD.
NOW, A LOT OF PEOPLE
THREW YOU SHADE
ABOUT YOUR NOSE CONTOURING.
THIS IS YOUR CHANCE
TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT.
- WELL, YOU KNOW,
I WAS A LITTLE TAKEN ABACK
THAT MY NOSE
WAS SO CONTROVERSIAL.
I GUESS, AT THE END OF THE DAY,
I NOW CAN CALL MYSELF
"MAG-NOSE-LIA."
[LAUGHTER]
SO, THERE YOU GO.
- SO, MAGNOLIA,
WHICH OF THE CHALLENGES
WOULD YOU HAVE KILLED?
- WELL, I ACTUALLY...
I DID NOT WATCH THIS SEASON.
- EX-SQUEEZE-ME?
[LAUGHTER]
- NOW, HOLD ON, HOLD ON.
IN MY DEFENSE, IN MY MIND,
I HAD A VERY GOOD EXPERIENCE,
AND DESPITE THE WAY
ANYTHING CAME ACROSS,
I HAD A FANTASTIC TIME,
AND I JUST WANTED TO REMEMBER IT
AS MY EXPERIENCE.
- HUH.
- YOU KNOW, IT WAS VERY SPECIAL
TO ME, AND I WANTED
TO REMEMBER THAT.
- THAT...I AM NOT BUYING THAT.
YOU DIDN'T WATCH...
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
- YOU CAN READ ME LIKE A BOOK.
[LAUGHS]
- I'M JUST NOT--
KELLY, I MEAN, COME ON,
TALK TO HER,
BECAUSE I AM OVER IT,
OFFICIALLY, OKAY?
[LAUGHTER]
[APPLAUSE]
- OFFICIALLY.
HONEY, LISTEN,
I HAVE ALL THE EPISODES
ON MY DVR, OKAY?
SO YOU COME OVER
SOME MORNING...
- WELL, AREN'T THEY ONLINE?
- WE'LL BRING PORK CHOP,
I'LL BRING THE BACON.
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
- THANK YOU, LADIES.
NEXT UP, THE MOTHER
OF ALL CLUB KIDS,
AND A STUNNING QUEEN
WHO MADE IT RAIN ON THE RUNWAY.
- MOTHER HAS ARRIVED.
MY LOOK IS LEIGH BOWERY
ABSTRACT ENTITY.
VIVACIOUS IS LIVING ART.
- DO YOU HAVE A NAME FOR
THE HEAD ON TOP OF YOUR HEAD?
- ORNACIA.
- ORNACIA, OKAY.
- I CAN ALWAYS TELL WHEN
A NEW YORKER WALKS THE RUNWAY.
- OKAY?
- YES, HONEY.
- REPORTING FOR DUTY.
APRIL CARRION IS IN THE HOUSE.
- YEAH!
- APRIL IS A CROSS BETWEEN
BJORK AND COCO ROCHA.
YOU KNOW, SOMETHING WEIRD,
BUT SOMETHING GLAMOROUS.
- I THINK SHE'S BEAUTIFUL.
THE FACE, THE BODY.
- I CAN SEE ADAM LAMBERT
WATCHING THESE THIGHS.
HE WANTS SOME CHICKEN LEG.
- YOU ARE GORGEOUS!
- YOU'RE GORGEOUS AS WELL.
- AW, THANK YOU.
- GET A ROOM.
[LAUGHTER]
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- VIVACIOUS, FIRST OF ALL,
HOW IS ORNACIA?
- YOU KNOW, ORNACIA, SHE SWEARS
SHE'S HER OWN PERSON NOW,
AND MISS THING
HAD THE NERVE THE OTHER DAY
TO SEND ME A WRIT
OF EMANCIPATION.
[LAUGHTER]
- NOW, YOU WERE HERE
REPRESENTING THE CLUB CULTURE,
AND YOUR WALK WAS EVERYTHING.
- YES, MAMA.
- YES.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- YOU KNOW, OLD SCHOOL WAY
IS THE OLD SCHOOL WAY, HONEY.
WE'RE GOING TO WALK AND GIVE YOU
HIPS FOR YOUR NERVE.
WE'RE GOING TO SISSY IT,
AND "SHASSAY" AND SHANTAY HER
RIGHT DOWN THE RUNWAY, HONEY.
- ALL RIGHT, APRIL CARRION.
NOW, YOU'VE BEEN TWEETING
OUTFITS YOU WOULD HAVE WORN
HAD YOU STAYED ON THE SHOW.
- YES.
- AND THEY LOOK AMAZING.
- WELL, THIS IS
MY SNATCH GAME.
I WAS GOING TO DO
KIM KARDASHIAN IN THE MET GALA.
SHE WAS PREGNANT.
[LAUGHTER]
- OH, NICE, NICE.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- THIS IS
MY BLACK AND WHITE LOOK.
IT'S INSPIRED BY "BEETLEJUICE."
I BET MICHELLE WILL CLOCK ME
WITH MY HAIR, BUT WHATEVER.
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
- RIGHT?
BECAUSE IT'S CUTE, RIGHT?
IT'S FUN, IT'S FUN.
- YEAH. OH!
UH-OH, UH-OH, UH-OH,
WAIT A MINUTE.
HOLD UP, NOW,
BITCH STOLE MY LOOK.
[LAUGHTER]
- YES.
THIS IS MY RU LOOK,
AND I LOVE IT.
IT'S LIKE A CLASSIC RU LOOK.
THAT'S WHAT I THINK OF YOU.
- I LOVE IT.
SO, OVERALL, IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU WOULD HAVE DONE DIFFERENTLY
IN THE COMPETITION?
- NO, LIKE, FOR REAL,
I'M REALLY HAPPY
WITH THE OUTCOME,
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW WHAT? I WASN'T
MEANT TO WIN THIS SEASON.
I'M MEANT TO WIN ALL STARS 2.
- [LAUGHS]
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- ONE LAST THING,
AS WE GO TO BREAK.
VIVACIOUS, WILL YOU TEACH THESE
CHILDREN HOW TO WALK THAT WALK?
- YES, HONEY,
IT WOULD BE A PLEASURE.
- ALL RIGHT, GO ON,
LET'S SEE IT.
[DANCE MUSIC]
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- BACKSTAGE,
IN THE OVERSTOCK.COM RED ROOM,
OUR TOP 3 NERVOUSLY WAIT
TO FIND OUT
WHO WILL BE CROWNED
AMERICA'S NEXT DRAG SUPERSTAR.
- COMING UP,
GIA GUNN FIRES OFF,
MILK SPILLS THE "T,"
AND MUCH MORE, AS "RUPAUL'S
DRAG RACE REUNITED" CONTINUES.
[CHEERING]
- [LAUGHS]
- [LAUGHS]
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
WELCOME BACK TO "RUPAUL'S
DRAG RACE REUNITED."
WE ARE JUST MOMENTS AWAY
FROM FINDING OUT
WHO WILL BE CROWNED AMERICA'S
NEXT DRAG SUPERSTAR.
BUT FIRST, IT'S TIME
TO RECONNECT WITH TWO QUEENS
WHO LEFT US GAGGING
WHEN THEY SASHAYED AWAY.
TAKE A LOOK.
- MY NAME IS GIA GUNN.
GIA IS A FISHY GIRL.
SHE IS C.C.C.,
CRAZY CUCKOO CUNT.
I'M FEELING MY OATS,
LET ME FEEL MY OATS.
- I COULD TELL
THAT YOU'RE THE FEISTY ONE.
- ABSOLUTELY.
- I'M MILK.
I'M 25 YEARS OLD.
MILK IS A VERY CONCEPTUAL
PERFORMER.
I KNOW I'M NOT GOING TO FIT IN
WITH THOSE GLAMOROUS QUEENS,
AND SO WHY NOT STAND OUT?
- BITCH, ANYBODY
THAT COMES DOWN THE RUNWAY
LOOKING LIKE THAT,
I WANT TO GET INTO YOUR BRAIN.
SO, WHAT'S GOING ON?
- [LAUGHS]
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- G-G-G-GIA.
ARE YOU HAPPY TO BE HERE?
- ABSOLUTELY.
- [LAUGHS]
NOW, GIA, I LOVE
YOUR SENSE OF HUMOR,
BUT SOME PEOPLE
TOOK YOU VERY SERIOUSLY.
- YOU KNOW WHAT, I DO UNDERSTAND
THAT MAYBE SOME THINGS
COULD HAVE BEEN TAKEN
A LITTLE BIT THE WRONG WAY.
I JUST FELT LIKE I WAS TELLING
THE TRUTH, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
[LAUGHTER]
SINCE THEN, YOU HAVE ALLOWED ME
TO EXPAND MY HORIZON
AND BE ABLE TO VALIDATE QUEENS
LIKE MILK, JUST LIKE MYSELF.
[APPLAUSE]
- I LOVE IT.
NOW, WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE
PEOPLE TO KNOW ABOUT GIA GUNN
THAT THEY DON'T?
- YOU KNOW WHAT, HONESTLY?
THAT I'M REALLY JUST A HUMBLE,
REALLY NICE ASIAN GIRL
THAT JUST...
[LAUGHTER]
IS HERE JUST
TO TURN THE PARTY, SO...
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- SO, MILK,
HOW HAS YOUR LIFE CHANGED?
- WHEN I WAS KICKED OFF
THE SHOW, I...
THANKS A LOT.
- [LAUGHS]
YOU WEREN'T KICKED OFF THE SHOW!
[LAUGHTER]
- YOU BOOTED ME IN THE BUTT.
- BUT YOU ENJOYED IT,
DIDN'T YOU?
- I SURE DID.
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
- I'VE QUIT MY BOY JOB,
AND AT THE END OF MAY
I AM GOING TO LIFE BALL,
A HUGE AIDS BENEFIT,
AND I'M SO EXCITED.
IT'S JUST A PARTY.
- THAT'S LOVELY.
AND YOU GOT A LOT OF ATTENTION
AS A BOY ON THE SHOW.
- HMM?
- WERE YOU SURPRISED BY THAT?
- REALLY? WHAT? REALLY?
- WHOO! WHOO!
- WELL, I GUESS I NEVER REALIZED
HOW HORNY "DRAG RACE" FANS ARE.
[LAUGHTER]
WELL, LIKE, BOTH MEN AND WOMEN
ALIKE TELL ME HOW HOT I AM
AND HOW MUCH THEY WANT
TO SLEEP WITH ME.
- RIGHT, RIGHT.
OH, SO IS THAT
HOW YOU QUIT YOUR JOB,
BECAUSE YOU'RE MAKING
ALL THESE COINS...
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
NEXT UP,
A QUEEN THAT CAME UNCORKED,
AND ANOTHER WHO HAD
A SECRET STASH OF DRAMA, MAMA.
- COME ON, SEASON 6,
LET'S GET SICKENING!
LAGANJA IS KNOWN FOR HER WILD
AND AMAZING DANCE ABILITIES.
COME ON, NATCH!
- YOU DO THIS "OKAY, OKAY."
- I DO TALK LIKE THAT,
AND I'M SORRY YOU--
- NO, NO, YOU TALK LIKE THIS!
THIS IS HOW YOU TALK!
- I AM TRINITY K. BONET.
- GORGEOUS.
- I'M ABOUT AS CLOSE AS
YOU'RE GOING TO GET TO BEYONCE.
NOW, IF I FUCK UP, IT'S BECAUSE
THIS IS NOT MY FORTE.
- I KNOW THAT THERE'S A BLOCK
THERE FOR YOU TO UNLOCK.
- STOP RUNNING
AROUND MY HOUSE LIKE THAT,
YOU'RE GOING TO RUN
MY LIGHT BILL UP.
[LAUGHTER]
- YOU HAVE OVERCOME
YOUR SABOTEUR,
AND I'M SO PROUD TO SEE IT.
I'M SO PROUD TO SEE IT.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- LAGANJA ESTRANJA,
HOW ARE YOU, MAMA?
- WELL, MAMA,
I'M DOING VERY GOOD.
- OKAY.
- OKAY.
- WELL, YOU WERE CALLED OUT
BY THE JUDGES
AND THE OTHER GIRLS
FOR BEING FAKE.
DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT?
- WELL, NO, GIRL,
I HONESTLY JUST THINK
YOU ALL WERE BORING, AND I WAS
TRYING TO TURN THE PARTY.
YES, GONE!
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- NOW, DID YOU FEEL ANY PRESSURE
TO LIVE UP TO YOUR DRAG MOTHER,
ALYSSA EDWARDS?
- WELL, YES.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
OF COURSE I FELT PRESSURE.
BUT I'M SO THANKFUL THAT I HAVE
SUCH A BEAUTIFUL PERSON
AND SOMEONE SO LOVING
TO MENTOR ME,
AND I REALLY LOVE YOU.
[APPLAUSE]
- SO, WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING
SINCE THE SHOW?
- WELL, YOU KNOW,
I HIT THE GROUND RUNNING
THE MINUTE I GOT ELIMINATED.
I GOT A SONG OUT, A MUSIC VIDEO,
A JEWELRY LINE, A MAKEUP LINE,
AND I'M ABOUT TO GO TO BRAZIL
FOR THE WORLD CUP, BABY.
- BUT, LAGANJA,
YOU'RE LEAVING SOMETHING OUT.
MY GUESS IS THAT YOU STOPPED BY
THAT WEED DEALER FIRST.
- OH, HONEY, YOU WONDER
WHY I'M CALM TONIGHT?
SHE'S MEDICATED.
AAH...
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
- LEGALLY, YES.
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
WELL, THANK YOU, LAGANJA.
- THANK YOU, MAMA RU.
- NOW, TRINITY K. BONET.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
YES.
YOUR TRANSFORMATION MADE ME CRY,
WHICH IS REALLY HARD TO DO,
GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF BOTOX
I HAVE IN MY FACE.
[LAUGHTER]
EARLY IN THE COMPETITION,
YOU WERE SHUT DOWN.
WHAT CHANGED FOR YOU?
- IN PARTICULAR, BIANCA.
WHEN WE DID THE COMMERCIAL,
IT WAS SOMETHING
ABOUT HER ENERGY
SITTING AT THAT TABLE, WRITING.
I NEVER GOT THAT CLOSE TO HER
IN THE COMPETITION,
AND THEN IT WAS LIKE,
"PIECE OF CAKE, LET'S DO THIS."
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- NOW, WHAT PART OF THE SHOW
WERE YOU THE MOST PROUD OF?
- BEING BRAVE,
AND TELLING MY STORY,
AND BEING ABLE TO BE
A VOICE FOR PEOPLE
WHO DIDN'T FEEL
LIKE THEY HAD A VOICE.
I CAN BE WHO THE HELL
I WANT TO BE,
AND NOBODY CAN QUESTION ME
FOR IT, BECAUSE THIS IS MY LIFE.
- RIGHT, RIGHT, I LOVE IT.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- NOW, I KNOW YOUR DREAM
IS TO BECOME A BEYONCE
IMPERSONATOR, TRINITY,
BUT I THINK YOU SHOULD
JUST KEEP ON BEING YOU,
BECAUSE I LOVE YOU, TRINITY.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
NOW, FROM BEARDED LADIES
TO MERMAIDS,
FROM CLUB KIDS
TO PAGEANT QUEENS,
THIS SEASON,
THE DIFFERENT STYLES OF DRAG
RAISED A LOT OF QUESTIONS.
SO WE PUT TOGETHER A LITTLE
"HERSTORY" LESSON.
LEARN IT AND LEARN IT WELL.
WHAT IS DRAG?
DRAG IS UNDERGROUND
AND OVER-THE-TOP.
DRAG IS POLITICAL
AND POLITICALLY INCORRECT.
DRAG IS CAMP
AND COUTURE.
DRAG IS PUNK
AND MAINSTREAM.
DRAG IS A LAUGH RIOT,
AND IT COULD START A REVOLUTION.
DRAG IS NEVER HAVING TO SAY
YOU'RE SORRY,
BECAUSE DRAG IS ALL ABOUT BEING
WHOEVER THE HELL YOU WANT TO BE.
- AND DRAG BRINGS
PEOPLE TOGETHER.
NOW, REACH OUT
AND TOUCH A DRAG QUEEN'S HAND.
MAKE THIS WORLD
A BETTER PLACE IF YOU CAN.
- AND THE MOST IMPORTANT
THING OF ALL,
DRAG NEVER, EVER
TAKES ITSELF TOO SERIOUSLY.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- [LAUGHS]
- BACKSTAGE,
IN THE OVERSTOCK.COM RED ROOM,
OUR TOP 3 QUEENS
ARE FEELING THE DRAG UNITY.
- AW.
- COMING UP, WE'LL KEEP IT FOXY.
BENDELACREME AND DARIENNE LAKE
BREAK IT DOWN,
AND OUR QUEENS
ANSWER FAN QUESTIONS,
AS "RUPAUL'S DRAG RACE REUNITED"
KEEPS ON KEEPING ON.
- [LAUGHS]
- [LAUGHS]
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- WELCOME BACK
TO THE THEATER AT ACE HOTEL
AND "RUPAUL'S DRAG RACE
REUNITED."
NOW, THESE NEXT 3 QUEENS
MAY NOT HAVE TAKEN HOME
THE CROWN,
BUT THEY SURE SNATCHED
PLENTY OF ATTENTION.
THE FIRST ARRIVED WITH OPTIMISM,
A WINNING SPIRIT,
AND ONE HOT BODY-ODY-ODY.
- WHOO!
- JOSLYN FOX IS ALL ABOUT
THE LOOK AND SHOWING BODY.
JOSLYN FOX IS ONE FOXY LADY.
WA-WA.
- BAM!
- WHAT?
- THAT ASS IS SO PERFECT.
- WELL, HONEY, JUST BECAUSE
NOBODY IS INTERESTED
IN YOUR STYLE,
BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE IT CAME
FROM THE FUCKING
QUINCEANERA STORE.
- LIKE, I KNOW
I'VE OVER-ACCESSORIZED.
THEY CAN LOVE IT OR SHOVE IT.
- HEY, MY LOVE,
IT'S YOUR FIANCE.
- OH, MY GOD!
- YOU'RE MY ROCK,
AND I SUPPORT YOU 100%.
YOU KNOW I LOVE YOUR GUTS.
- AW.
- I PLAN ON BEING THE BLACK
HORSE IN THIS COMPETITION.
- [SPEAKING ENGLISH]
- OH, IT IS DARK HORSE,
ISN'T IT?
- HELLO, JOSLYN FOX.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- HI, RU, HOW ARE YOU?
[LAUGHS]
- SO, I WANT TO KNOW
HOW YOUR FAMILY REACTED
TO YOU SHOWING ALL THAT ASS.
- OOH, I THINK
THEY'RE USED TO IT.
[LAUGHTER]
- THEY'VE SEEN IT BEFORE,
IT WAS NOTHING NEW.
[LAUGHS]
- HAS THE JUDGES' CRITIQUES
CHANGED YOUR DRAG?
- VERY MUCH SO.
I WEAR MORE ACCESSORIES.
- [LAUGHS]
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
SO, WHAT ADVICE
DO YOU HAVE FOR QUEENS
WHO HAVE AUDITIONED
YEAR AFTER YEAR, LIKE YOU DID?
- YOU KNOW, THIS WAS
MY FOURTH TIME AUDITIONING,
AND I THINK THE FIRST FEW TIMES
I WAS MAKING A STRONG EFFORT
TO GIVE YOU
WHAT I THOUGHT YOU WANTED,
AND IT WASN'T UNTIL THIS
AUDITION THAT I JUST SAID,
"YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M JUST GOING TO BE ME."
SO MY ADVICE IS TO ALWAYS
STAY TRUE TO WHO YOU ARE,
BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN YOUR SHINING
PERSONALITY WILL COME THROUGH.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
AND WHEN ALL ELSE FAILS,
KEEP IT FOXY.
WA-WA.
[LAUGHS]
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- WELL, WA-WA.
THANK YOU, JOSLYN.
[LAUGHS]
- THANK YOU, RU-ZIE-Q.
- UP NEXT, A BURLESQUE BABE
AND A GORGEOUS GAL
WITH PLUS-SIZED TALENTS.
LET'S WATCH.
- BENDELACREME IS EFFERVESCENT
AND OPTIMISTIC.
I REFER TO HER
AS "TERMINALLY DELIGHTFUL."
OOH!
- BENDELACREME VISAGE.
- BITCH STOLE YOUR LOOK!
- [LAUGHS]
I FEEL LIKE EVERY TIME, WE'RE
HIDING BEHIND ANOTHER COSTUME.
- I UNDERSTOOD VIRTUALLY
NONE OF THE WORDS
THAT LEFT YOUR LIPS MOMENTS AGO.
- [LAUGHS]
- I REALLY FEEL
SOME PSYCHIC ENERGY
BETWEEN DELA AND DARIENNE.
- YOU REMIND ME
OF A RUSSIAN DOLL.
FULL OF YOURSELF.
[LAUGHTER]
- SO, DARIENNE,
HOW DO YOU CHOOSE YOUR GROUP?
- IT'S NONE
OF YOUR FUCKING BUSINESS.
[ALL GASP]
- DIP INTO THE WATERS
OF DARIENNE LAKE.
- I WAS PICKED FAN FAVORITE
ON THE ONLINE FACEBOOK CONTEST.
- SHE'S A FIERCE LIP-SYNCER,
ALL ABOUT SELLING FACE.
- YOUR MOTHER
DARNS SOCKS IN HELL! HA HA!
- YOU WERE THROWN OUT OF
THE HOUSE AS A KID, WEREN'T YOU?
- IT WAS MORE LIKE
AN INVITATION TO LEAVE.
THERE WAS A LOT OF YEARS
OF NOT LOVING MYSELF.
- HMM.
- AND I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT,
"WELL, IF YOU CAN'T
LOVE YOURSELF,
FEEL FREE TO HATE
AS MANY PEOPLE AS YOU WANT TO."
- [LAUGHS]
- YOU KNOW?
[CHUCKLES]
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- WELCOME, DELA.
NOW, DELA,
WHEN YOU SASHAYED AWAY,
PEOPLE FREAKED THE FUCK OUT.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- I THOUGHT IT WAS KIND OF
WEIRD, TOO, NO OFFENSE, AND...
[LAUGHTER]
NOW, HOW HAVE FANS REACTED
TO DELA'S PERPETUALLY
PERKY ATTITUDE?
- IT'S BEEN AMAZING.
I FEEL LIKE I'VE BEEN PUTTING
THIS KIND OF POSITIVITY
INTO THE WORLD,
THAT'S, YOU KNOW,
MAYBE A LITTLE
OVER-THE-TOP AT TIMES.
AND WHAT'S HAPPENED
IS THAT I'VE HAD
SO MANY AMAZING CONVERSATIONS
WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE FED
THAT ENERGY BACK TO ME,
AND SAID THAT IT SOMEHOW
HELPS TO LIFT THEM UP,
AND IT'S MADE BEN
A HAPPIER PERSON AS WELL.
- OH, I LOVE THAT.
THAT'S GREAT.
THAT'S GREAT.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
SO, WHAT SURPRISED YOU THE MOST
ABOUT DOING THE SHOW?
- IT IS AN ACTUAL RACE.
I DON'T THINK AT HOME
YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW FAST WE'RE ACTUALLY
DOING THINGS,
BUT YOU'RE, LIKE,
STUMBLING OUT TO THE RUNWAY
AND STRAPPING YOUR SHOE
AND GLUING ON YOUR EYELASH,
AND THEN THEY'RE LIKE, "TELL US
ABOUT WHEN YOUR MOM DIED,"
AND IT'S ROUGH.
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
- IT'S TRUE. IT'S TRUE.
YEAH.
SO, DARIENNE,
LET'S GET STRAIGHT TO IT.
WHAT WERE
YOUR DIFFERENCES WITH DELA?
- YOU KNOW,
IT WAS JUST ONE OF THOSE THINGS.
IT'S LIKE, YOU KNOW,
SHE SNAPPED, I SNAPPED.
WE KIND OF HAD A MOMENT,
AND THEN, YOU KNOW...
[LAUGHTER]
YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT ABOUT
ALWAYS HAVING GREAT TIMES,
IT'S ABOUT HAVING THOSE TIMES
THAT YOU NEED
TO STRUGGLE THROUGH,
SO I FEEL SO MUCH CLOSER TO HER.
- YEAH.
I FEEL LIKE IT'S ALL WATER
UNDER A DUCK'S BACK,
OR WHATEVER THE PHRASE IS.
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
DARIENNE, I DID
ACTUALLY WANT TO BRING
A LITTLE PEACE OFFERING.
YOU ONCE SAID THAT I WAS
LIKE A RUSSIAN DOLL,
AND SO HERE'S YOUR VERY OWN
DELA RUSSIAN DOLL.
- OH, MY GOD,
THERE'S MORE GOODNESS INSIDE!
- YES.
- IS THERE CANDY IN THERE?
[LAUGHTER]
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I HAVE SOMETHING FOR YOU, TOO.
AN APOLOGY,
I'LL GIVE IT TO YOU.
THANK YOU FOR BEING
SUCH A GOOD FRIEND, YOU KNOW?
AND GIVING ME MY REALITY CHECK.
AND I APOLOGIZE
FOR ANY STRESS I CAUSED YOU.
[APPLAUSE]
- AW.
I LOVE THAT, I LOVE THAT.
NOW, DARIENNE,
YOU CONFIDED IN ME
THAT YOU'D HAD A BAD
FALLING-OUT WITH YOUR PARENTS,
AND, AS I'VE SAID,
WE GET TO CHOOSE OUR FAMILIES,
BUT SOMETIMES,
IF YOU'RE REALLY LUCKY,
"DRAG RACE" CAN BRING
FAMILIES TOGETHER.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.
- HI, DARIENNE, IT'S MOM.
WE WISH WE COULD BE THERE
WITH YOU TODAY,
BUT WE WANT YOU TO KNOW WE DID
WATCH A FEW OF THE EPISODES,
AND I'M PROUD OF YOU.
WE KNOW HOW TOUGH
IT WAS FOR YOU TO COME OUT,
AND TELL US WHO YOU ARE,
AND HOW YOU FEEL,
AND I JUST WANT YOU
TO KNOW THAT WE LOVE YOU,
AND THAT WE SUPPORT YOU,
AND WE NOW ARE COMING OUT
AS DARIENNE'S PARENTS.
I'M HOPING THAT
WE CAN MAKE THIS MAYBE BE
THE FIRST DAY
OF THE REST OF OUR LIVES.
- HEY, DARIENNE, YOUR MOM
REALLY LIKED THE EARRINGS
YOU HAD ON THE OTHER NIGHT,
SO, GUESS WHAT?
I WENT OUT
AND BOUGHT HER A PAIR.
[LAUGHTER]
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?
WE'RE PROUD OF YOU, SON.
- WE LOVE YOU, DARIENNE.
- AW!
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- SO, DARIENNE, HOW DO YOU FEEL?
- I NEVER,
IN A MILLION YEARS,
THOUGHT THAT WOULD EVER HAPPEN,
AND WE'VE BEEN THROUGH A LOT,
AND I LOVE YOU, GUYS, YOU KNOW?
SO...BRAVO.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- IN THE OVERSTOCK.COM RED ROOM,
OUR TOP 3 QUEENS ARE DOING
A LITTLE SISTERLY BONDING
BEFORE THEY TAKE THE STAGE.
COMING UP, WE REVEAL
THIS YEAR'S MISS CONGENIALITY,
AND AN EXTRA SPECIAL SURPRISE,
ALL WHEN "RUPAUL'S
DRAG RACE REUNITED" RETURNS.
- [LAUGHS]
- [LAUGHS]
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- ONCE UPON A TIME,
THERE WERE 3 LITTLE QUEENS
WHO WENT
TO "RUPAUL'S DRAG RACE,"
EACH WITH A CHARISMA,
UNIQUENESS, NERVE,
AND TALENT OF THEIR OWN,
AND THEY LOVED TO SHOW IT OFF.
WELCOME BACK THE TOP 3!
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
I CAN'T FUCKING SING,
BUT I'M IN THE MOTHERFUCKING
TOP 3, MOTHERFUCKERS!
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- ADORE, BIANCA, AND COURTNEY,
YOUR PUSSIES ARE ON FIRE!
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
BUT IT'S TIME
FOR SOME PROBING FAN QUESTIONS.
FIRST, THE NUMBER ONE
QUESTION ONLINE IS,
WHAT'S THE STATUS OF LAGANJA
AND ADORE'S RELATIONSHIP?
- OOH.
- YOU TWO ARRIVED AS FRIENDS,
BUT YOU HAD THIS HUGE BLOW-UP,
SO WE BROUGHT YOU BACK TOGETHER
TO WATCH THAT MOMENT
BEFORE IT AIRED.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.
- HI.
- AND THIS GIRL.
- [LAUGHS]
HOW ARE YOU?
- GOOD. HOW ARE YOU?
- OH, GOOD.
THIS IS GOING TO BE
REALLY INTERESTING.
- A LITTLE BIT, YEAH.
- I'M SCARED.
- LET'S DO IT,
LET'S ROLL THE TAPE.
- THIS RIGHT NOW,
THAT'S THE BITCH THAT I KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW "YES, MAMA."
- WHEN I'M WITH MY BEST FRIENDS
I SAY, "YES, MAMA."
- THAT AIN'T HOW YOU TALK
WHEN I HANG OUT WITH YOU
WHEN THE CAMERAS AREN'T HERE.
- NOW I AM ANNOYING, I AM FAKE,
I'M NOT WHO I'M BEING...
- HOLD UP. HOLD UP, BITCH.
- I'M PRETENDING TO BE
SOMEBODY I'M NOT...
- NO, THAT'S WHAT I DID NOT
WANT TO MAKE IT, GANJA.
- WELL, HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO FEEL IN THIS MOMENT?
- GANJA, I DIDN'T
WANT TO MAKE IT
THAT EVERYBODY
WAS ATTACKING YOU.
- YEAH, I FEEL VERY ATTACKED!
- I DIDN'T MEAN IT TO COME OFF
LIKE HOW IT CAME OFF,
BUT I WAS JUST, LIKE,
REALLY FRUSTRATED.
LIKE, YOU PUT THAT ON
TO DO SOMETHING
FOR, LIKE, A CHARACTER
OR SOMETHING.
I'VE NEVER IN MY LIFE
HEARD YOU TALK LIKE THAT,
IN MY LIFE.
- I WAS JUST TRYING TO BE FUNNY.
- BUT THEN YOU'RE SAYING
THAT THAT'S YOU.
- YOU CAN SAY
THAT ALL THIS IS FAKE,
BUT THIS IS REAL, BITCH.
- I DON'T KNOW, I'M STILL
STICKING BY TO WHAT I'M SAYING.
I DIDN'T FEEL
LIKE THAT WAS GENUINE.
LIKE, I DIDN'T WANT THIS TO TURN
INTO A BULLYING LAGANJA THING,
BECAUSE I FUCKING
FELT BAD FOR YOU,
AND I STILL HAVE YOUR BACK,
EVEN THOUGH I HEAR THINGS.
- I FEEL LIKE
THERE'S THINGS THAT...
AHH, YOU'VE HEARD
BECAUSE I'M FUCKING JEALOUS.
- LIKE...
- I DON'T WANT
TO LOSE MY FRIEND.
- I FEEL LIKE THIS NEEDS TO BE
A CONVERSATION, LIKE,
IN PRIVATE.
- SO, ADORE, DID YOU TWO END UP
HAVING A PRIVATE CONVERSATION?
- THERE IS A CUTE, LITTLE BAR
ACROSS THE STREET,
SO WE GOT A COUPLE
OF DRINKS, AND...
[LAUGHS]
WE ACTUALLY TALKED IT OUT,
AND I DID REALLY HAVE
A STRONG CONNECTION WITH LAGANJA
BEFORE COMING
INTO THIS COMPETITION,
SO WE'RE AT A GOOD PLACE
RIGHT NOW, WE REALLY ARE.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- SO, LAGANJA, DO YOU THINK
THE FRIENDSHIP IS MENDED?
- ABSOLUTELY.
RELATIONSHIPS GO THROUGH
TOUGH TIMES, AND WE'VE MOVED ON,
AND, YOU KNOW,
I LOVE ADORE WITH ALL MY HEART.
THAT'S MY SISTER,
AND I LOVE HER.
- RIGHT ON. RIGHT ON.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
THANK YOU, LADIES.
LET'S TAKE SOME FAN QUESTIONS
FROM THE AUDIENCE.
OH, OH, OKAY. HEY.
[LAUGHTER]
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- [LAUGHS]
I LOVE IT.
OKAY, THIS IS A FAN OF FACEBOOK
QUESTION FOR ADORE
FROM MIGUEL TORRES.
"I KIND OF GET THE FEELING
THAT YOU HAVE A CRUSH
"ON BIANCA DEL RIO
WHEN SHE'S NOT IN DRAG.
DO YOU?"
- UM...
[LAUGHTER]
IF I HAD A CRUSH ON BIANCA,
I WOULD HAVE TRIED
TO COP A FEEL, BUT I DIDN'T.
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
- I WOULD NEVER SLEEP WITH HER,
BECAUSE I ONLY GIVE TO CHARITY
ONCE A YEAR, ALL RIGHT?
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
- ALL RIGHT,
WE HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION
FROM A YOUNG LADY IN YELLOW.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- HIEEEE.
- HIEEEE.
- I HAVE A FACEBOOK QUESTION...
[LAUGHTER]
FROM TEAL FLEMMING,
FOR GIA GUNN.
- [LAUGHS]
- "WHAT WAS WITH
THAT EYELASH, GIRL?"
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
- YOU KNOW,
TO BE COMPLETELY HONEST,
I DO HAVE ONE EYE
THAT IS SMALLER
AND BIGGER THAN THE OTHER,
BECAUSE I DO HAVE
VERY ASIAN-ESQUE EYES,
AND HOPEFULLY
IT'S A LOT BETTER TONIGHT.
[APPLAUSE]
- ABSOLUTELY.
- ABSOLUTELY.
- HEY!
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- YES!
- [LAUGHS]
- OKAY.
HERE'S ONE FOR BIANCA
FROM NINA FORLINI,
AND SHE SAYS,
"HONESTLY, I JUST WANT
BIANCA TO READ ME,
AND SINCE SHE'S NOT HERE,
WHY DON'T..."
OH, "WHY DON'T YOU
JUST READ ME?"
OH, SHIT.
[LAUGHTER]
- WAIT, NOW, YOU KNOW
GOOD AND WELL, JIGGLY,
THAT WE ARE VERY,
VERY GOOD FRIENDS.
I COULDN'T POSSIBLY DO IT,
BUT I'M GOING TO TRY, BITCH.
- [GROANS]
- YOU ARE FROM SEASON 4,
THE SEASON OF TEETH.
THAT WAS YOU, IT WAS
THAT LITTLE SNAGGLETOOTH
THAT CAME OUT AND SAID,
"HEY, I WANT TO BE
PART OF THE SHOW!"
[LAUGHTER]
OH, BITCHES, FUCK YOU,
IF WE WERE IN A BAR,
YOU WOULD BE LAUGHING
AT THIS BULLSHIT RIGHT NOW.
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
DO WE HAVE ANY MORE QUESTIONS?
- HELLO, I'M ANDRE,
FROM WORCESTER, MASSACHUSETTS,
JOSLYN'S FIANCE.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
JOSLYN, YOU KNOW,
I ASKED YOU 3 YEARS AGO
IF YOU WOULD MARRY ME, AND YOU
SAID THAT YOU WERE WAITING
TILL YOU GOT
ON "RUPAUL'S DRAG RACE"
UNTIL WE COULD GET MARRIED,
SO, YOU FINALLY MADE IT,
AND I WAS WONDERING
IF WE COULD GET MARRIED
RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- YOU ARE IN LUCK, ANDRE!
COME ON DOWN, BECAUSE MAMA RU
IS AN ORDAINED MINISTER.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
THAT'S RIGHT!
I TELL YOU WHAT,
YOU STAND HERE.
I'M ALSO A WEDDING PLANNER.
YOU STAND THERE,
AND YOU STAND HERE.
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE US
A WEDDING, YOU ALL.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
OH, SCRUFF PIT CREW!
[WAGNER'S BRIDAL CHORUS PLAYS]
- [LAUGHS]
WELL, WELL, WELL.
THE MOTHERS OF THE BRIDE
AND GROOM ARE HERE.
SUSANNE AND DEBORAH.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
OKAY, HERE WE GO.
WE ARE GATHERED HERE TONIGHT
TO CELEBRATE
A CRAZY LITTLE
THING CALLED LOVE.
JOSLYN AND ANDRE,
DO YOU PROMISE
TO CHERISH, HONOR,
AND RESPECT EACH OTHER
AS LONG AS YOU BOTH SHALL LIVE?
- I DO.
- I DO.
- WHAT LOVE
HAS BROUGHT TOGETHER,
LET NO MAN PUT ASUNDER.
I NOW PRONOUNCE YOU MARRIED!
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- ANDRE, YOU MAY KISS THE BRIDE.
WA-WA.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
[WAGNER'S BRIDAL CHORUS
CONTINUES]
- NOW, SASHAY THAT BOUQUET.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- COMING UP,
MISS CONGENIALITY IS REVEALED,
AND WHO DO YOU WANT TO BE
AMERICA'S NEXT DRAG SUPERSTAR?
ARE YOU TEAM ADORE,
TEAM BIANCA, OR TEAM COURTNEY?
KEEP TWEETING, AS "RUPAUL'S
DRAG RACE REUNITED" CONTINUES.
- [LAUGHS]
- [LAUGHS]
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
WELCOME BACK TO "RUPAUL'S
DRAG RACE REUNITED."
NOW, AS YOU KNOW,
WINNING THE TITLE
OF AMERICA'S NEXT DRAG SUPERSTAR
IS WORTH $100,000.
BUT WINNING THE HEARTS
OF FANS IS PRICELESS.
TO ANNOUNCE WHICH ONE
OF THESE BITCHES
YOU VOTED TO BE
MISS CONGENIALITY,
PLEASE WELCOME
LAST YEAR'S WINNER,
I LOVE SAYING THIS,
IVY WINTERS!
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- THE FANS HAVE SPOKEN.
- REALLY? WHAT HAVE THEY SAID?
- OH, MY GOD.
[LAUGHTER]
THE WINNER OF SEASON 6
MISS CONGENIALITY
AND A $2,500 GIFT CARD
FROM OVERSTOCK.COM IS...
BENDELACREME!
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- CONDRAGULATIONS, IS THERE
ANYTHING YOU'D LIKE TO SAY?
- IT HAS MEANT
SO MUCH FOR SOMEBODY
WHO IS A SHY PERSON,
WHO DOESN'T ALWAYS FEEL
LIKE THEY WANT TO REVEAL
THEMSELVES TO EVERYBODY,
TO BUILD SOMETHING
TO HELP THEM DO THAT,
PUT IT IN THE WORLD,
AND HAVE IT RECEIVED SO WELL.
THANK YOU, GUYS, SO MUCH.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- AND THANKS TO ALL
THE FANS FOR VOTING.
NOW, WHEN IT COMES
TO THIS SEASON'S TOP 3,
IT'S AS SIMPLE AS A, B, C.
"A" IS FOR ADORE DELANO.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- MY NAME IS ADORE DELANO,
AND I'M A FUCKING LIBRA.
FOR ALL THE QUEENS TELLING ME
THAT I'M NOT POLISHED ENOUGH,
I JUST WANT THEM TO KNOW
THAT I'M POLISH REMOVER, BITCH.
PARTY!
- YOU'RE RELYING A LOT
ON YOUR CHARM AND PERSONALITY,
WHICH CONCERNS ME.
- I CAME HERE TO BE, LIKE,
TOP 3, AND TO FUCKING WIN IT.
- YOU HAVE TO LEARN
TO APPLY YOUR GREAT THINGS,
LIKE IN THE RAPPING
OR THE SINGING,
INTO THE OTHER CHALLENGES.
- SHE'S A PERFORMER.
ADORE IS DEFINITELY A SUPERSTAR.
HER VOICE MADE ME LOOK AT HER
IN A WHOLE ANOTHER LIGHT.
- BECAUSE WHOEVER SAID BEAUTY
WAS ON THE INSIDE...
- IS UGLY.
- YOU MADE ME SO HAPPY TONIGHT,
I COULD KISS YOU!
- OH, MY GOD,
ARE WE GOING TO DO TONGUE?
[LAUGHTER]
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- ALL SEASON LONG
YOU WERE FULL OF SELF-DOUBT.
THEN DURING THE GLITTER BALL
YOU HAD AN EPIPHANY.
- YES.
- WHAT HAPPENED?
- IT WAS DEFINITELY
THE TALK THAT YOU GAVE ME.
IT CHANGED MY LIFE, REALLY,
AND I APPLIED THAT
TO MY DAILY LIFE
AS WELL AS MY DRAG CAREER.
IT WAS REALLY AN EYE-OPENER.
NO ONE HAS, LIKE,
EVER, LIKE, SAT ME DOWN
AND ACTUALLY PUT IT INTO WORDS
AND HAD IT MAKE SENSE,
AND I JUST, LIKE,
AM FOREVER GRATEFUL FOR THAT.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
I ALREADY FEEL LIKE A WINNER.
WELL, I STILL WANT TO WIN
REALLY BAD...
[LAUGHTER]
BUT, LIKE, REALLY BAD.
I REALLY FEEL LIKE
A FULLY DEVELOPED CHARACTER
BECAUSE OF YOU
AND BECAUSE OF THE SHOW.
I FEEL MORE LOVE FOR MYSELF
THAN I'VE EVER FELT,
AND I NEVER THOUGHT THAT
THAT WOULD HAPPEN.
YOU GAVE ME THAT,
AND YOU MADE ME REALIZE THAT
WITH JUST PUTTING IT
REALLY SIMPLE.
- YEAH, YEAH, WELL,
WHAT WOULD YOU DO DIFFERENTLY
HAVING SEEN THE SHOW?
- IN THE BEGINNING,
I THINK I REMEMBER EVEN TELLING
YOU THIS IN THE WORKROOM,
I WENT IN AND I WAS LIKE,
"HMM, I'LL PROBABLY MAKE IT
THIRD EPISODE," AND THEN...
[LAUGHTER]
WELL, BECAUSE I STARTED SEEING
ALL THE GIRLS' SHIT,
AND I WAS LIKE,
"OH, FUCK," AND THEN...
[LAUGHTER]
YEAH.
YEAH, MAN, AND THEN I'VE SEEN
GIA'S STUFF, AND SHE'S LIKE,
"HOW ABOUT HER, THOUGH?
WELL, HOW IS SHE?"
AND I WAS JUST LIKE, "OH."
[LAUGHTER]
LIKE, I STARTED APPLYING MYSELF
TO THE CHALLENGES MORE.
I REALLY FELT CRAZY, I WAS
LOOKING AT MYSELF IN THE MIRROR,
AND I WAS LIKE,
"YOU GOT THIS."
LIKE, "YOU ARE GOING TO SLAY
THIS SHIT, NO MATTER WHAT."
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- SO, I WANT TO KNOW
WHAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING
SINCE WE STOPPED FILMING.
- I JUST FINISHED MY ALBUM.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
I'M REALLY EXCITED
ABOUT THAT, YEAH.
- GREAT.
SO, ADORE, IF YOU WON
THE CROWN AND THE $100,000,
WHAT WOULD YOU DO?
- I WOULD TRY MY HARDEST
TO BREAK THROUGH MAINSTREAM
AND CARRY ON YOUR LEGACY,
I THINK IT'S TIME.
I MEAN, LADY GAGA IS DOING IT.
THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
HER AND I IS I HAVE A PENIS,
AND THAT'S QUESTIONABLE,
AND I JUST...
[LAUGHTER]
MY THING IS, LIKE,
I FEEL LIKE I HAVE
WHAT IT TAKES TO BECOME
THAT CRAZY DRAG SUPERSTAR,
POP STAR, TOUR THE WORLD,
INSPIRE KIDS AROUND THE WORLD,
AND I THINK WINNING
THE CROWN WOULD HELP ME
REALLY PUT MY STAMP ON THAT.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- NOW, I KNOW YOUR MOM, BONNIE,
IS YOUR BEST FRIEND.
- YES, SHE IS.
- LET'S SAY HELLO.
- HI, MOM!
- OH, HEY, BONNIE!
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- WHO IS SHE HERE WITH?
- SHE'S HERE WITH JERRY,
HER BOYFRIEND,
WHO'S ALSO A FAN OF THE SHOW,
AND HE LIKES BIANCA.
HE'S PROBABLY
JUST HERE TO WATCH HER.
[LAUGHTER]
HE THINKS SHE'S SO FUCKING COOL.
LIKE, I THINK IT'S, LIKE,
THE HUMOR THAT IS LIKE...
IT'S ODD, THEY HAVE THE KIND
OF THE SAME HUMOR.
I THINK THAT'S WHY
I LOOK AT HER AS A DAD.
NO, I'M JUST KIDDING.
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
- YOU GOT ME, BITCH!
YOU GOT ME, BITCH.
- SO, BONNIE, IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU'D LIKE TO SAY TO ADORE?
- JUST KEEP DOING
WHAT YOU'RE DOING,
AND WE'RE VERY PROUD OF YOU.
I LOVE YOU VERY MUCH,
AND I MISS YOU.
- I MISS YOU, TOO.
I HAVEN'T SEEN HER IN, LIKE,
IN 2 1/2 WEEKS.
- OH, REALLY?
- YEAH.
- OH, YOU'VE BEEN ON THE ROAD.
- HMM, MAKING THAT MONEY,
MONEY, MONEY, MONEY,
MONEY, MONEY, MONEY.
- HEY!
WELL, THANK YOU, MISS DELANO,
I ADORE YOU.
- THANK YOU.
- I THINK I SPEAK FOR ALL
"DRAG RACE" FANS EVERYWHERE
WHEN I SAY, "PARTY."
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- NEXT, BIANCA AND COURTNEY
LET US HAVE IT,
AND WE'RE THIS CLOSE TO CROWNING
AMERICA'S NEXT DRAG SUPERSTAR.
- [LAUGHS]
- [LAUGHS]
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- WELCOME BACK TO "RUPAUL'S
DRAG RACE REUNITED."
"B" CAN STAND FOR MANY THINGS.
BEAUTIFUL, BALLSY, BOSSY,
OR JUST BIANCA DEL RIO.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- MY NAME IS BIANCA DEL RIO.
I AM AN INSULT COMIC,
JUST LIKE DON RICKLES,
BUT IN A DRESS.
YOU LOOK LIKE A DAMN ROLL
OF SCOTCH TAPE.
- [LAUGHS]
- YOU KNOW EXACTLY
HOW TO LAND A JOKE.
- MY MOTHER INSISTED
THAT WE STAY TRUE
TO OUR SPANISH HERITAGE,
SO MY FIRST WORDS WERE...
[KNOCKS]
"HOUSEKEEPING."
[LAUGHTER]
- I THINK THE DEL RIOS
NAILED IT.
- BALONEY!
- BIANCA IS SECRETLY ADORABLE.
- DON'T TELL ANYBODY
THAT I'M BEING KIND.
- SHE'S THE TYPE OF PERSON WHERE
YOU, LIKE, WANT TO HUG HER,
AND SHE'S JUST LIKE,
"UGH, GET AWAY."
LIKE, IT'S VERY THAT.
- I HAD A GUARD.
I HAVE BUILT UP THIS WALL,
AND THIS EXPERIENCE
HAS CHANGED ME.
I WENT THROUGH A SELF-DISCOVERY,
ACCEPTING THAT I'M NOT
SUCH A BAD BITCH.
- THANK YOU, BIANCA.
- THANKS, RU,
YOU SHADY BITCH.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- NOW, BIANCA,
ARE WE SUPPOSED TO BELIEVE
THAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY
A NICE PERSON?
- [CHUCKLES]
NO, IT'S ALL IN THE EDITING.
IT'S ALL EDITING.
- [LAUGHS]
- WHAT I DO ON STAGE,
AND WHAT I'VE DONE
FOR A LONG TIME HAS BEEN
A BITCH OR AN INSULT COMIC
OR SOMEONE TO BE AFRAID OF,
BUT, YOU KNOW,
IN MY EVERYDAY LIFE, YOU KNOW,
I CAN'T GO TO RITE AID AND SAY,
"FUCK YOU, BITCH,
GIVE ME MY SHIT."
[LAUGHTER]
- NOW, AND YOU'RE
A SEASONED QUEEN.
WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG
TO AUDITION FOR THE SHOW?
- WELL, I REALLY DIDN'T,
YOU KNOW,
SEE ANYBODY THAT WAS LIKE ME.
I THOUGHT THERE WAS
A CERTAIN TYPE.
I THOUGHT IT WAS ALWAYS
FOR YOUNGER GIRLS
THAT KNEW BEYONCE MEDLEYS.
AND I WAS FRIENDS
WITH LADY BUNNY,
WHO GAVE ME SOME
GOOD ADVICE, AND SHE SAID,
"GIRL, TRY IT!
YOU NEVER KNOW!"
[LAUGHTER]
AND WHEN I TOLD HER
I WAS LEAVING TO DO THE SHOW,
SHE GOES, "THIS IS YOUR CHANCE
TO ELECTRIFY THE NATION.
SEE YOU IN A WEEK
WHEN YOU'RE ELIMINATED."
SO...
[LAUGHTER]
- SO, HOW HAS "DRAG RACE"
CHANGED YOUR LIFE?
- FOR SOMEBODY LIKE ME,
WHO HAS WORKED IN THIS BUSINESS
FOR 18 YEARS,
IS GIVEN THIS OPPORTUNITY,
THIS PLATFORM,
HAS BEEN PHENOMENAL.
TO TRAVEL THE COUNTRY AND GET
TO MEET ALL THESE PEOPLE,
AND THE FACT THAT I'M NOW A PART
OF IT IS PRETTY FUCKING CRAZY.
- IT IS, IT IS.
- IT'S INSANE.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- YOU ARE A QUEEN
WHO SPEAKS HER MIND.
WAS IT HARD FOR YOU TO WATCH?
- YEAH, SOMETIMES.
I HAD THOSE MOMENTS
WHEN I WOULD CRINGE,
AND YOU'RE JUST LIKE,
"OH, SHIT."
YOU KNOW, LIKE,
"I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID THAT,"
BUT I THINK THAT
IN THAT SITUATION, YOU KNOW,
IT BRINGS OUT THE GOOD
AND BAD IN EVERYBODY.
- SO, WHAT WOULD IT MEAN TO YOU
TO BECOME AMERICA'S
NEXT DRAG SUPERSTAR?
- WELL, IT WOULD MEAN
THAT I BEAT THESE OTHER BITCHES.
NO.
[LAUGHTER]
I THINK IT'D BE AMAZING,
I MEAN, I'M IN GREAT COMPANY.
AND I'VE REALIZED THAT I DON'T
HAVE TO BE A LIP-SYNC ARTIST,
I DON'T HAVE TO BE A DANCER,
I DON'T HAVE TO BE A SINGER,
I CAN BE ME, WHICH IS A FOOL,
AND DO IT ON THAT LEVEL.
[APPLAUSE]
- SO, WHO'S HERE
SUPPORTING YOU TONIGHT?
- MY GOOD LITTLE FRIEND LOLA
IS HERE TONIGHT.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- SO, LOLA, IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU'D LIKE TO SAY TO ROY LADY?
- LASHES AND LIPSTICKS
AND HIPS THAT KILL,
RUPAUL, YOU SURE HAVE
SOME BIG HEELS TO FILL.
BUT I KNOW BIANCA,
I'M HER NUMBER ONE FAN.
IF YOU CROWN HER OUR QUEEN,
I WON'T TELL SHE'S A MAN.
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
- BIANCA, WE KNEW YOU WERE
A HARD AND HILARIOUS BITCH,
BUT IT'S REWARDING TO FIND OUT
THAT YOU'RE A NICE ONE, TOO.
I PROMISE I WON'T TELL ANYONE.
YES.
- THANK YOU.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- NOW, IT'S TIME TO FINISH
OUR LESSON IN THE ABCs OF DRAG,
AND I THINK WE ALL KNOW
WHAT THE C-WORD IS.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- COURTNEY ACT, A PROVEN STAR
ACCUSED OF RESTING ON PRETTY,
AS IN PRETTY FUCKING AMAZING.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.
- IS THIS AMERICA'S
NEXT TOP MODEL?
MY NAME IS COURTNEY ACT.
I GUESS MY REPUTATION COULD
INTIMIDATE THE OTHER QUEENS.
I'M A SINGER.
- OH.
- YOU ARE A STAR.
- I HONESTLY WANT
TO JUST SKIN YOU ALIVE
AND WEAR YOUR BODY.
- [LAUGHS]
- YOUR BODY IS PHENOMENAL.
- COURTNEY KNOWS HOW TO DO SEXY.
SHE'S A NATURAL.
- IS THAT ALL YOU'VE GOT?
- [GRUNTS]
- I'M GETTING, DARE I SAY,
BORED WITH THIS PRETTY THING.
- SHE DOES RELY ON THAT,
BUT THAT'S WHO SHE IS.
SHE IS BEAUTIFUL.
- COURTNEY ACT
IS AN IMMENSE TALENT
WHO HAS CONSISTENTLY BROUGHT
AMAZING LOOKS TO THE RUNWAY.
- I AM ONE DEGREE OF SEPARATION
FROM CHER!
- I AM SECURE ENOUGH
IN MY HETEROSEXUALITY
TO SAY "WOW."
- [LAUGHS]
[APPLAUSE]
- HAS BEING IN THIS COMPETITION
ADDED PRESSURE?
BECAUSE YOU WERE ALREADY
A STAR DOWN UNDER.
- COMING INTO THIS COMPETITION,
THERE WAS SUCH HIGH EXPECTATION,
AND IT DID ADD
A LOT OF PRESSURE.
I LEARNT SO MUCH ABOUT MYSELF
GOING THROUGH THIS COMPETITION.
- LIKE WHAT?
- AUSTRALIANS DO HAVE
A VERY BLUNT,
KIND OF HONEST SENSE OF HUMOR,
AND THERE WAS A LOT OF TIMES
WHERE I THOUGHT
THAT I WAS BEING HELPFUL,
AND I WATCH IT BACK,
AND I'M LIKE,
"OOH, DID SHE JUST SAY THAT?"
- [LAUGHS]
- SO I'M DEFINITELY
LEARNING TO CHIP AWAY
THAT SORT OF COLD
AUSTRALIAN EXTERIOR.
- SO, WHAT WOULD IT MEAN TO YOU
TO BECOME AMERICA'S
NEXT DRAG SUPERSTAR?
- I MOVED FROM AUSTRALIA
3 YEARS AGO.
I MOVED FROM A FANTASTIC LIFE
INTO, LIKE,
A SHOEBOX APARTMENT
IN WEST HOLLYWOOD,
EARNING LESS MONEY
I DID WHEN I WAS 18,
AND IT WAS A STRUGGLE, BUT EVERY
MOMENT OF IT I WAS SO EXCITED,
BECAUSE I GOT TO BE HERE
LIVING MY DREAM.
AND IN JUST 3 YEARS
I'M SITTING ON THIS STAGE
AS ONE OF THE TOP 3
IN "RUPAUL'S DRAG RACE."
JUST HAVING THAT DREAM
VALIDATED, IT IS OTHERWORLDLY.
SO I THANK YOU,
AND I THANK YOU,
AND I THANK YOU ALL
FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY.
- YES. YES.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
WELL, I KNOW THAT YOU ARE
A LONG WAY FROM AUSTRALIA,
BUT DO YOU HAVE ANY
FRIENDS AND FAMILY HERE
TO SUPPORT YOU TONIGHT?
- I HAVE GOT A FRIEND HERE
WHO I ACTUALLY MET ON THE SHOW.
MR. CHAZ BONO.
- OH, REALLY?
- YEAH!
- OH, MY GOODNESS!
[LAUGHS]
- HE WAS DOING
A MUSICAL PRODUCTION,
AND HE ASKED
IF I WOULD BE IN IT.
WE GOT TO BECOME FRIENDS.
IT'S JUST KIND OF,
LIKE, BLOSSOMED.
CHAZ CAME TO AUSTRALIA
WITH ME TO--
- REALLY?
- YEAH, TO DO MY SHOW
AT THE SYDNEY
GAY AND LESBIAN MARDI GRAS.
I GOT TO SING "I GOT YOU, BABE"
WITH CHAZ BONO.
- WOW.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
AMAZING, AND...
ARE YOU SURE
YOU'RE JUST FRIENDS?
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE I AM
AN ORDAINED MINISTER.
[LAUGHTER]
- AND I'VE STILL GOT TIME,
I COULD MARRY YOU, GUYS.
- NO, WE'RE GOOD.
- OKAY.
- WE'RE GOOD, WE'RE OKAY.
I MEAN, SHE IS LOOKING
PARTICULARLY LOVELY TONIGHT.
- [LAUGHS]
- BUT WE'RE GOOD, I THINK.
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
- YEAH.
YOU KNOW, MAYBE IF SHE WINS...
I MEAN, I COULD USE
HALF OF $100,000, BUT...
[LAUGHTER]
- I'M GETTING A PRENUP.
- I LOVE IT.
[LAUGHTER]
SO, LET'S GIVE A BIG ROUND
OF APPLAUSE TO OUR FINAL 3,
BECAUSE THE CHILDREN,
THEY DO LIVE FOR THE APPLAUSE,
OKAY?
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
[LAUGHS]
WHEN WE COME BACK,
I'M GOING TO CROWN
AMERICA'S NEXT DRAG SUPERSTAR.
OR AM I? HMM...
- WE ARE SECONDS AWAY
FROM FINDING OUT
WHO WILL BE CROWNED
AMERICA'S NEXT DRAG SUPERSTAR.
WILL IT BE ADORE DELANO,
BIANCA DEL RIO, OR COURTNEY ACT?
ALL WILL BE REVEALED WHEN
"RUPAUL'S DRAG RACE REUNITED"
CONTINUES FROM THE THEATER
AT ACE HOTEL IN DOWNTOWN L.A.
- [LAUGHS]
- [LAUGHS]
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- WELCOME BACK TO "RUPAUL'S
DRAG RACE REUNITED."
ADORE DELANO.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
BIANCA DEL RIO.
COURTNEY ACT.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
ONE OF YOU IS JUST MOMENTS AWAY
FROM BEING CROWNED AMERICA'S
NEXT DRAG SUPERSTAR.
BUT FIRST, JOINING US
FOR HER LAST LAP
AS AMERICA'S
NEXT DRAG SUPERSTAR,
PUT YOUR HANDS TOGETHER
FOR JINKX MONSOON!
[MUSIC]
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- [LAUGHS]
HEY, JINKX, HOW'S TRICKS?
- TRICKS ARE FOR KIDS.
I'M AMERICA'S
NEXT DRAG SUPERSTAR.
- [LAUGHS]
- FOR ABOUT 60 MORE SECONDS.
- YES.
WELL, WELL.
WHAT'S LIFE BEEN LIKE
SINCE YOU SNATCHED THAT CROWN?
- WELL, MOTHER DARLING,
I GOT TO DO MY ORIGINAL SHOW,
"THE VAUDEVILLIANS,"
ALL ACROSS THE WORLD THIS YEAR.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
MY FULL-FEATURE DOCUMENTARY
"DRAG BECOMES HIM"
WILL COME OUT THIS SUMMER,
AND I JUST RELEASED
"THE INEVITABLE ALBUM"
BY JINKX MONSOON.
[CHUCKLES]
AVAILABLE ON iTUNES!
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- [LAUGHS]
SO, JINKXY, DO YOU HAVE
ANY WORDS OF ADVICE
FOR AMERICA'S
NEXT DRAG SUPERSTAR?
- WELL, I HIGHLY SUGGEST
YOU REVEL
IN EVERY SINGLE SECOND OF IT,
MIND YOUR Ps AND Qs,
AND WHEN THE BITCHES
COME FOR YOU,
LET THAT BULLSHIT BE WATER OFF
A MOTHERFUCKING DUCK'S BACK.
- [LAUGHS]
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
WELL, JINKX, YOUR REIGN
MAY BE ENDING TONIGHT,
BUT IT WILL ALWAYS BE
FOREVER MONSOON SEASON.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
WELL, THE WAIT IS OVER, KITTENS.
IN ADDITION TO THE TITLE OF
AMERICA'S NEXT DRAG SUPERSTAR,
TONIGHT'S WINNER
WILL ALSO WALK AWAY
WITH A CROWN AND SCEPTER
PROVIDED BY FIERCE DRAG JEWELS,
A SICKENING SUPPLY
OF COLOREVOLUTION COSMETICS,
AND A CASH PRIZE OF $100,000.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
ALL RIGHT.
THE TIME HAS COME
TO CROWN OUR QUEEN.
AS ALWAYS, I HAVE CONSULTED
WITH THE JUDGES AND THE FANS,
BUT THE FINAL DECISION
IS MINE TO MAKE.
ADORE DELANO.
BIANCA DEL RIO.
COURTNEY ACT.
THE WINNER
OF "RUPAUL'S DRAG RACE,"
AMERICA'S NEXT DRAG SUPERSTAR,
IS...
BIANCA DEL RIO!
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- FUCK YOU, BITCH, I LOVE YOU.
- THANK YOU.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- NOW, IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU'D LIKE TO SAY?
- [CHUCKLES]
THAT IN THE SHOW
I DIDN'T CRY ONCE,
AND THE WEIRD THING NOW,
I'M NOT CRYING,
IT'S MY FUCKING EYELASH,
GIA JINXED ME, BUT...
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]
ON A SERIOUS NOTE,
AS A 30-YEAR-OLD MAN IN A WIG,
NEVER GIVE UP, SOME SHIT
CAN REALLY HAPPEN LATER IN LIFE,
AND I AM THE MOST GRATEFUL GUY
ON THE PLANET,
SO THANK YOU, THANK YOU ALL.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- MY QUEEN, I BOW TO THEE.
NOW, PRANCE, I SAID.
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
- NOW, REMEMBER,
IF YOU CAN'T LOVE YOURSELF,
HOW IN THE HELL ARE YOU
GOING TO LOVE SOMEBODY ELSE?
AND I KNOW I CAN GET
AN AMEN UP IN HERE.
- AMEN!
- ALL RIGHT.
NOW, GO ON HOME,
DO DRAG, EVERYBODY.
- I THOUGHT BIANCA WAS A HOOT,
BUT, RU, YOU'RE STILL
MY FAVORITE.
- BALONEY!


- PREVIOUSLY
ON "RUPAUL'S DRAG RACE."
- WE'RE NOT HAVING
JUST ONE PREMIERE,
WE'RE HAVING TWO.
NEXT WEEK,
7 NEW QUEENS ARRIVE.

YOUR BEST HIGH-FASHION LOOK.
- OH!

[APPLAUSE]

KELLY MANTLE,
SASHAY AWAY.

THAT WE DIDN'T GET ELIMINATED?
- YEAH!
- WORD UP.
- I WAS ABOUT
TO HAVE AN EMOTIONAL BREAKDOWN
ONSTAGE TODAY.

DRAG QUEEN WHO'S EARLY--

- HI, JOSLYN, I'M BIANCA.
- NICE TO MEET YOU, BIANCA.
- NICE TO MEET YOU.
APPARENTLY, JOSLYN WORE
EVERY FUCKING PIECE
OF JEWELRY SHE OWNED.
IT LOOKED LIKE
SHE WENT TO CLAIRE'S BOUTIQUE,
FELL ON A SALE RACK,
AND SAID, "I'LL TAKE IT."
- [GIGGLING]
- THOSE ARE NICE LEGS.
- THANK YOU.

YOU WOULD THINK
SHE WAS IN THE CIRCUS.

MY NAME IS MAGNOLIA CRAWFORD,
I'M 28 YEARS OLD,
AND I AM SEATTLE'S
SEXIEST DRAG QUEEN,
SEATTLE'S FUNNIEST DRAG QUEEN.

I VIEW MYSELF AS THE WORLD'S
MOST GLAMOROUS TRASH QUEEN.

HER CONTOURED NOSE TO DEATH.
OH, WHO ARE YOU POINTING AT?
- NICE TO MEET YOU, BIANCA.

A FUCKING SWORDFISH.
SHE COULD FLIP PAGES
IN A BOOK.
- WHAT INSPIRED YOUR LOOK TODAY?
- WELL I WAS FEELING
KIND OF ANIMAL.
I'VE GOT THE LIONS.

GOING FOR PEG BUNDY.

"AMERICA'S NEXT TOP MODEL"?
OH, SORRY.

I WAS STARSTRUCK.
NICE TO MEET YOU, COURTNEY,
I'M A BIG FAN OF YOURS.
MY NAME'S JOSLYN FOX.
THIS IS LIKE MEETING
A CELEBRITY.
I LOVE COURTNEY.
- I GUESS MY REPUTATION COULD
INTIMIDATE THE OTHER QUEENS.
I'M MOST FAMOUS
FOR BEING A FINALIST
ON THE FIRST SEASON
OF "AUSTRALIAN IDOL."
- SO, WHAT TYPE
OF ENTERTAINER ARE YOU?
- I'M A SINGER.
- OH.
- YEAH.
- LIVE?
- YEAH.
- OH, FUCK YOU.
COURTNEY LOOKS LIKE A GIRL,
VERY PRETTY.
BUT THAT DOESN'T IMPRESS ME.
IT'S NOT DRAG.
[HEELS CLICKING]
- I HEAR A CLYDESDALE.
- THEY BETTER WIDEN
THE DOORWAYS
AND REINFORCE
THE RUNWAY, HONEY,
BECAUSE A BIG GIRL'S
IN THE HOUSE.
I'M DARIENNE LAKE,
I'M 24 YEARS OLD,
AND I'M A COMPULSIVE LIAR.
I WAS PICKED FAN FAVORITE
ON THE ONLINE FACEBOOK CONTEST.
HI, I'M DARIENNE.

[LAUGHTER]
- SOME OF THE QUEENS ARE PRETTY,
I'M PRETTIER.
SOME OF THEM ARE FUNNY,
I'M FUNNIER.
AND SOME OF THEM ARE BIG,
BUT I'M BIGGER.
- HI, I'M MAGNOLIA.
- MAGNOLIA,
JUST A SPRINGTIME FLOWER.
I'M JUST BEGGING
TO BE POLLINATED, MYSELF.
- OH.
- WHAT HAS BEEN GOING ON HERE?
- I HAVE NO IDEA.
- SOMEBODY'S BEEN HERE.
- DID YOU SEE THAT?
- OH. I DON'T GET IT.
[SIREN WAILS]
- OH.
- OOH, GIRL!
YOU'VE GOT SHE-MAIL.
- WHAT?
SHOULDN'T THERE BE MORE CHICKS?
- WELCOME, MY QUEENS.
YOU MIGHT THINK
YOU WERE TARDY FOR THE PARTY,
BUT IT'S NOT
ABOUT WHO COMES FIRST,
IT'S ABOUT
WHO CAN LAST THE LONGEST.
- OH.
- [SQUEAKY VOICE]
NOW, YOU GOT TO FIGHT
FOR YOUR RIGHT TO PARTY!
- [LAUGHTER]
- MY VOICE
IS SO FISHY, RIGHT NOW.

NOW, YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED
THAT YOU'RE NOT
THE FIRST QUEENS TO ARRIVE.
IN FACT, LAST WEEK,
7 QUEENS CAME, COMPETED,
AND ONE HAS ALREADY
SASHAYED AWAY.
- OH.
- NOW, ON THE BRIGHT SIDE,
BY SPLITTING YOU
INTO TWO GROUPS,
YOUR CHANCE TO SNATCH
MY ATTENTION
IS BETTER THAN EVER.
BUT ON THE SHADY SIDE,
THERE'S A ONE IN 7 CHANCE
THAT YOU'LL BE ELIMINATED
BEFORE YOU EVEN MEET
THE OTHER QUEENS.
THE PRESSURE IS ON, LADIES.
ARE YOU READY
FOR YOUR BIG CLOSE-UP?

I'VE ALWAYS SAID "BLACK HORSE."
[GIGGLES]

ARE YOU KIND OF, LIKE,
NATALIE IMBRUGLIA FAMOUS?

I GOT SIGNED TO SONY BMG,
I TOURED AROUND THE COUNTRY,
AND I'VE GONE ON TO HAVE
A REALLY GREAT AND WONDERFUL
CAREER IN AUSTRALIA.

I'M NOT NERVOUS AT ALL
ABOUT GOING UP
AGAINST COURTNEY ACT.
I DON'T SEE A LOT OF,
LIKE, DRAG THERE.
I WAS ON A STEREO SHOP
COMMERCIAL,
BUT IT WAS ONLY LOCAL.
- TELL ME ABOUT THAT.
- WE WERE IN DRAG.
THEY WANTED SOME LOCAL,
LIKE, CELEBRITY-TYPE PEOPLE.

WERE AVAILABLE,
WHICH IS WHY YOU TOOK THE JOB.
- OOH!

- HERE COMES
MAGNOLIA CRAWFORD,
FROM HOEDOWN TO COUTURE.
- HOLSTEIN COUTURE.
- WOULD YOU CALL THAT
A MOO-MOO?
- MILK IT.
[MOOS]
- I FEEL LIKE HOEDOWN
MEETS HIGH SCHOOL PROM IN 1993.
- SHE'S UDDER-LY FANTASTIC.
- WORK IT, HEIFER.
- JOSLYN FOX, QUINCEANERA.
15 GOING ON FABULOUS!
- WHERE THE PARTY AT?
- EVERYWHERE, APPARENTLY.
- [CHUCKLES]
- SANDBAGS.
- I AM SERVING UP FUN,
FLIRTY LIFE-OF-THE-PARTY,
BECAUSE THAT IS JOSLYN FOX.
- TIJUANA?
YES, I DO.
- HA!
- COURTNEY ACT.
- LOOK AT THAT BIG BOX.
[LAUGHS]
- OH, SAY CAN YOU SEE?
- SHE'S A MEMBER
OF THE TEA BAG PARTY.
- [LAUGHS]
- I'M FEELING LIKE A VIXEN.
I'M BARING FLESH, I'VE GOT LEGS,
I'VE GOT BODY-ODY-ODY.
- OH, YES. SHE'S WALKING
THE PARTY LINE, DARLING.
- WORK IT OUT.
- DON'T IT MAKE
YOUR RED STATE BLUE?
MILK!
- FROM TOGA PARTY TO COUTURE.
OH, DEAR.
NOW, I'VE HEARD
OF A MILK MOUSTACHE, BUT--
- HONEY.
- I AM SERVING
HERMAPHRODITE REALNESS.
I AM FEELING "XANADU,"
AND I AM WORKING IT OUT.
- VERY SISTER DIMENSION.
- OR FATHER TIME,
DEPENDING HOW YOU LOOK AT IT.
COMING UP--
- IT WAS JUST A DISASTER.
- I GET THIS ANGRY VIBE
FROM YOU.
- YOU HAVE
TO GET PEOPLE TO LIKE YOU.
[LAUGHS]
- [LAUGHS]
WELCOME, PARTY GIRLS.
IT'S TIME
FOR YOUR FIRST CRITIQUE
FROM THE JUDGES.
FIRST UP,
TRINITY KARDASHIAN BONET.
- HONEY, YOU'RE GIVING ME
SOME KARDASHIAN ASS
IN THAT DRESS.
- OH.
- [LAUGHS]
- I THINK THAT
WOULD'VE BEEN FIERCE
WITHOUT THE BULLETIN BOARD
BEHIND YOUR NECK.
CAN YOU TAKE THAT OFF?
SEE?
LOOK HOW MUCH MORE BEAUTIFUL
THAT LOOKS.
- GORGE.
- THANK YOU, TRINITY.
NEXT UP, BIANCA DEL RIO.
- THAT DRESS IS GORGEOUS.
- YOU DEFINITELY KNOW
HOW TO CONSTRUCT FOR THE BODY.
- NOW, DON'T STEAL THIS
AND TRY MARKETING THIS
AT SEARS, NOW, GIRL.
- OH, HONEY,
IT'S STOLEN, IT'S GONE.
I DO THINK THAT YOUR EYE MAKEUP
IS A LITTLE TOO HEAVY,
BECAUSE I DON'T FEEL LIKE
I COULD SEE YOUR EYES
AS MUCH AS I WOULD LIKE TO.
- IT'S JUST A SOFTENING
OF THE EDGES,
BUT THOSE DIMPLES
ARE EVERYTHING.
- I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU COULD SEE MY ASS.
- [LAUGHTER]
- ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU, BIANCA.
- THANK YOU.
- NEXT UP, DARIENNE LAKE.
- OH, HELLO, DEAR.
- YOUR FACE LOOKS BEAUTIFUL.
THAT'S HOW YOU SOFTEN
THE EDGES, RIGHT THERE.
- IT LOOKS GORGEOUS.
- BUT THAT SAID,
A LITTLE BORING HERE.
- I HAVE A VERY BIG CAMEL TOE.
MY PUSS IS VERY LARGE
AND IN CHARGE--
I'M A BIG GIRL.
I EMBRACE IT, THOUGH,
BUT I CANNOT HAVE RUCHING
IN FRONT OF MY BODY,
BECAUSE IT'S JUST GOING
TO ACCENTUATE MY PUSS.
I WISH YOUR OUTFIT WAS STRONGER.
- NEXT UP, MAGNOLIA CRAWFORD.
- MY EYES HONED RIGHT IN
ON THAT NOSE CONTOUR,
IT IS SO DARK, GIRL.
- AND THAT DRESS,
IT'S VERY BASIC.
IT'S, LIKE, SO--
- I DON'T THINK
THAT THIS PRINT IS BASIC.
- BUT YOU THINK
THIS REPRESENTS YOU?
- YES, BECAUSE I AM ATTRACTED
TO THINGS THAT ARE SO UGLY
THEY'RE FABULOUS.
- YOU'RE NOT GIVING ME THAT.
- I--
- THAT'S NOT UGLY.
- BUT I DIDN'T LIKE MY BOX.
THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH YOU CAN DO
WITH RED AND WHITE CHECK.
- THE THING IS,
YOU COULD'VE DONE MORE.
- I'VE GOT A GODDAMN BOW
ON MY ASS.
- I GET THIS ANGRY VIBE
FROM YOU.
- I--OKAY.
- THIS IS THE MOTHERFUCKING
OLYMPICS, GIRL.
YOU'VE GOT TO BRING IT
EVERY TIME.
AND IF YOU WANT TO BE
IN THIS BUSINESS,
YOU HAVE TO GET PEOPLE
TO LIKE YOU.
WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON.
NEXT UP, JOSLYN FOX.
- HEY, JOSLYN.
- HELLO, YOU SEXY,
SEXY, BALD MAN.
- [LAUGHS]
THE WHOLE OUTFIT
IS JUST OVER THE TOP.
IT WAS LIKE A PARADE FLOAT.
- SHE DIDN'T WEAR ANYTHING
FROM HER BOX,
AND YOU WORE EVERY FRIGGIN'
THING IN YOUR BOX.
YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL.
YOU DON'T NEED ALL OF THAT.
CUT IT IN HALF.
- NEXT UP, COURTNEY ACT.
- G'DAY.
- YOU'RE GIVING ME
CHERYL TIEGS' "COSMO" COVER,
1976.
- I HONESTLY WANT
TO JUST SKIN YOU ALIVE
AND WEAR YOUR BODY.
YOUR BODY IS PHENOMENAL.
- I DID NOTICE
THAT YOU WERE TRIPPING UP
A LITTLE BIT ON YOUR SKIRT.
- IT'S JUST TOO LONG, I THINK.
- THANK YOU, COURTNEY.
LAST BUT NOT LEAST, MILK.
- SO, MILK,
DO YOU THINK THIS IS
REPRESENTATIVE OF WHO YOU ARE?
- YEAH. I HAVE A VERY QUIRKY
PERSONA AND STYLE.
I KNOW I'M NOT GOING
TO EVER FIT IN
WITH THOSE GLAMOROUS QUEENS,
AND SO, WHY NOT STAND OUT?
- YOU PROBABLY
COULD'VE LEFT OFF THE BEARD,
BECAUSE REALLY,
THE WHOLE ENSEMBLE
LOOKS LIKE A MILLION DOLLARS.
REALLY, IT'S LIKE
A FASHION ILLUSTRATION
JUST RIGHT OFF THE PAGE.
- YOU ARE OWNING EVERYTHING
OF WHO YOU ARE.
THAT'S WHAT I LOVE.
- ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, LADIES.
WHILE YOU UNTUCK
IN THE FORMDECOR LOUNGE,
THE JUDGES AND I
WILL DELIBERATE.
ALL RIGHT, JUST BETWEEN US
SQUIRREL FRIENDS,
LET'S START
WITH TRINITY KARDASHIAN BONET.
- I LOVE TRINITY'S CREATIVITY.
TRINITY BROUGHT
AN ENTIRE PERFORMANCE
TO THE RUNWAY.
- AFTER SHE TOOK THE PIZZA BOX
OFF FROM HER NECK,
I THOUGHT SHE WAS FIERCE.
- BIANCA DEL RIO.
LOVE THAT DRESS.
I WOULD WEAR THAT DRESS.
- I LOVED HER SENSE OF HUMOR.
SHE'S A QUEEN I'LL BE WATCHING.
- THE ONLY CRITIQUE
IS THE MAKEUP.
- YOU GOT TO BLEND.
- SISSY THAT FACE.
- YOU BETTER
SISSY THAT FACE, GIRL.
DARIENNE LAKE.
- SHE'S STUNNINGLY GORGEOUS.
- YEAH.
- BUT IT LOOKED LIKE
SHE WENT TO THE FANCY SECTION
AT DRESS BARN.
- UNFORGIVABLE IS THE RUCHING.
- THE COOCHIE RUCHING.
- OH, MY GOD.
THE PUFFY PUSS--
I CAN'T DEAL.
- MAGNOLIA CRAWFORD.
- GIRL, IF YOU'RE GOING
TO WEAR COW PRINT,
YOU BETTER CAMP THE HELL
OUT OF THAT DRESS.
- SURE, WEAR A BELL
AROUND YOUR NECK.
IT'S INTERESTING
WATCHING MAGNOLIA CRAWFORD
GET SO DEFENSIVE.
I TOTALLY RELATE TO IT,
I'VE BEEN THERE MYSELF.
- I GET IRRITATED
WHEN THEY TALK
ABOUT MY MARRIAGE OR MY SISTERS.
- SURE.
- BUT I WANT TO BE
A BETTER VERSION OF ME.
THAT TAKES CONSTANT WORK.
- AND IF YOU'RE GOING
TO BE DEFENSIVE,
THEN IT DEFEATS THE POINT.
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S MOVE ON TO JOSLYN FOX.
- I DON'T KNOW IF I COULD
FORGIVE THAT OUTFIT,
THE MIDSECTION HAD NO SHAPE.
- I DON'T MIND THAT OUTFIT.
IT'S NOT
LIKE SHE'S COMING OUT HERE
IN A CAREER WOMAN,
AND, YOU KNOW--
- NO, BUT THE CONSTRUCTION
WAS JUST A DISASTER.
- COURTNEY ACT.
- THERE WAS NOT MUCH GOING ON
TO THAT OUTFIT,
SO SHE DEFINITELY
WAS RELYING ON HER BODY,
WHICH, HEY,
IF YOU'VE GOT IT, RELY ON IT.
- YEAH.
- DO WHATEVER YOU CAN.
- BUT I JUST WOULD
EXPECT A LOT MORE FROM HER.
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S MOVE ON.
WHO WANTS MILK?
- HOPEFULLY,
MILK WILL BE ABLE
TO MAKE THE LOOK
MORE FEMININE WHEN WE ASK HER.
- WITH THAT SAID,
I THOUGHT IT WAS A BALLSY MOVE
TO COME OUT WITH A BEARD.
- I LIKE A BIG SET OF BALLS.
- YEAH, GIRL.
- YOU KNOW, HONEY, PLEASE.
- [LAUGHS]
- SILENCE.
I'VE MADE MY DECISION.
BRING BACK MY GIRLS.
[LAUGHS]
- [LAUGHS]
WELCOME BACK, LADIES.
I'VE MADE SOME DECISIONS.
TRINITY K. BONET,
YOU'RE SAFE.
BIANCA DEL RIO,
YOUR COUTURE
WAS A REAL MAUI WOWIE.
CONDRAGULATIONS,
YOU'RE THE WINNER
OF THIS WEEK'S CHALLENGE.
[APPLAUSE]
YOU'VE WON A $2,500
SHOPPING SPREE
FROM FABRIC PLANET.
MILK, FOR NOT PLAYING IT SAFE,
YOU'RE SAFE.
COURTNEY ACT.
BODY, 10,
COUTURE, 6.
YOU'RE SAFE.
MAGNOLIA CRAWFORD,
YOUR BOVINE DESIGN
WAS NOT DIVINE.
WHERE'S THE BEEF?
I'M SORRY, MY DEAR,
BUT YOU ARE UP FOR ELIMINATION.
DARIENNE LAKE,
YOUR FACE IS PAINTED
FOR THE AGES,
BUT YOUR RUCHE LOOKED RUSHED.
JOSLYN FOX,
YOUR COUTURE REMINDS ME
OF A WEDDING--
SOMETHING OLD, SOMETHING NEW,
SOMETHING BORROWED,
SOMETHING BLUE, GREEN, YELLOW,
PINK, RED, CHARTREUSE.
- [LAUGHS]
- JOSLYN FOX, YOU'RE SAFE.
DARIENNE, MY DEAR,
I'M SORRY,
BUT YOU ARE UP FOR ELIMINATION.
- IT'S JUST ME AND MAGNOLIA.
- GIVE ME THE FIRING SQUAD,
I'M READY.
- TWO QUEENS STAND BEFORE ME.
LADIES, THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE
TO IMPRESS ME
AND SAVE YOURSELF
FROM ELIMINATION.
THE TIME HAS COME
FOR YOU TO LIP-SYNC
FOR YOUR LIFE.
GOOD LUCK,
AND DON'T FUCK IT UP.
- I'M GOING TO SHOW THE JUDGES
THAT I'M FUNNY, FABULOUS,
AND THAT I HAVE A GREAT NOSE.
- I AM LOOKING AT THOSE JUDGES
DEAD IN THEIR EYE
AND GETTING
THAT GLANCE RIGHT BACK.
THIS IS WHAT YOU PAID FOR,
AND I'M GIVING YOU EXTRA.
- WHOO!
[APPLAUSE]
- [LAUGHS]
- WHOO!
- ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
I'VE MADE MY DECISION.
DARIENNE LAKE,
SHANTE, YOU STAY.
YOU MAY JOIN THE OTHER GIRLS.
- THANK YOU.
- MAGNOLIA CRAWFORD,
YOU HIT A WALL,
BUT THERE'S ONE THING
I KNOW FOR SURE--
YOU CAN'T KEEP A GOOD HO DOWN.
NOW, SASHAY AWAY.
- THANK YOU.
IT'S A SHAME THEY DIDN'T GET
TO LOVE ME AS MUCH AS I LOVE ME.
YEAH, I MIGHT HAVE COME ACROSS
A LITTLE ABRASIVE.
THE THING IS, ALL PUBLICITY
IS GOOD PUBLICITY.
SO, I'M GOING
TAKE IT AND RUN WITH IT.
PEACE THE FUCK OUT.
- CONDRAGULATIONS, LADIES.
ENJOY THIS MOMENT,
BECAUSE THERE ARE
6 MORE FIERCE QUEENS
READY TO SNATCH THE CROWN.
BITCHES BETTER BEWARE.
- OH, FUCK.
THE 6 OTHER BITCHES.
- IT'S LIKE TWO PRIDES OF LIONS
MEETING EACH OTHER
ON THE SERENGETI.
- THIS IS LIKE "THE OUTSIDERS."
I'M FROM AZUSA, OKAY?
I KNOW HOW STREET FIGHTS
GET DOWN.
- THEY'RE ALL TRYING
A LITTLE TOO HARD FOR MY TASTES,
ESPECIALLY
THAT KIMORA LEE KARDASHIAN.
I DON'T LIKE THEM.
DON'T LIKE THEM.


- PREVIOUSLY
ON "RUPAUL'S DRAG RACE"...
YOU'RE NOT THE FIRST
QUEENS TO ARRIVE.
7 QUEENS CAME,
AND ONE HAS ALREADY
SASHAYED AWAY.
- SERVE THAT FACE, GIRL,
WE'RE LOSING IT!
- YOU NEED TO CREATE YOUR BEST
LIFE-OF-THE-PARTY COUTURE.
DARIENNE LAKE.
- A LITTLE BORING HERE.
- I GET THIS ANGRY VIBE
FROM YOU.
- I...OKAY.
- BIANCA DEL RIO,
YOU'RE THE WINNER
OF THIS WEEK'S CHALLENGE.
[APPLAUSE]
- DARIENNE LAKE,
SHANTE, YOU STAY.
MAGNOLIA CRAWFORD, SASHAY AWAY.
ENJOY THIS MOMENT,
BECAUSE THERE ARE
6 MORE FIERCE QUEENS
READY TO SNATCH THE CROWN.
- OH, FUCK.
- I WALK INTO THE WORKROOM,
AND, OH, MY GOD.
IT'S THE OTHER GIRLS.
LOOK AT THESE WHORES.
- EXCUSE ME?
- WELL, HELLO. HUGS.
- GET ON OVER HERE, MISS THING.
- HI.
HAPPY MARDI GRAS.
- IT'S OUR FIRST TIME
TOGETHER AS A GROUP.
WE'RE ALL JUST KIND OF LIKE...
[SNIFFS]
SNIFFING AROUND EACH OTHER.
- WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
- TRINITY.
- TRINITY? BENDELACREME.
- MY FIRST IMPRESSION
OF BENDELACREME,
SHE KIND OF LOOKS LIKE
THE HAMBURGLAR'S WIFE.
[LAUGHS]
- MY NAME IS
MISS LAGANJA ESTRANJA,
HONEY, DARLING.
- LAGANJA, YOU ALL NO TEA.
- COME ON, NATCH.
- LAGANJA.
IRRITATING, YOUNG, FOOLISH.
- HI, I'M DARIENNE LAKE.
I'M FROM NEW YORK.
- DARIENNE.
YOU KNOW, MY GOD,
THERE'S ROOM FOR EVERYBODY.
LET'S JUST SAY THAT.
- I'M GLAD I'M NOT
THE ONLY "IDOL" CONTESTANT HERE.
I WAS ON "AMERICAN IDOL."
- I KNOW,
YOU WERE ON "AMERICAN IDOL."
- YES, I KNOW WHO YOU ARE.
- YOU WERE ON SEASON ONE?
- NO!
- "WHAT SEASON WERE YOU ON?
WERE YOU ON SEASON ONE?"
AND I WAS LIKE, "OH, WE'RE
PLAYING THAT THIS YEAR, BITCH?"
- WELL, YOU GIRLS...LOOK GOOD.
- THERE WAS
A SLIGHT PAUSE THERE.
- YOU GIRLS...
[COUGHS]
LOOK GOOD.
- I DIDN'T QUITE
COUGH LIKE A MAN,
BUT, YOU KNOW,
YOU GUYS LOOK GOOD.
- DON'T JUMP THE GUN YET,
MISS KIMORA LEE KARDASHIAN.
SHE NEEDS TO CALM DOWN.
- MY NAME IS GIA GUNN.
I DON'T JUMP GUNS,
I AM THE BOOM-BOOM GUN, HONEY.
- OH, IS THAT IT? IS THAT IT?
YOU CAN HANDLE IT,
BUT DON'T WORRY,
SOME OTHER BITCHES IN HERE KNOW
HOW TO THROW IT.
'KAY, 'KAY?
- AUNTY, THE STAGE
HAS ALREADY BEEN SET.
BOTH CLIQUES ARE TIGHT
WITHIN THEMSELVES.
THAT BONDING IS DONE.
IT'S GONNA BE,
"GIRLS, HOW ARE YOU DOING?"
- THE WINNER
OF "RUPAUL'S DRAG RACE"
RECEIVES A SICKENING SUPPLY
OF COLOREVOLUTION COSMETICS,
AND A CASH PRIZE OF $100,000.
WITH EXTRA-SPECIAL GUEST JUDGES,
"GAME OF THRONES'" LENA HEADEY
AND LINDA BLAIR.
- HELLO, HELLO, GOOD MORNING.
- OOH, BACK AGAIN, GIRL.
- WHO ARE ALL
OF THESE OTHER BOYS
WALKING INTO THE WORKROOM?
I'M NOT FEELING SOME
OF THE OTHER QUEENS.
I DON'T LIKE MESSY QUEENS,
I DON'T LIKE CHEAP QUEENS,
AND I DON'T LIKE MANLY QUEENS.
- SO WHAT DO WE THINK
IS GONNA HAPPEN TODAY?
- GUESS THERE'LL BE A SHEMAIL,
AND NOT THE GIA KIND.
- OOH.
[LAUGHTER]
[WOMAN SCREAMING]
- YOU'VE GOT SHEMAIL.
- COME ON, A SCREAM?
- RACERS!
WHERE ARE YOU?
I CAN'T FIND YOU.
LISTEN TO ME.
STAY AWAY FROM THE LIGHT.
STAY AWAY FROM THE LIGHT.
BITCH, I SAID,
GET THE HELL OUT OF MY LIGHT.
[LAUGHTER]
- AHH, THAT'S BETTER.
THEY'RE QUEER!
- [GASPING]
- WHAT?
- HELLO, HELLO, HELLO!
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
- HELLO, MAMA RU!
- HOW IS MY BLENDED DRAG FAMILY
GETTING ALONG?
[LAUGHTER]
- SICKENING.
- WELL, WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT.
NOW, I WANT YOU
TO PAIR UP WITH A QUEEN
THAT WAS NOT
IN YOUR ORIGINAL GROUP.
NOW, FOR TODAY'S MINI CHALLENGE,
EACH PAIR NEEDS
TO COMBINE BODIES
TO CREATE ONE LIP-SYNCHING,
BIKINI-WEARING BATHING BEAUTY,
INSPIRED BY OUR FRIENDS
AT ISLAND HOUSE KEY WEST
FIVE-STAR RESORT.
OH, SCRUFF PIT CREW!
- [WHOOPING]
- OH, YEAH!
- GO.
- ALL RIGHT, FIRST UP,
COURTNEY ACT
AND LAGANJA ESTRANJA.
WHO'S TOP, AND WHO'S BOTTOM?
- I'M THE BOTTOM.
- WHAT?
- OH, SORRY.
I'M THE TOP.
- [LAUGHS]
ALL RIGHT, ASSUME THE POSITION.
OH, IS THIS SEAT TAKEN?
HIT IT!
[LAUGHING]
- [LAUGHING]
- [LAUGHS]
[APPLAUSE]
WELL, LADIES,
YOU ALL DID SWIMMINGLY,
BUT THE WINNERS ARE...
MILK AND ADORE.
- YAY!
[APPLAUSE]
- NOW IT'S TIME
TO PUT THE FEAR IN FIERCE.
FOR THIS WEEK'S MAIN CHALLENGE,
YOU'LL BE SCREEN-TESTING
FOR A NEW HORROR FILM
FRANCHISE...
[DISTORTED VOICE]
"DRAG RACE ME TO HELL."
[LAUGHTER]
- WORKING IN TEAMS OF 6,
YOU'LL SERVE
SCARY MOVIE REALNESS
IN TWO SICKENING SCENES,
ONE SET IN THE SIXTIES
AND ONE IN THE EIGHTIES.
HASHTAG "SCREAMQUEENS."
MILK AND ADORE,
YOU ARE TEAM CAPTAINS.
HERE ARE YOUR SCRIPTS.
PICK YOUR SPOOK SISTERS.
- MISS BIANCA.
- I'M SPOOKY.
- MISS LAGANJA ESTRANJA.
- COME ON, GIRL, LET'S SCREAM.
- [LAUGHS]
- DARIENNE LAKE.
- OH, THIS IS NOT
LIKE GYM CLASS.
[GIGGLES]
- DELACREME.
- [LAUGHS]
- MISS COURTNEY ACT.
- GIA GUNN.
[LAUGHS]
- JOSLYN.
- WE'LL BE A SCREAM.
[LAUGHTER]
- APRIL.
- OH, YES.
- TRINITY KARDASHIAN.
- THAT, OF COURSE, MEANS
VIVACIOUS GOES TO TEAM ADORE.
- COME, DARLING, COME.
- OH, YEAH.
- VERY INTERESTING.
YOU CHOSE THE QUEENS
FROM YOUR ORIGINAL GROUPS.
- OF COURSE I CHOSE MY GROUP.
THEY'RE THE BEE'S KNEES.
THAT FIRST GROUP
HAS SOME PRETTY BITCHES,
BUT I DON'T LIKE THEM.
- GENTLEMEN, START YOUR ENGINES,
AND MAY THE BEST WOMAN...
[SCREAMING]
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
- BYE, RU.
- [SCREAMING]
[LAUGHTER]
- JUST DIE ALREADY.
[LAUGHTER]
- OKAY, EVERYONE...
OH, I LOVE THIS.
I'M A HUGE FAN
OF EIGHTIES HORROR MOVIES.
SO, AS SOON AS I FOUND OUT
THAT IT WAS THE EIGHTIES
VERSION, I WAS FREAKING OUT.
OKAY, I'M HEATHER,
YOU'RE BECKY.
- OKAY.
- YOU'RE THE CRAZY MOTHER.
- YES.
- [SPEAKING ENGLISH]
- YOU WANT TO BE
SCARY HEAD IN THE BOX?
AT THIS POINT,
WE HAVE LIMITED TIME.
I'VE JUST GOT TO HAND
THIS SHIT OUT
LIKE IT WAS CANDY
OUT OF A PINATA.
CATCH IT, BITCH,
BECAUSE YOU'RE GETTING THE ROLE.
HOLD ON, WHERE AM I?
- PLEASE, DON'T LET ME BE BUTCH.
- AND THEN YOU'D BE
THE BUTCH REAL-ESTATE AGENT.
- YOU COULD DO THAT, NO?
- YEAH.
"STOP! WHAT THE HELL?
I'M A WORKING LADY."
- THERE IS NOTHING MANLY
ON APRIL,
SO SHE'S GOT
SOME STRETCHING TO DO.
- SASHAY AWAY.
- EW, GAG ME WITH A...
"DALARIAN."
WHAT IS IT?
- A DELOREAN.
- DELOREAN. WHAT'S THAT?
- IT'S, LIKE, AN EIGHTIES CAR.
- OH, OKAY.
I'VE NEVER HEARD OF A DELOREAN.
FOR ALL I KNOW,
IT'S A FUCKING ANCIENT DILDO.
I HAVE NO IDEA.
- WELL, NOT MY FATHER...
BECAUSE...BECAUSE
I DON'T HAVE A FATHER.
- I'M A LITTLE WORRIED,
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW
THAT SOME OF MY TEAMMATES
CAN DO THEIR ROLES.
ADORE COULD HAVE DONE BETTER,
BUT, SINK OR SWIM,
SHE IS THE LEADER.
- COMING UP...
ACTION!
- [SCREAMING]
- OKAY.
[LAUGHING]
- [LAUGHING]
- I THINK YOU WOULD BE
A GOOD MRS. BATES.
- IT DOESN'T MATTER TO ME,
I LIKE ALL OF THEM.
- OUR TEAM GETS
"DRAG RACE ME TO HELL,"
THE ORIGINAL,
SET IN THE SIXTIES.
I'M EXCITED
BECAUSE THE ORIGINAL
IS ALWAYS BETTER
THAN THE SEQUEL.
- I WAS THINKING MRS. HITCHCOCK
WITH A BRITISH ACCENT,
BECAUSE I'VE GOT AN ACCENT.
- OKAY, SO, SCARY HEAD IN A BOX.
DARIENNE, SCARY HEAD IN A BOX?
- SURE.
NOBODY WANTS THIS
"HEAD IN A BOX" ROLE.
IT'S A SMALLER ROLE,
AND IT'S JUST A HEAD IN A BOX,
BUT I CAN DO SOMETHING WITH IT.
- YOU COULD BE SLUTTY SALLY.
- [SPEAKING ENGLISH]
- YEAH.
ALL RIGHT.
SO, I THINK WE'RE GOING TO
STICK WITH THESE CHARACTERS.
- ALL RIGHT.
- I REALIZE MY CHARACTER
HAS THE MOST LINES,
AND NOW I'M PISSED,
BECAUSE I'VE GOT
TO LEARN A LOT OF SHIT,
AND I AM NOT AN ACTOR.
COME ON, SANDRA DEE...
OH. COME ON, SANDRA DEE,
IT'S TIME TO PUT...
POP YOUR CHERRY.
- WHAT IF YOU DID IT, LIKE,
"LET'S GET REAL, GIRL?"
LIKE, "SHUT UP, GIRL,
IT'S JUST ME."
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
- OH, YOU WANT ME TO BE BLACK?
- WELL, I THINK IT'D BE FUNNIER.
- THE BLACK GIRL IS PLAYING
GHETTO. HOW ORIGINAL.
- TRINITY SAID SHE WOULD LIKE
TO LEARN FROM EVERYONE,
AND SHE DOESN'T CONSIDER HERSELF
A PROFESSIONAL ACTRESS.
BUT SHE'S LIKE
VERY, VERY DEFENSIVE.
SHE NEVER WANTS TO HEAR IT.
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S MEMORIZE
THESE LINES, BITCHES.
[THUNDER]
- WELCOME, TEAM MILK.
NOW, THIS IS YOUR SCREEN TEST.
ACT AS IF YOUR LIFE
DEPENDED ON IT,
BECAUSE, WELL...
IT DOES.
ALL RIGHT, PLACES, PEOPLE.
PEOPLE, PLACES!
OKAY, HERE WE GO.
WE'RE ROLLING, AND...
ACTION.
- OH, MRS. HITCHCOCK,
DID YOU SEE
THE FULL MOON TONIGHT?
PRESIDENT KENNEDY SAID ONE DAY
HE'LL PUT A MAN UP THERE.
- WELL, I'M MORE INTERESTED
IN EXPLORING
YOUR FEMININE MYSTIQUE.
- [SNORTS]
- BIANCA AND COURTNEY
IS FLYING THROUGH THEIR LINES
LIKE THEY'VE BEEN DOING
MOVIES FOR YEARS.
BITCHES.
- "THERE WILL BE BLOOD."
- NO!
[SCREAMING]
- AND CUT.
VERY GOOD.
YOU BITCHES
HAVE BEEN SLAYED BEFORE.
[LAUGHTER]
- HELLO?
SALLY, ARE YOU HERE?
- RING, RING.
- GASP!
- [CHUCKLES]
- JOSLYN IS TOTALLY SELLING IT.
MUCH FUNNIER THAN I EXPECTED.
- GASP!
- GASP!
- JEEZ, BETTY, IT'S JUST ME.
DON'T FLIP YOUR WIG.
- THAT'S NOT FUNNY.
EVER SINCE THEY INVENTED
BIRTH CONTROL, YOU...
- CUT.
TRINITY, YOU HAVE
TO PLAY TO THE CAMERA,
BECAUSE WE CAN'T SEE YOU
WHEN YOU TURN AROUND.
- WE'RE GOING TO POP
YOUR CHERRY TONIGHT.
THE BOYS ARE COMING OVER.
- CUT, CUT, CUT, CUT, CUT.
TRINITY, I DON'T KNOW
WHY YOUR BACK IS TURNED.
- YOU KNOW,
THAT WAS MY CHARACTER,
KIND OF LIKE SASSY GHETTO.
- WELL, JUST BE SASSY GHETTO
FACING YOUR CAMERA.
SEE, OVER HERE, YOU KEEP DOING
THIS THING WHEN YOU'RE GOING,
"SO AND SO AND SO
AND SO AND SO."
AND THEN,
SO WE KEEP SEEING THIS.
WE DON'T WANT TO SEE THAT.
- I'VE NEVER SEEN RUPAUL
LITERALLY GET OUT HIS SEAT
AND HAVE TO SHOW SOMEBODY
WHERE A CAMERA IS,
AND IT REALLY THREW ME OFF.
SORRY, GUYS.
- ALL RIGHT, MOVING ON.
- SASHAY AWAY,
AND WHATEVER YOU DO,
DON'T LOOK IN THE PINK BOX.
- YOUR MOTHER
DARNS SOCKS IN HELL!
- [LAUGHS]
- CUT.
- TRINITY,
WHEN YOU PICK THAT BOX UP,
THERE NEEDS TO BE A REACTION.
THERE'S A HEAD ON A TABLE
WITH A SATANIC STAR ON IT.
- GOT YOU.
- I MAY ACTUALLY
PASS OUT IN THIS BOX
IF TRINITY CONTINUES TO FUCK UP.
I MAY END UP
PUNCHING HER IN HER BOX
IF SHE DOESN'T STOP FUCKING UP.
- WELCOME, TEAM ADORE.
- I'M NOT WORRIED
ABOUT THIS CHALLENGE,
BECAUSE I GOT
THE SHIT STRATEG...
STRATEGICALLY, WHATEVER.
I HAVE IT STRATEGICALLY
STRATEGIZED.
THIS IS GOING TO GO GOOD.
I'M A GOOD LEADER,
I'M A LIBRA.
- APRIL AND LAGANJA,
YOU ALL READY?
- [SPEAKING ENGLISH]
- ALL RIGHT, READY, SET, ACTION.
- YEAH.
- THIS PLACE IS GOING CONDO.
IF YOU DON'T BUY IT,
SOME YUPPIE WILL.
- YOU HAVE A HEAD
FOR BUSINESS.
LET'S GET PHYSICAL.
- STOP!
OH, WHAT THE HELL.
- OKAY.
LET'S CUT.
- AM I TOO BOYISH?
- IT'S YOUR CHOICE.
- OKAY, COOL.
PLAYING A BUTCH CHARACTER
FOR A DRAG QUEEN
IS A MINDFUCK, REALLY.
I'M A GAY BOY BEING A WOMAN,
BUT I NEED TO BE BOYISH AS WELL.
- ALL RIGHT, WE'RE MOVING ON.
- AY, DIOS MIO.
- ACTION.
- HEATHER?
HELLO?
- RING, RING.
- WHAT IS THAT?
OH, MY NEW CELL PHONE.
- CUT.
- GIA, DON'T FORGET
THE GREAT LINES,
LIKE, "OH, DUH,
MY NEW CELL PHONE."
LIKE, THOSE "DUHS" REALLY
GIVE IT THE EIGHTIES FLAIR.
- OKAY.
- DUH.
ACTION.
- LIKE, HELLO?
WHO IS THIS?
WHERE DID YOU GET THIS NUMBER?
- ADORE, THAT'S YOUR CUE.
- OH, FUCK, YES.
YOU'RE GOING TO DIE!
- [SCREAMING]
- AND THEN YOU HAVE...
DIALOGUE AFTER THAT.
- DON'T HAVE A COW, HEATHER.
- HER NAME IS BECKY,
YOUR NAME IS HEATHER.
- SHIT.
- NO. DO YOU ALL HAVE
YOUR LINES MEMORIZED?
- YEAH.
- LIZA MINNELLI LIES.
- OKAY.
- I COULD NOT GO ON THE STAGE
WITHOUT KNOWING MY LINES.
THAT'S JUST UNCALLED FOR.
ADORE IS THE TEAM CAPTAIN,
AND I FEEL SO WORRIED
FOR OUR TEAM,
BECAUSE SHE'S NOT PROFESSIONAL.
- WHATEVER YOU DO,
DON'T TOUCH THIS BIG,
PINK, FURRY BOX.
NO, DON'T TOUCH
MY BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTER'S...
- YOUR MOTHER SCRUBS DOCKS IN...
- SORRY, I STEPPED ON YOUR LINE.
- CUT, CUT, CUT.
DID YOU GUYS REHEARSE AS A TEAM
BEFORE YOU CAME ON?
I'LL TAKE THAT AS A WHOPPING NO.
- SO BASICALLY I'M FUCKED,
BECAUSE I'M THE TEAM LEADER,
AND EVERYTHING COMES ON MY BACK.
- COMING UP...
- MY LIFELONG DREAM
IS TO BE BEYONCE IN VEGAS.
- AND YOU ARE BEYONCE.
- OH, I AM.
- [LAUGHING]
- [LAUGHING]
- OH, GIRL,
SO GOOD TO BE HOME, EH?
TODAY'S RUNWAY IS OUR BEST DRAG.
MAMA IS LIVING, OKAY?
- SO WHAT TYPE OF DRAG
DO YOU DO IN NEW YORK?
- I DO, LIKE, THE REALLY OLD
TRADITIONAL CLUB'S KIDS
LEIGH BOWERY STYLE OF DRAG.
- OH.
- I GREW UP AROUND
THE REAL CLUB KIDS,
PEOPLE LIKE AMANDA LEPORE,
LADY BUNNY, AND LAVINIA,
WHO USED TO COME DRESSED
AS A FURNACE,
WITH FIRE COMING
OUT OF HER MIDSECTION.
THERE WERE NO BOUNDARIES,
WHEN YOU WERE GOING
TO WALK INTO A CLUB,
WHAT THEY WERE GOING TO HAVE ON.
MY COSTUMES ARE VERY ABSTRACT,
AND A LOT OF GIRLS ARE LIKE,
"WELL, MISS THING,
THAT LOOK'S NOT GOING GET YOU
ANYWHERE WHATSOEVER."
- WELL, I WAS GOING
TO ASK YOU THAT.
YOU NEVER FELT THE NEED
TO WANT TO REVAMP YOURSELF?
- THE NEWER GENERATION
ONLY KNOW OFF THE FISHY LOOK,
BUT WHEN I WALK INTO A CLUB,
ALL EYES ARE ON ME.
YOU'RE STILL
THAT LITTLE GIRL IN THE CORNER
STILL TRYING
TO LOOK LIKE A LADY.
- MY LIFELONG DREAM IS TO BE
AN ILLUSIONIST IN VEGAS.
I WOULD LOVE TO BE
BEYONCE IN VEGAS.
- YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER
THOSE GIRLS ARE VERY SEASONED.
THEY'RE NOT TWO YEARS
INTO THE GAME.
THOSE GIRLS ARE,
LIKE, 15, 10 YEARS...
- BUT I MEAN,
THE BRITNEY SPEARS ILLUSIONIST,
SHE'S NOT 15 YEARS
INTO THE BUSINESS.
- YEAH, BUT SHE REALLY
LOOKS LIKE BRITNEY.
I HAVEN'T SEEN ANYBODY
THAT LOOKS LIKE BEYONCE.
YOU CAN PAINT
TO BE DIONNE WARWICK,
YOU CAN PAINT TO BE DIANA ROSS,
BUT BEYONCE IS JUST PRETTY.
- [SPEAKING ENGLISH]
- REALLY, BITCH?
BEYONCE IS A HARD ONE TO DO.
YOU CAN DANCE IT,
YOU CAN LIP-SYNC IT,
BUT IF YOU DON'T REALLY
LOOK LIKE HER, HMM.
AND LET'S FACE IT, TRINITY
LOOKS MORE LIKE SAMMY DAVIS JR.
IN A BEYONCE WIG.
- I COULD JUST
START MY OWN SHOW.
YOU KNOW, MY OWN ILLUSION SHOW,
AND TRY TO GET SOME
REALLY GOOD GIRLS THERE.
- THAT'S THE TICKET.
- SEE IF IT'LL BUILD UP.
- YEP, GOT IT ALL FIGURED OUT.
I WAS JUST SAYING THAT WHEN...
OH, WHATEVER, GIRL.
IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE
THAT FUCKING SENSITIVE.
- I'M NOT SENSITIVE AT ALL!
- OH, I FORGOT,
YOU'RE NOT SENSITIVE.
YOU'RE BEYONCE.
- OH, I AM.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
- WELCOME TO THE MAIN STAGE
OF "RUPAUL'S DRAG RACE."
MICHELLE VISAGE,
I KNOW WHAT YOU DID
LAST SUMMER.
- IT IS GETTING SEVERE
UP IN HERE, MY QUEEN.
- SANTINO RICE,
ARE YOU DARK-SIDED?
- [LAUGHS]
- AND "GAME OF THRONES'"
LENA HEADEY.
WELCOME, MY QUEEN.
- THANK YOU.
- AND THE LEGENDARY LINDA BLAIR.
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE HERE,
MY HEAD IS SPINNING.
- [LAUGHS]
- THIS WEEK WE CHALLENGED
OUR SCREAM QUEENS
TO HORROR IT UP IN SCREEN TESTS
FOR A CREATURE DOUBLE FEATURE.
TONIGHT, THEY'RE READY
TO SLAY THE RUNWAY
IN THEIR BEST DRAG.
GENTLEMEN, START YOUR ENGINES,
AND MAY THE BEST WOMAN WIN.
- FIRST UP, BIANCA DEL RIO.
- HOLLYWOOD.
- THAT'S A COLLAR, HONEY.
- SHE'S GOT BLING
AROUND THE COLLAR.
- MY BEST DRAG IS OLD HOLLYWOOD,
AND I'M FEELING LIKE A BITCH
WHO JUST BURIED
HER THIRD HUSBAND.
- BLACK WIDOW.
SHE MATES, SHE KILLS.
- AND THEN SHE WEARS IT.
- AUSTRALIA'S OWN COURTNEY ACT.
- AUSSIE PRIDE.
- IT'S FLAG DAY.
- IT'S VEGEMITE-Y SEXY.
- I FEEL LIKE
AN AUSTRALIAN VERSION
OF THE STATUE OF LIBERTY.
I'M WALKING DOWN THE RUNWAY
DOING MY COUNTRY PROUD.
- LOOK AT THAT GREAT
BARRIER REEF.
- [LAUGHS]
- JOSLYN FOX.
- FOX ON THE RUN.
THAT LOOKS LIKE ONE OF LINDA'S
OUTFITS FROM "ROLLER BOOGIE."
- YEAH.
- I THINK IT IS.
- I'M SERVING UP
DISCO PARTY GIRL REALNESS.
I'VE NEVER BEEN SO CONFIDENT
IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.
- LA MAY SHANTE.
LA MAY, LA MAY, LA MAY.
TRINITY K. BONET,
FROM ATLANTA, G.A.
I THINK I'VE GOT
AN ORANGE CRUSH.
- MY OUTFIT OF CHOICE
IS A BEAUTIFUL, EXPENSIVE GOWN.
- TANGERINE DREAM.
- YES. LADY MARMALADE.
- [LAUGHS]
- MILK.
WOW!
SHE'S GOT A REAL NOSE
FOR FASHION.
- [LAUGHS]
- [IMITATING PINOCCHIO]
I'M A REAL QUEEN.
[NORMAL VOICE]
LIAR, LIAR, LIAR.
- I'M COMING AT YOU
WITH A LONG PINOCCHIO NOSE,
LONG LEGS.
I'M JUST
A CRAZY-LOOKING SUPERMODEL.
- PINOCCHI-HO.
- AND HER DADDY GEPPET-HO.
[LAUGHTER]
- DARIENNE LAKE. OH!
- OOH!
- NOTHING SAYS QUEEN
LIKE A CAPE.
- [CHUCKLING]
THAT'S RIGHT.
- THERE'S ONE THING THAT I KNOW.
IT'S BEST DRAG.
LOTS OF HAIR, LOTS OF LASHES,
LOTS OF SPARKLE.
- SUPER QUEEN.
- I BELIEVE SHE COULD FLY.
- [LAUGHS]
- APRIL CARRION.
- APRIL SHOWERS.
- YES.
I THINK SHE'S GOT ME ALL WET.
- I AM SERVING
"SINGING IN THE RAIN" REALNESS.
I'M LIVING FOR THIS OUTFIT.
- THE FORECAST IS GORGEOUS.
MAKE IT RAIN, GIRL,
MAKE IT RAIN.
LAGANJA ESTRANJA,
SERVING UP YOUNG MAGGIE SMITH.
- I'M FASCINATED
BY YOUR HAT, GIRL.
- I AM SERVING
"MADAME BUTTERFLY" TONIGHT.
I FEEL LIKE A PEACH
ICE CREAM CONE.
- YES, HONEY,
THIS IS THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT.
- OKAY.
- SHE'LL NEVER GET THAT DRESS
BACK INTO THE COCOON.
GI-GI-GI-GIA!
NINJA PRINCESS!
- GROOVE IS IN THE HEART.
- THAT'S RIGHT.
- I'M SERVING
POWER RANGER MEETS NINJAS,
AND I'M FEELING MY HEADPIECE,
BECAUSE I KNOW
SHE'S REAL DIFFERENT.
I LOOK FUCKING EXPENSIVE.
- OH, THAT'S RIGHT.
SEE, I KNOW SHE'S FROM CHICAGO
WITH THOSE MOVES.
AND ALL THAT ASS, YES.
ADORE DELANO.
- MER-WENCH.
- RED WIG AT NIGHT,
SAILOR'S DELIGHT.
- I'M REALLY FEELING GOOD
ABOUT THIS RUNWAY.
I'M JUST STRUTTING IT
LIKE A BEAUTIFUL MERMAID STAR.
- RAGGEDY ANN
SURE GREW UP TO BE A SLUT.
[LAUGHTER]
- BENDELACREME.
WELL, HELLO, KITTY.
- MEOW, MEOW.
- [PURRS]
- I'M REALLY JUST GIVING FUN,
A LITTLE BIT OF PINUP,
A LITTLE BIT GOOFY,
JUST SHOW THEM THERE'S
A LITTLE SEX KITTEN IN ME.
- NOW, HONESTLY, DO YOU THINK
THAT BOW CONSTRICTS HER?
- [LAUGHS]
- THE PLAYBOY CLUB.
- THAT'S WHY THE DOGS
CHASE THE CAT.
V-V-VIVACIOUS.
- OH!
ONE OF THE STRANGEST THINGS
I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE.
- BUT WAIT A MINUTE,
DIDN'T YOU DATE RICK JAMES?
- [LAUGHS]
- THIS IS ONE OF VIVACIOUS'
ICONIC PIECES.
I AM SERVING VIVACIOUS DOWN.
- VERY "GAME OF CONES."
- [LAUGHS]
- COMING UP...
- I GOT BOY.
- YOU WERE THE LEAST PREPARED.
- YOU'RE NOT REALLY
EMBRACING FULLY.
- I'M A STAR.
- [LAUGHING]
- [LAUGHING]
WELCOME, LADIES.
LET'S WATCH THE SCREEN TEST
FOR "DRAG RACE ME TO HELL,"
STARRING TEAM MILK.
- OH, MRS. HITCHCOCK,
DID YOU SEE
THE FULL MOON TONIGHT?
- I'M MORE INTERESTED
IN EXPLORING
YOUR FEMININE MYSTIQUE.
- PEEK-A-RU, I SEE YOU.
- DID YOU HEAR THAT?
- ALL I CAN HEAR
IS THE BEATING OF YOUR HEART.
- OH, MRS. HITCHCOCK, STOP.
STOP, STOP!
OKAY, WHAT THE HELL?
[MANIACAL LAUGHTER]
- [SCREAMING]
- HELLO? SALLY?
[TELEPHONE RINGS]
- GASP!
HELLO?
- PEEK-A-RU, I SEE YOU.
- WHO IS THIS?
- [MANIACAL LAUGHTER]
- YOU'RE GOING TO DIE.
- [SCREAMS]
- JEEZ, BETTY, IT'S JUST ME!
- THAT'S NOT FUNNY.
- COME ON, SANDRA DEE,
LET'S FIND JOHNNY.
- SASHAY AWAY!
- GASP!
- DON'T LOOK IN THE BIG,
PINK, FURRY BOX.
- I BET AIN'T NOBODY TOUCHED
YOUR BOX IN A LONG TIME.
- YOUR MOTHER
DARNS SOCKS IN HELL.
- [SCREAMS]
- LEAVE MY BEAUTIFUL
DAUGHTER'S HEAD ALONE.
- SHUT UP, MOTHER,
I CAN TAKE CARE OF MYSELF.
- DON'T SASS ME, GIRL,
MOTHER KNOWS BEST.
- YOU RUIN EVERYTHING.
- I'LL NEVER FORGIVE THOSE GIRLS
WHO TEASED YOU AT SCHOOL.
- MOTHER, I'M NOT A MONSTER.
- SHOVING YOUR HEAD
INTO THE LOCKERS.
- MOTHER, SHUT UP.
- NO, YOU SHUT UP.
- [SCREAMS]
- NOT MY BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTER!
- CATCH!
- YOU KILLED MY BABY!
[CRYING HYSTERICALLY]
- LET'S GO.
- PEEK-A-RU.
- GASP!
- LIKE MY LOOK?
COULDN'T YOU JUST...
DIE?
- NO!
- NO!
- OH, NO.
- [LAUGHS]
[LAUGHTER]
[APPLAUSE]
- NEXT UP,
"DRAG RACE ME TO HELL 5,"
STARRING TEAM ADORE.
- THIS PLACE IS GOING CONDO.
IF YOU DON'T BUY IT,
SOME YUPPIE WILL.
- YOU'VE GOT
A BRAIN FOR BUSINESS.
LET'S GET PHYSICAL.
- PEEK-A-RU, I SEE YOU.
- WHAT WAS THAT?
DID YOU HEAR THAT?
- I JUST HEAR
YOUR THROBBING SUGAR ROLLS.
- STOP!
OH, WHAT THE HELL,
MAKE MY RIVER RUN.
- [LAUGHS MANIACALLY]
- [SCREAMS]
- [SCREAMING]
- HEATHER?
[CELL PHONE RINGS]
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?
OH, MY NEW CELL PHONE.
LIKE, HELLO?
- PEEK-A-RU, I SEE YOU.
- WAIT, WHAT?
- [LAUGHS MANIACALLY]
- WHO IS THIS?
- YOU'RE GOING TO DIE!
- [SCREAMS]
- DON'T HAVE A COW,
THE GUYS ARE MEETING US HERE.
- THAT'S SO NOT FUNNY, HEATHER.
- YOU'RE JUST BITTER
BECAUSE YOU'RE STILL A VIRGIN.
- I'M NOT A VIRGIN,
I'M A VEGAN. KEEP UP.
I HOPE BRAD'S UP
FOR A THREE-WAY.
- BITCHING.
- SASHAY AWAY.
- GAG ME WITH A DELOREAN!
- WHATEVER YOU DO,
DON'T LOOK INSIDE
THIS BIG, PINK, FURRY BOX.
- WHAT'S YOUR DAMAGE,
BETTY KRUEGER?
- YOUR MOTHER
SCRUBS DOCKS IN HELL.
- [SCREAMS]
- DON'T TOUCH MY BEAUTIFUL
DAUGHTER'S HEAD.
- SHUT UP, MOTHER.
IT'S BECAUSE OF YOU
I HAVE BODY ISSUES.
NO BODY, NO FATHER.
NO WONDER I'M A MAD RAMPAGE
BITCH MONSTER.
- SHUT UP!
- [SCREAMS]
- MY BABY GIRL!
- CATCH!
- YOU'VE KILLED HER!
[SCREAMS]
- LET'S, LIKE,
GET OUT OF HERE ALREADY.
- I KNOW, RIGHT?
- PEEK-A-RU.
- WHAT THE HELL?
- THIS IS THE BEGINNING
OF THE REST OF YOUR AFTERLIFE.
[LAUGHS MANIACALLY]
- WOW.
SOMETHING TELLS ME THAT OUR TEAM
IS PROBABLY ON THE LOWER END
OF THE SCALE.
- THAT WAS ELECTRIFYING.
- I FOUND IT A LITTLE FUNNY THAT
THEIRS WAS IN BLACK AND WHITE
AND OURS WAS IN COLOR.
- [SPEAKING ENGLISH]
- NO.
- COMING UP...
- THE PERFORMANCE WAS FLAT.
- I FEEL LIKE SHIT.
- SILENCE!
[LAUGHING]
- [LAUGHING]
YOU GIRLS WERE A REAL SCREAM,
BUT ONE GROUP
WAS BLOODY FABULOUS.
TEAM...
MILK, CONDRAGULATIONS.
YOU ARE ALL SAFE
FROM ELIMINATION THIS WEEK.
TRINITY, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
- I JUST, FOR A MOMENT, I REALLY
THOUGHT I PUT YOU GUYS DOWN,
AND I'M A VIRGIN ACTOR,
BUT THANK YOU
FOR SEEING THAT I TRIED.
- YOU HAD US SCARED AT FIRST,
BUT YOU TOOK DIRECTION,
AND IT SHOWS.
- THANK YOU.
- DARIENNE LAKE...
NOW, FOR GIVING YOUR TALKING
HEAD, BODY, AND SOUL,
YOU ARE THE WINNER
OF THIS WEEK'S MAIN CHALLENGE.
- WHAT?
[APPLAUSE]
- YOU'VE WON
A FIVE-NIGHT STAY FOR TWO
AT THE ISLAND HOUSE
KEY WEST FIVE-STAR RESORT.
TEAM MILK,
YOU MAY LEAVE THE STAGE.
TEAM ADORE, IT'S TIME
FOR THE JUDGES' CRITIQUES.
LET'S START WITH APRIL CARRION.
- HELLO!
- I LOVE THE UMBRELLA,
LOVE THE COLOR,
AND I FIND YOU
ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL.
- BUT THE PERFORMANCE
AS A BUTCH REAL-ESTATE AGENT
WAS FLAT.
I DIDN'T REALLY GET BUTCH,
I GOT BOY.
- NEXT UP, LAGANJA ESTRANJA.
- HELLO, MAMA RU.
- I LOVE YOUR FASCINATOR,
THE BUTTERFLY HAT.
IT'S A GOOD LOOK FOR YOU.
- IN THE MOVIE, YOU DID OKAY.
- BUT YOU WERE CARRYING
APRIL THROUGH IT.
WHEN YOU'RE IN THAT SITUATION,
YOU CAN'T RELY
ON THE OTHER PERSON
TO GIVE YOU THE ENERGY
TO KEEP YOU GOING.
YOU HAVE TO FIND IT
WITHIN YOURSELF.
- NEXT UP, GIA GUNN.
- I LIKED YOUR PERFORMANCE,
I THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY.
I THOUGHT YOU TOTALLY
CHANNELED VALLEY VIRGIN.
- WELL, IT'S FUNNY, GIA,
BECAUSE ON THE SET
YOU COULDN'T REMEMBER
A LOT OF THE DIALOGUE,
AND IT LOOKED LIKE
YOU HAD A TECHNIQUE,
BUT YOU AND I BOTH KNOW
THAT THERE WAS
NO TECHNIQUE, RIGHT?
[LAUGHTER]
- NEXT UP, ADORE DELANO.
- ARE YOU CINCHED?
- NO.
- YEAH.
- I HAVE A HOG BODY RIGHT NOW.
- SO, YOU WERE THE TEAM LEADER.
- I WAS.
- AND HOW'D YOU ASSIGN
THE OTHER ROLES?
- LIKE THIS: YOU HAVE THAT,
YOU HAVE THAT,
AND YOU HAVE THAT.
- SO, YOU MIGHT WANT
TO THINK ABOUT THINGS,
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE THERE
IS A GAME BEING PLAYED HERE.
- AND OF ALL THE GIRLS,
YOU WERE THE LEAST PREPARED.
MY GUESS IS THAT,
BECAUSE YOU'RE CHARISMATIC,
YOU'VE BEEN ABLE TO SAIL BY
WITHOUT HAVING
TO PUT THE WORK IN.
YOU OWE IT TO YOUR TALENT
TO DO YOUR HOMEWORK.
- I FEEL LIKE SHIT,
LIKE IF I, LIKE, LET YOU DOWN.
I'M CONSTANTLY PROVING MYSELF
WITHIN THE DRAG COMMUNITY,
AND I'M HERE TO PROVE TO YOU
AND TO EVERYBODY I'M A STAR.
- STARS PUT IN THE WORK.
ALL RIGHT, NEXT UP,
BENDELACREME.
- YOU DELIVERED A VERY GOOD
PERFORMANCE IN THE MOVIE.
YOU HAD JUST
ONE OF THE BEST SCREAMS.
- THANK YOU, BUT I'M WORRIED
ABOUT YOU SITTING
SO CLOSE TO MICHELLE'S EARRING.
[LAUGHTER]
- [BUZZES]
- NEXT UP, VIVACIOUS.
- SEE, THIS TYPE OF LOOK
I DON'T HATE,
BECAUSE I GREW UP WITH IT,
AND SO DID RU.
- SURE.
- SO I APPRECIATE WHAT IT IS
THAT YOU'RE DOING.
- RIGHT.
- WITH THAT SAID, THE ACTING,
BECAUSE YOU WERE UNSURE
OF WHAT YOU WERE SAYING,
YOU WEREN'T ABLE TO KIND
OF GIVE IT ALL YOU'VE GOT.
- I FEEL LIKE YOU'RE NOT
REALLY EMBRACING FULLY.
- IN MY DEFENSE,
I HAVE NO THEATRICAL
BACKGROUND WHATSOEVER.
- LOOK AT YOURSELF.
WHAT YOU DO FOR A LIVING
IS THEATER!
- ARE YOU HOLDING YOUR HEADPIECE
BACK SO THAT YOU CAN HEAR?
- YES.
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE DOING THAT
MARIAH CAREY THING, YOU KNOW,
WHERE SHE HOLDS
HER EAR LIKE THAT.
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
- ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
WHILE YOU UNWIND
IN THE UNTUCKED LOUNGE,
THE JUDGES AND I
WILL DELIBERATE.
ALL RIGHT, NOW,
JUST BETWEEN US SHE-DEVILS,
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
STARTING WITH APRIL CARRION.
- I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SEEN
A LITTLE BETTER WORK
IN THE FILM.
- YEAH, I THINK THAT APRIL
WAS MISCAST IN THIS ROLE.
- ADORE WAS THE TEAM LEADER,
AND SO, THEREFORE,
SHOULD SHE BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE
FOR HANDING OUT THE JOBS?
- THAT'S A VERY GOOD POINT.
ALL RIGHT, MOVING ON
TO LAGANJA ESTRANJA.
- THERE'S SOMETHING
ABOUT HER I LOVE.
I THINK SHE'S
INCREDIBLY CHARMING.
THE ACTING WAS...
- SHE DIDN'T SUCK.
- I'M SAYING SHE DIDN'T SUCK.
- I THINK IT WAS PARTLY
BECAUSE HER SCREEN PARTNER
WAS APRIL CARRION
EVEN TONGUE KISSING
COULDN'T SAVE IT.
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S MOVE ON.
GIA GUNN.
- I JUST DIDN'T FEEL
LIKE IT WAS HER BEST DRAG.
AS FAR AS HER PERFORMANCE,
IT WAS FLAT.
- BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW FAMILIAR
SOME OF THEM ARE WITH ACTING.
AGE DOES HAVE TO DO
A LITTLE BIT WITH IT.
- BUT YOU WERE NOMINATED
FOR AN ACADEMY AWARD
WHEN YOU WERE 12 YEARS OLD.
- YES, BUT I'D BEEN WORKING
SINCE I WAS 6.
[LAUGHTER]
- LET'S GO TO ADORE DELANO.
- WELL, I ADORE ADORE.
SHE'S KIND OF LIKE
A DAUGHTER I WANT TO SLAP.
- [LAUGHS]
- SHE WAS KIND OF ILL-PREPARED,
BUT SHE WAS GOOD.
- RIGHT.
- THE "BITCHING," SHE GETS IT.
AND I THINK WHEN SHE DOES
NURTURE HER INNER TALENT,
SHE'S GOING TO BE UNSTOPPABLE.
- YEAH, BUT THAT
MIGHT BE TOO LATE.
NEXT, BENDELACREME.
- THIS IS ANOTHER ONE
WHO'S A STAR.
- SHE WAS INCREDIBLE.
IF DELA HAD BEEN
ON THE WINNING TEAM,
SHE PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN
THE WINNER
OF THIS WEEK'S CHALLENGE.
- YEAH.
ALL RIGHT, MOVING ON.
VIVACIOUS.
- THAT LOOK WAS DATED.
I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF IT EVEN
READS LIKE BEING FEMININE.
- UNFORTUNATELY,
SHE DIDN'T BRING IT ON.
TO BE A TALKING HEAD,
YOU GOT TO LET IT OUT,
EVEN IF YOU'RE JUST...
GIVING HEAD.
- [LAUGHS]
- BUT I DO GIVE HER CREDIT
FOR STAYING TRUE TO WHO SHE IS.
- THAT CAN BE A HINDRANCE IF
YOU REFUSE TO MOVE BEYOND THAT.
- I BEG TO DIFFER.
SHE LOOKED SAD
BECAUSE SHE FELT INFERIOR.
- AND THEN WHEN SHE LAUGHED...
[ALL SPEAKING AT ONCE]
- SILENCE!
I'VE MADE MY DECISION.
BRING BACK...
MY GIRLS.
AHH.
[LAUGHING]
- [LAUGHING]
WELCOME BACK, LADIES.
I'VE MADE SOME DECISIONS.
BENDELACREME...
YOU'RE SAFE.
- THANK YOU.
- VIVACIOUS,
CONCERNING YOUR HEAD,
I'M AFRAID THERE HAVE BEEN
SOME COMPLAINTS.
I'M SORRY, MY DEAR,
BUT YOU'RE UP FOR ELIMINATION.
LAGANJA ESTRANJA...
YOU'RE SAFE.
GIA GUNN...
YOU'RE SAFE.
ADORE DELANO...
YOU'VE GOT REAL TALENT...
BUT DO YOU HAVE
THE DISCIPLINE IT TAKES
TO GO ALL THE WAY?
APRIL CARRION...
I HATE TO RAIN ON YOUR PARADE,
BUT YOUR SCREEN TEST
WAS A WASHOUT.
ADORE DELANO...
YOU'RE SAFE.
APRIL, MY DEAR, I'M SORRY,
BUT YOU ARE UP FOR ELIMINATION.
TWO QUEENS STAND BEFORE ME.
LADIES,
THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE
TO IMPRESS ME
AND SAVE YOURSELF
FROM ELIMINATION.
THE TIME HAS COME...
FOR YOU TO LIP-SYNC...
FOR YOUR LIFE.
GOOD LUCK...
AND DON'T FUCK IT UP.
- VIVACIOUS IS WORKING ME OUT.
HER STYLE OF DRAG
IS SOMETHING THAT I ADORE.
- APRIL LOOKS LIKE SELENA GOMEZ
IS RIGHT THERE ON THAT STAGE.
VIVACIOUS IS NOT MISSING A BEAT.
SHE IS OWNING THAT STAGE.
AT THIS POINT,
IT IS TOO CLOSE TO CALL.
[APPLAUSE]
- LADIES...
I'VE MADE MY DECISION.
APRIL CARRION,
SHANTE, YOU STAY.
- THANK YOU.
- YOU MAY JOIN THE OTHER GIRLS.
VIVACIOUS...
WE LOVE YOU.
KEEP GIVING THEM LIFE, MAMA!
NOW, SASHAY AWAY.
[APPLAUSE]
- WHAT I DO, SOME
MIGHT CONSIDER A DYING ART,
AND LOOK-WISE
I MAY HAVE BEEN MISUNDERSTOOD
BY SOME OF THE QUEENS,
BUT THIS IS MY WAY OF PRESERVING
THE LEGACY OF WHERE I CAME FROM.
RU, MOTHER, THANK YOU FOREVER.
- CONDRAGULATIONS,
MY KILLER QUEENS.
NOW, REMEMBER, IF YOU CAN'T
LOVE YOURSELF, HOW IN THE...
[DISTORTED VOICE]
HELL...
[NORMAL VOICE]
YOU GONNA LOVE SOMEBODY ELSE?
CAN I GET A "AMEN" IN HERE?
- AMEN!
- ALL RIGHT, LET THE MUSIC PLAY!{\an8}[RuPaul] <i>Previously...</i>
{\an8}For this week's maxi-challenge,
you will prance your padded asses off.
{\an8}-So are you guys good dancers?
-No.
{\an8}-I'm not.
-You look like you're a little worried.
{\an8}-Maybe a little more graceful.
-Ah!
{\an8}[Carson] <i>Your tango was very correct.</i>
Katya and Violet.
Condragulations,
you're winners of the challenge.
[Katya] Oh, my God!
Ginger Minj. Shantay, you stay.
Trixie Mattel, sashay away.
{\an8}Son of a bitch, girl.
{\an8}Ugh. "Stay plastic, Trixie Mattel.
{\an8}P.S. Spoiler alert:
Trixie doesn't win. LOL."
{\an8}Oh, God.
{\an8}It really hits home
when I see Trixie's message.
{\an8}<i>I'm sad that she's the one</i>
<i>that I had to send home,</i>
{\an8}but I'm happy that I'm still here.
{\an8}But enough of this sad shit.
Congratulations to our winners.
-[Pearl] Yes!
-[Katya] Yes.
-[Ginger] You seemed surprised, Katya.
-I didn't know what happened.
-[Violet] We worked our asses off.
-[Katya] We worked really hard.
And I'm so proud of us.
Does being the only one
who has not had to lip-sync scare you?
Do y'all think my time is coming?
{\an8}I just want to see you lip-sync,
'cause I haven't seen it this season.
{\an8}Really, girl?
[Violet] How does it feel
to have a weakness?
I feel you've been strong
this entire competition,
but I feel like I've really got to see
your weakness this week.
I've got plenty of weaknesses.
What you don't see is when I go home,
I sob like a fucking baby,
and I come back in with my game face on.
-Never let 'em see you sweat.
-That's what the competition is about.
And don't rest on your laurels, bitch.
Because we all know that with only
one thread hanging, your ass is packing.
-Because there's how many now?
-Five!
[RuPaul] <i>The winner receives a year supply</i>
<i>of Anastasia Beverly Hills cosmetics</i>
<i>and a cash prize of $100,000.</i>
<i>With our extra special guest judges,</i>
<i>shake the dice, Santino Rice,</i>
<i>and Rebecca Romijn.</i>
[electronic music playing]
-[Pearl] Let's do this.
-[Katya] Ooh...
The old lady brigade has made it.
Can we hear it for senility?
{\an8}Top five. You can count 'em on one hand,
and I'm one of them.
This one.
You came in
in this whole Russian doll thing.
I thought you were from Russia.
I was like, "They flew this bitch in?"
Most people who come to my show
don't know that I'm not Russian,
'cause I talk in this Russian accent.
Does anybody else do
other languages, accents or anything?
No, I can barely speak fucking English.
-[alarm sounds]
-Here we go, honey.
[RuPaul] <i>She done</i>
<i>already done had herses!</i>
-<i>Hey, queens</i>.
-Hey.
<i>From Tuckahoe to Tokyo, whether you're</i>
<i>a couture queen or somebody's BFF,</i>
<i>make sure you stand by your brand.</i>
Konnichiwa<i>, bitches.</i>
[laughter]
-Hello, hello, hello.
-[all] Hi!
Come through, ruffles.
[RuPaul] Ladies, at this point
in the competition,
you probably know what the other queens
are gonna say before they do.
So for today's mini-challenge,
it's your chance to prove it...
with puppets!
-Because why?
-[all] Because everybody loves puppets.
See?
Pick a puppet that represents
one of your competitors and drag it up.
All right. First up, Katya.
Step over to the gloryhole-elujah.
Dig deep for a puppet.
-Who'd you get?
-Ginger Minj.
All right. Next up, Ginger Minj.
Don't be scurred.
-Violet.
-Bitch, my hair is layered.
I don't know what they're talking about.
-[RuPaul] Pearl.
-[Pearl] There's something slimy in there.
[Pearl] Yes!
All right, Kennedy. You're up.
All right, Violet.
Get over there and stick it in the hole.
[laughter]
I don't have that much hair.
All right.
It's time to drag up your puppet
using supplies
from the Fabric Planet wall.
Go!
[electronic music playing]
Can I borrow one of your regular outfits?
I think it'll fit this doll.
-Try making something.
-I'll learn sewing when you learn acting.
Done.
The key to capturing my essence
is capturing my scent visually.
[RuPaul] Time's up.
All right, ladies.
Let the bitch-fest begin.
Hi, Kennedy. Start by telling us
where you got this inspiration from.
Girl, this is what happens
when a bad trick goes wrong.
He threw me into the embers
where I arose as a phoenix.
What was that look?
<i>It's gonna go down in history</i>
<i>as the deranged Tony the Tiger.</i>
Hi, everybody.
I want you to meet my girlfriend, Pearl.
Why don't you have any titty pants on?
I mean...
This is how we do it in New York.
-Does her mouth move at all?
-Oh, look at me.
[Kennedy] I love it.
I don't have to wear pants.
-Yes, you do, miss thing. This is drag.
-I mean...
-[snoring]
-[Kennedy] Miss Pearl.
Miss Pearl!
Miss thing!
{\an8}These bitches need some new material.
I woke up a long time ago, goddamn it.
-Oh, wow, and who do we have here?
-That looks just like me.
-Hi, I'm Katya Slobonanobblebitch.
-Is that Russian? Are you from Russia?
No.
Go you, Katya.
I can't wait to see more from you.
Yeah, I can't wait too.
I'm gonna go smoke something.
Meth.
-Hi. What's your name?
-Ginger Minj, from Leesburg, Florida.
About three minutes north of Gatorland,
which is where I learned to do my makeup.
Wow! So alligators
taught you how to do your makeup?
I spray my forehead black, let it
drip down and blend that into my cheeks.
Wow. That's revolutionary.
Your name, Violet Chachki, is interesting.
Where does that come from?
I wanted to figure out what was beautiful
and completely worthless.
A tchotchke!
I'm trying to train myself
with this corset.
I'm really trying to get down to 2 inches.
-Why haven't you gotten there yet?
-Your wrist is fat and shoved inside me.
I'll never get down to 2 inches.
-And scene.
-Oh, my God!
Ooh, y'all some shady ass ladies.
But one of you
was quite the puppet master.
The winner of today's mini-challenge is...
Ginger Minj!
Ah! I take credit.
I'll post all the best bitch-fest moments
at logotv.com.
Ladies, America's next drag superstar
needs to know how to brand her charisma,
uniqueness, nerve and talent.
For inspiration, you'll be joining forces
with a global marketing phenomenon
-worth over $8 billion.
-Is that a real number?
A girl who's besties with Miley Cyrus,
Lady Gaga, and Nicki Minaj,
and has her own line of makeup,
jewelry, dolls.
Ladies, please give
a big drag-race welcome to...
Hello Kitty!
Hey, Kitty Girl. Come on down here.
<i>Konnichiwa</i>, bitches.
-Oh, my God.
-Hi!
It's so great to have you on the show.
For this week's maxi-challenge,
you'll be designing and creating
your very own runway eleganza,
{\an8}using products provided
by Hello Kitty herself, #HelloKittyGirl.
Although your dress
will be made with Hello Kitty items,
the final look needs to scream you.
Now, Ginger Minj, you won the bitch-fest.
So you get a head start
on grabbing all the goodies.
-Are you ready?
-I'm ready.
-Go!
-Ooh!
I don't know what I'm gonna make
because I'm not a costume designer.
So I just start grabbing
whatever I can find.
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.
Let's go this way, darling.
[electronic music playing]
I have had my fill
of these damn design challenges.
Please don't make me sew again.
This is the part of <i>Drag Race</i>
I don't like.
Kennedy's stressed about this challenge.
Katya seems stressed about this challenge.
These bitter old ladies
got a lot of work cut out for them.
Take your Metamucil, girls.
This is gonna be a rough one.
[electronic music playing]
Ugh!
{\an8}We have to create a couture look
entirely out of Hello Kitty materials.
I'm all about having concepts
and having them executed flawlessly.
I'm excited to do this fucking challenge.
You have no idea.
I'll do black and pink, and then do
my thigh boots and juice them up
with my fishnets
and give that kind of look.
{\an8}I want to make it look sexy,
like, Becky, who's 21 years old
{\an8}with a hot boyfriend
and who have a fetish for Hello Kitty.
-What's your plan?
-I don't know.
I'm into period looks,
and I haven't done a '60s thing yet.
-Oh.
-So I want to go, like, mod.
-What about you?
-I don't know. I have no fucking idea.
I could use this to shield
the judges from my horrible outfit.
-Like really fierce.
-Oh, my God. How avant-garde is that?
-It looks so great from the side...
-Yes, Gaga, come through.
Lady Gaga, you look amazing.
Work! Oh, it's Katya.
-We'll get some inspo.
-I'm working on it.
-Maybe I can help.
-Don't pressure me!
Katya has relied on humor her whole life.
Presenting a fashion thing is a struggle.
She has so much talent,
and I just wish she would focus.
-You have something I don't have.
-Beauty?
You have this hairy mole on your back.
No, you have this unshakeable confidence.
-I so admire that.
-Thank you.
Drag is all about confidence, I feel.
That's why I like it.
{\an8}I'm gonna try to absorb
a bit of Violet's confidence.
This is my confident face.
[hinges squeak]
-Hello, hello, hello. Look who's back.
-[all] Hi!
-[Violet] Oh, my God!
-[Kennedy] Oh, my goodness!
It's Santino. He's here to help you
with your Hello Kitty eleganza.
Santino Rice walks through that door,
and I flood my basement, bitch.
That is one sexy man.
Newark. LaGuardia. Kennedy.
This looks gorgeous, these little bows.
-I'm accessorizing with the bows.
-Uh-huh.
I'm dying that their bows are gone.
-I want to know what's Kennedy's style.
-Kennedy is a catsuit queen.
-I'm an entertainer. I dance, so...
-Yeah.
-Do you know how to make a catsuit?
-No.
Oh. Okay.
Like somebody who love enchiladas
but don't know how to make 'em.
In my head I'm like, "I am not creative,
but what do you want to do?"
You are creative. That's why you're here.
So let's see something.
Get back to work. I cannot wait
to see what you come up with.
Thank you very much.
-Violet Chachki.
-Hi, RuPaul.
-Hi. Meet Santino.
-Hi, Santino.
-Hey, how are you?
-You look so dapper.
Thank you.
Now, I wanted you to meet Santino
because he also studied fashion,
knew all of the silhouettes.
-Do you have any questions for Santino?
-Can we go to Red Lobster?
I want to do something kind of...
bubblegum pop mod meets Harajuku.
Everything you described to us
is really incredible.
This boning you're using,
that's for your head?
[RuPaul] Oh, my goodness. Wow.
Violet looks like the human gaydar, bitch.
What the hell?
Now, you've set the standard really high.
-Let's see something amazing out of you.
-I will do my very best.
All right, get to work,
and we'll see you out there.
-Hi, Katya.
-Hi.
You won the challenge last week.
How will you keep the momentum going?
I'm just-- I don't know.
I have no idea what I'm doing.
If you start doing something,
it will lead you to where you need to be.
But if it stays in your head,
you're not gonna get out of the gate.
I would say first and foremost,
if you can somehow incorporate Hello Kitty
into who Katya is,
you're gonna be all right.
-Listen. The clock is running out. Okay?
-Make it work.
I don't want to fuck up this challenge,
and I have no idea what I'm gonna do.
-Hey, Pearl.
-Hi, RuPaul. Hi, Santino.
-So, <i>flazéda</i>.
-<i>Flazéda</i>. It's the new hashtag.
-It's spreading like wildfire.
-It sure is. It's all the rage.
-Did you make that up?
-I guess so. I thought it was a real word.
-Maybe I thought of it in a dream.
-Yeah.
Just because you dreamt it
doesn't make it any less real, Pearl.
What can Pearl bring to this challenge?
Maybe some sort of pooled skirt,
maybe even like a hobble dress.
-[RuPaul] Very <i>flazéda</i>.
-Very that.
-The skirt's gonna be out of this blanket?
-This plush, yeah.
{\an8}I'm interested to see
how Pearl's gonna do with this,
{\an8}because she is always long,
drapey and flowing.
None of this fabric
is particularly long, drapey, or flowing.
Hello Kitty, good-bye, Pearl.
-Ginger Minj.
-Hi.
You don't sew?
-No. I don't.
-How far along are you in this?
-I cut out this panel so far.
-That can be a problem, Ginger.
-You've been in the bottom two twice.
-And both of those design challenges.
Do you have
a foundation garment that you wear?
I have shorts with the hips
and the ass built into them.
-And you cinch your waist or...
-I don't.
When I first started drag,
my drag mother said to me,
"It looks stupid when big girls corset
and got stuff bubbling here and there."
If you make something for your body,
it will accentuate the positives
and eliminate the negatives.
I would really encourage you
to cinch in your shape a little bit.
You look a little defeated here.
-I'm trying to figure out my next move.
-Well, we're running out of time here.
So get to work and let those juices flow.
I want to crawl underneath
the workstation and fucking die.
All right, ladies, gather around.
Tomorrow, Santino will be back
on the judges' panel to let you have it.
So good luck, and don't...
Wait a minute, wait.
I almost forgot.
There's one more thing.
Oh, pit crew!
[gasps]
[RuPaul] In addition
to your Hello Kitty eleganza,
you need to create a second look.
That's right, you need
to turn yourself into a character
that Hello Kitty would be proud
to call her new BFF.
And by all means, help yourself
to supplies from the Fabric Planet wall.
[Katya] <i>I don't have a first outfit,</i>
and I have to make
a new character and outfit to go with it.
Ah... Fucking fuck.
-Good luck, and...
-[both] Don't fuck it up.
I want to throw my hands up in the air
and say,
"It's been real, y'all.
Peace. I'll see you at the reunion."
[electronic music playing]
{\an8}Ugh! So now there's a twist.
<i>Not only do we have to create</i>
<i>a Hello Kitty-inspired look for ourselves,</i>
we have to create
an entirely new Hello Kitty character.
Ugh...
-[Violet] These aren't easy to see out of.
-[Pearl] You can't see?
-[Ginger] I can't see.
-[Violet] You can't see shit.
-[Pearl] Is this a joke?
-[Violet] We have to walk like this.
[Ginger] How? Oh, my God.
{\an8}It's really impossible
to try to serve face in this head.
What kind of nose
does a cow have?
Like a snout.
{\an8}I don't know
how the hell I'm gonna pull this off.
[electronic music playing]
Oh, my gosh. Okay. So...
I don't I have my first outfit,
and I have to make
a new character and outfit to go with it,
and I have no idea what it is.
[Pearl] Ah! Oh, my God.
-How does this look?
-Gorgeous.
-How you doing over there, Katya?
-[Katya] Ugh...
I'm okay.
The other girls have no idea
what's happening in my mind right now
because I am a master
of hiding my turbulent emotions,
but I am flipping the fuck out.
I just feel like I'm fucked.
{\an8}-[Ginger] Ouch!
-[Kennedy]  Girl...
{\an8}Kennedy] Don't be pushin' on me.
I'ma tell!
I feel pretty good.
I'm pleased with my look so much.
I think it's flawless.
How's yours coming, Katya?
Um, well...
I think in the pantheon
of bad decision-making...
I think my runway outfit is like...
-The one?
-The one.
Commit to your look.
Yesterday, I had a total panic attack,
but last night I started working
on my Hello Kitty BFF character,
and I love what I'm coming up with,
but I have to finish my main stage outfit,
and I have like, no time.
I need another cat head.
I love makeup, but we're not all
legendary makeup artists like you, Pearl.
-No, I'm not.
-You're known for your makeup.
{\an8}I've been drawing Pearl since I was ten.
Pearl was a character I would draw 'cause
it distracted me from the horrible things
that I felt were going on around me.
<i>As I got older</i>
<i>and started to realize I was gay,</i>
I just realized that all the things I love
when you boil it down, it's drag.
And then one day just...
painted her on me instead of the paper.
[Violet] You're so <i>flazéda</i>, Pearl.
My makeup today's gonna be <i>flazéda</i>.
I'm gonna channel that.
Fuck. Right. Off.
["Cover Girl" playing]
[RuPaul laughs]
Welcome to the main stage
of <i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i>.
Michelle Visage. Hey, Kitty Girl.
{\an8}Well, Harajuku to you too.
{\an8}A real cool cat, Carson Kressley.
{\an8}Well, hello. <i>Konnichiwa</i>.
<i>Domo arigato</i>, hairy asshole.
{\an8}Shake the dice and steal the fried rice.
It's Santino.
{\an8}<i>Kawaii</i>, Ru.
And my BFF, from <i>Skin Wars</i>,
the ravishing Rebecca Romijn.
{\an8}-[speaking Japanese]
-What's new, Pussycat?
Oh, you know.
I'm ready for a pussy party.
Oh, we're in some big trouble tonight.
This week, we challenged our queens
to transform Hello Kitty swag
into drop-dead gorgeous drag.
But first, they're making
their runway debut
as Hello Kitty's newest BFFs.
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.
Tonight, we have an extra special guest.
It's Hello Kitty!
["Cover Girl" playing]
Oh, my God! She's coming for me!
-[Carson] I love her bloomers.
-[Michelle] Her little knickers.
Wait, what the fuck
did you just call me?
[RuPaul] Category is...
{\an8}Hello Kitty BFF Realness.
{\an8}-[RuPaul] First up, Hello Violet.
-[Michelle] She's got a mirror and a afro.
{\an8}[Rebecca] Perfectly purrty.
[Violet] <i>Hi. My name is Hello Violet,</i>
<i>and I'm Hello Kitty's new BFF.</i>
<i>My nickname is Lavender Trinket.</i>
<i>Everyone loves my honesty and my shoes.</i>
<i>One special thing to know about me</i>
<i>is that I love to look in the mirror.</i>
<i>I dream of one day becoming a fairy</i>
<i>or maybe even a model.</i>
<i>That's why Hello Kitty and I</i>
<i>will be the best frenemies forever.</i>
[laughter]
[RuPaul] Bye-ee!
{\an8}[RuPaul] Hello Ginger. Holy cow!
{\an8}[laughter]
[Ginger] <i>Hi, y'all.</i>
<i>My nickname is The Country Cow.</i>
<i>My utterly charming personality</i>
<i>makes people smile.</i>
<i>And everyone loves my milkshake.</i>
<i>Hello Kitty and I love to chew cud</i>
<i>together and play Moo-nopoly.</i>
<i>I dream of one day becoming</i>
<i>a designer handbag,</i>
<i>or maybe even a filet mignon.</i>
[laughter]
[RuPaul] Oh, she was so moo-ving.
{\an8}-[RuPaul] Hello Pearl.
-[Michelle] Madonna, is that you?
{\an8}[Pearl] <i>I am Hello Kitty's new BFF.</i>
<i>My nickname is Banji Beatdown.</i>
<i>And I'm from the magic land of Brooklyn.</i>
<i>I dream of becoming a nail technician</i>
<i>or maybe even a rocket scientist.</i>
<i>My ratchet personality makes people smile</i>
<i>and everyone loves my brass knuckles.</i>
<i>That's why Hello Kitty and I</i>
<i>will be the best felons forever.</i>
[laughter]
-[RuPaul] Hello Kitty, stay away from her.
-[Michelle] She's trouble.
{\an8}[RuPaul] Hello Katya.
{\an8}[Carson] She's Putin her money
where her mouth is.
[Katya] Privyet<i>. My name is Hello Katya,</i>
<i>and I'm from the magic land of Siberia.</i>
<i>And everyone loves my bad breath.</i>
<i>One extra special thing about me is</i>
<i>I'm the sweatiest woman in show business.</i>
<i>I feel my socialist side will balance out</i>
<i>Hello Kitty's decadent capitalism.</i>
<i>That's why Hello Kitty and I</i>
<i>will be best comrades forever.</i>
[RuPaul] She's not Russian.
She's taking her time.
{\an8}[RuPaul] Hello Kennedy.
{\an8}-[RuPaul] Oh, yeah! Tap that weave.
-[Santino] Pat, pat yo weave.
[Kennedy] <i>I'm Hello Kitty's new BFF.</i>
<i>My nickname is Sweet Hips.</i>
<i>I'm going to serve the runway,</i>
<i>so watch out!</i>
<i>Hello Kitty and I love to fry chicken</i>
<i>and play on the monkey bars.</i>
<i>That's why Hello Kitty and I</i>
<i>will be the best judies forever!</i>
[RuPaul] Girl, yeah.
You got to move all of that.
[RuPaul] Kittygory is...
{\an8}Hello Kitty Eleganza.
{\an8}First up, Violet Chachki.
{\an8}Yes, she must've liked it,
'cause she put a ring on it.
[laughter]
[Violet] <i>I'm giving you</i>
<i>the '60s Harajuku Barbarella space cadet.</i>
<i>There's a lot happening,</i>
<i>but it looks chic.</i>
[RuPaul] I know
why the caged queen stomps.
[laughter]
{\an8}-[RuPaul] Ginger Minj.
-[Michelle] Hello, Titty.
{\an8}[Carson] Yes, pussies galore.
[Ginger] <i>I am walking down this runway,</i>
<i>showing them that I am pure pussy</i>
<i>with all of these kitty cats, honey.</i>
[Rebecca] She's a crazy cat lady
saying, "Check me out."
[Santino] What does
her apartment smell like?
{\an8}[RuPaul] Next up, Pearl.
She's got a lot on her mind.
{\an8}[laughter]
-[Rebecca] She's a tall kitty.
-[Pearl]<i> I love the shape of my dress.</i>
<i>It's a perfect combination</i>
<i>of cheesy little girl</i>
<i>and something totally grown-up</i>
<i>that can be photographed for a magazine.</i>
[RuPaul] She woke up like that.
Actually, she literally slept in that.
[laughter]
{\an8}-[RuPaul] Katya.
-[Carson] It's a catsuit.
{\an8}-[Carson] Duh.
-[Michelle] It's a catsuit.
[Katya] <i>I'm giving you '60s housewife</i>
<i>as a stuntwoman.</i>
<i>Maybe in space.</i>
<i>Could be an aerobics teacher.</i>
<i>I'm owning this batshit crazy look,</i>
<i>and I'm just trying to sell it.</i>
[RuPaul] That's what I call
a puss in boots.
[laughter]
{\an8}[RuPaul] Newark. LaGuardia. Kennedy.
She's serving a little Eartha Kitt.
-[Rebecca] Eartha Kitty.
-[Michelle] That is one giant puss.
[Kennedy] <i>I am advertising</i>
<i>for Hello Kitty, honey.</i>
<i>Flipping my hair</i>
<i>so they can see the detail in the back.</i>
-[Kennedy] <i>Just feeling fish.</i>
-[RuPaul] Are those kneepads?
[Rebecca] She's ready
for the Hello Kitty Ho Stroll.
[laughter]
Hello, my pretty kitties.
It's time for the judges' critiques.
First up, Violet Chachki.
Let's talk about your BFF.
She was super fun, still vain.
-I think you did a good job tonight.
-I love this look.
-[Rebecca] I'm having waist envy.
-It's Barbarella. It's beautiful.
What I love most about it
is it's different for Violet Chachki.
Thank you so much.
Next up, Ginger Minj.
I love what you did with your BFF.
I loved your voice-over.
For me, where this fell short...
It's just a tiny bit too literal.
I love it. It's fun.
You look like a basketful of kitties.
It's like you're overflowing with kitties.
If you bent over, more kitties would fall.
[laughter]
Ginger's having a problem
with a fucking horsefly that's landing...
It's so great to actually be here.
-[Violet] Got it.
-[RuPaul] She got it.
[RuPaul] It's right there.
Thank you, Ginger.
Next up, Pearl.
The easiest way to my heart
is to pull a Madonna out of your pocket
and basically
that's what I got with your BFF.
[Carson] But like, if Madonna
and a marshmallow had a baby.
-Sounds delicious.
-[Carson] It does, doesn't it?
The first thing that comes to mind
when I see your outfit
is when Giorgio di Sant'Angelo
went into the desert with Veruschka.
All he did was wrap blankets around her
and gave really beautiful face.
-That's what I was actually going for.
-Really?
-What was the toughest part of this?
-My looks are very minimal.
I just didn't want to throw
a bunch of Hello Kitty trinkets on me
to get the point across, so...
-Was that a read?
-Yes, it was.
-Thank you, Pearl.
-Thank you.
-Next up, Katya.
-<i>Privyet</i>.
For your BFF, loved your voice-over.
I loved that you added
some international flavor to the Meow Mix.
Then we have the look, the eleganza.
I'm a bit confused by it
because the hair to me
doesn't go with the outfit.
You're giving us hot futuristic
space mom who loves Hello Kitty.
[laughter]
-Was that it?
-Get out of my head.
So, 1960s stuntwoman
coerced into prostitution
on her way to fashion week in Chernobyl.
You could've taken it even further,
gotten your point of view across better.
Thank you, Katya.
Next up, Newark. LaGuardia.
Kennedy Davenport.
On the runway, it's a miss for me.
It's basic what you did on the bodysuit.
[Santino] To cut out all these bows
and then sew them on in rows.
I thought you were doing
an amazing flourish.
The challenge was to stick
to who we are, and this is me.
It could be a bit more adventuresome
for you to try some more daring looks.
That transferred over to your BFF.
It was a little bit sassy.
-But it wasn't enough for me.
-What kept you from going further with it?
I wish I had
some creativity like these ladies.
Actually, you do.
And that's why it's strange for us.
Because we see you in a way
that you're clearly not seeing yourself.
Well, thank you, ladies.
While you go untuck backstage,
the judges and I will deliberate.
For tonight's deliberation,
we have an extra special guest.
Just between us kitty girls,
what do you think?
Let's start with Violet Chachki.
Her Hello Violet character
was more tame than her extravaganza look.
I actually appreciated that she was
a little tame on her Hello Violet
because you are dealing
with such an iconic brand like that.
Her Hello Kitty couture was fabulous.
She really delivers what we've asked for.
She has a great eye for proportion.
Violet's a creative powerhouse.
She has a million silhouettes in her head,
and she's brought it to us every time.
-Why are you gagging so?
-She bring it to you, every ball.
-[RuPaul] <i>Ginger Minj.</i>
-Her BFF look was amazing.
She's very detail-oriented.
I don't have any beefs with this look.
It really moo-ved me.
It worked beautifully with the brand.
That being said, I was not blown away
by the Hello Kitty couture.
I would've liked to have seen
some more whimsicality.
How could she be more whimsical?
She had hair, ears,
<i>a bow in her head,</i>
<i>stuffed animals on her boobs.</i>
-That's not whimsical enough?
-Are we talking about Ginger or you?
[RuPaul] <i>Pearl.</i>
She created for her couture look
a glamorous, dramatic, plushy character.
It's a wraparound blanket.
Only somebody who weighs
82 pounds wet could pull that look off,
where you could wear a blanket
and call it a dress.
<i>Hello Kitty BFF.</i>
<i>The Madonna vibe made me so happy.</i>
She was having fun,
which is a really big deal for Pearl,
who always looks like she's half-asleep.
-But Kitty wouldn't hang out with her.
-And shoplift.
So, Hello Kitty,
would you hang out with Hello Pearl?
[RuPaul] No, no...
[RuPaul] <i>Katya.</i>
I loved her Hello Kitty BFF.
It was so wrong, it was strong.
It was hilarious and irreverent,
and I think drag should do that.
There's no way Hello Kitty's allowed
to hang out with this Russian hooker.
Hello Kitty, would you hang out
with an older Russian woman
who smokes cigarettes from Siberia?
[Santino] Oh. Oh, wow. Maybe. Huh.
The eleganza. I didn't like it at all.
None of it went together.
I actually get what she was going for
with the hairdo and the pearls.
I thought it looked like futuristic,
like, Jetsons.
[RuPaul] Kennedy Davenport.
Her character, it never delivered.
She had an idea that just fizzled.
Her look was a basic ho-stroll outfit.
She just glued bows and pincushions.
You're gonna mutilate a hundred
Hello Kitty dolls and take their bows off,
and you're gonna use them like that?
No, you're not.
Ask Hello Kitty what she thought about
how she used all those bows.
Silence!
I've made my decision.
Bring back my litter.
Welcome back, ladies.
Based on your Hello Kitty presentations,
I've made some decisions.
Pearl...
you're safe.
Kennedy Davenport,
your round-the-way girl
could've used more twirl.
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
Violet Chachki. This week,
you were a real glamor-puss.
Condragulations,
you are the winner of this challenge.
You've won
a Hello Kitty extravaganza package,
featuring accessories
to add Hello Kitty realness to your life.
Thank God.
{\an8}I'm the winner,
and I feel it was well goddamn deserved.
Ginger Minj, you grabbed
a hold of this challenge and milked it
for all it was worth.
You're safe.
Katya, I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
Two queens stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me and save yourself
from elimination.
-The time has come...
-[thunder clap]
...for you to lip-sync...
...for your life!
{\an8}I want to perform
the shit out of this number.
<i>I want to be in the top four so badly.</i>
Good luck, and don't fuck it up.
{\an8}[Katy Perry's "Roar" playing]
[RuPaul shouts]
[cheers and laughter]
[Violet] Yes! Come through!
Wow!
Ladies, I've made my decision.
Kennedy Davenport, shantay, you stay.
-Bitches better beware.
-Thank you.
-You may join the other girls.
-Thank you.
Katya, you may doubt yourself sometimes,
but I have no doubt that you are a star.
And a hammer. And a sickle.
Now, sashay away.
I don't know all the words to express
how insanely fucking grateful I am.
{\an8}[in Russian]
Thank you very much. I love you so much.
[cheers]
[Katya]<i> I don't want to go home,</i>
<i>but I don't have any regrets.</i>
Regret is a dish best served cold.
No, that's revenge. Fuck.
Please stay tuned for my one-woman show,
<i>Love Stories from My Vagina</i>.
[in Russian]
<i>I forgot that only birds have wings.</i>
<i>That means my diaphragm just fell out.</i>
<i>Will you pick it up for me?</i>
[in Russian] See you.
Ladies, you are the best of the best.
{\an8}My final four queens.
{\an8}Remember, if you can't love yourself,
how are you gonna love somebody else?
{\an8}-Can I get an amen up in here?
-[all] Amen!
{\an8}All right. Now, let the music play.
{\an8}[RuPaul] Bye-ee!


{\an8}<i>Previously on "RuPaul's Drag Race"...</i>
{\an8}You'll be creating your own
punny-or-die music video.
{\an8}Cut. Trixie, why do you keep walking
in and out of the shot?
{\an8}RuPaul and Michelle Visage think we're
a bunch of disorganized fuck-tards.
Trixie, you are not standing out for me.
Pearl, come out of your shell.
I feel picked on, almost.
Kennedy Davenport, you are
the winner of this week's challenge.
Pearl, shantay, you stay.
Trixie Mattel, sashay away.
{\an8}-Girl. Long day.
-Oh, my God, I have been through it today.
{\an8}I am in complete shock. Trixie should be
here. This is a fucking travesty.
{\an8}Pearl, do you think the
judges' critiques were fair tonight?
{\an8}I'm really just kind of over the judges.
I thought I gave great energy.
{\an8}Back home, everybody loves me.
<i>At first, I thought I was so sickening,</i>
<i>everyone would just be obsessed with me,</i>
but obviously that's not the case.
Good riddance to this fucking day.
-I didn't expect it to be Trixie.
-I gagged. I truly gagged.
{\an8}The vibe around the workroom
 is a little bit shocked.
This may sound like old lady bullshit
but after trying for this for seven years
and someone says, "fuck this,"
that pisses me off.
Yeah.
Pearl, I'm sorry you didn't like
your criticisms, but buck up, buttercup.
<i>Be grateful for the opportunity</i>
<i>that you have. Otherwise...</i>
leave.
[car engine revving up]
The winner receives a year's supply
of Anastasia Beverly Hills Cosmetics,
and a cash price of $100,000.
With our extra special
guest judge, Isaac Mizrahi.
[car braking]
[giggling]
Go. Go. Go.
What is wrong with y'all?
{\an8}It is a new day in the workroom.
I'm excited.
<i>Last week, I was safe. </i>
<i>I didn't come here to play it safe.</i>
That ain't cute. At all.
-You look like a boy scout.
-Oh, me?
-I like it.
-Give him a pet name.
-Let's call her Scout.
-Well, God, what are we?
I would say Cardiac Arrest.
[laughter]
-Whooo.
-Uh-oh.
Oh, shit.
-Here we go.
<i>-She done already done had herses.</i>
<i>For your consideration, whether</i>
<i>you're snatching wigs or trophies,</i>
<i>like this Marquette by Tweeterhead,</i>
<i>available online.</i>
<i>You better have one huge pair of</i>
<i>Golden Globes. Hope you win. Mean it!</i>
-[car revving]
-[laughter]
-Hello, hello, hello.
-Hello.
Hi.
You know Drag Race viewers create
the most twisted fan art in the world.
One super fan blew everyone away
{\an8}by recreating our queens'
hottest looks using only... paper.
Yeah. Paper.
For today's Mini-Challenge,
you'll be making your own paper versions
of classic celebrity red carpet outfits.
Now, you'll be working in pairs.
So based on how you lined up this morning,
teams are: Ginger Minj and Kandy Ho.
-Lil' Kim.
-Yay.
Jaidynn Diore Fierce and
Kennedy Davenport, Lady Gaga. [gasps]
-Pearl and Max, Cher.
-Ooh.
Mrs. Kasha Davis and Katya, Björk.
And Violet Chachki and Miss Fame,
Jennifer Lopez.
{\an8}I'm paired up with Violet
and I'm the glass half-full.
She's like the empty beer bottle
that you find, like, next to the chair.
Oh, pit crew!
[RuPaul laughs]
I see the morning paper has arrived.
[laughter] Ooooh.
Oh, read all about it.
This is gonna be the best game
of frock, paper, scissors ever.
Go!
-Good?
-Yeah.
Hurry up, bitch. Tape this shit.
-You don't have to fucking slap me.
-If I get the chance.
All right, time's up, ladies.
First up...
[laughter]
{\an8}Ginger Minj and Kandy Ho.
Look at Lil' Kim.
{\an8}<i>It's from the line, I don't give a tit.</i>
Whomp, whomp.  I had
to do that. [laughter]
{\an8}Next up, Jaidynn Diore Fierce and
Kennedy Davenport, Lady Gaga.
{\an8}Yes, ma'am, wet and juicy
in all the right places.
The "steaks" are high, ladies.
[laughter]
{\an8}Next up, Violet Chachki and Miss Fame.
"Jenny from the block".
{\an8}Wow, Versace.
It's actually "Versnatch".
Turn around, J-Lo, let's see the backside.
You're not Jennifer Lopez!
[laughter]
Next up, Pearl and Max.
Dark lady.
{\an8}No tramp or thief could steal
this custom couture.
Shut up, stupid.
[laughter]
Born naked and the rest is Bob Mackie.
{\an8}Next up, re-creating the
infamous swan dress, Katya.
-And... is that Joan Rivers?
-What are you wearing?
Actually, I'm wearing a custom-made
Klein Epstein &amp; Parker suit.
Stunning. And this next gal,
she's wearing a swan on her body
and a elephant on her ankles.
Now available on iTunes.
Björk flew all the way from Iceland
for this, and, boy, are her arms tired.
Yes. The rest of her looks tired, too.
Next thing, you'll look like Pearl, honey.
Good job, ladies. I've graded
your papers and the winning pair is...
Mrs. Kasha Davis and Katya.
I'm posting all of your
paper doll looks at logotv.com.
Ladies, you're all dressed up.
Now you need a place to go. Good news.
You're invited to the most prestigious
award show of the season,
girl! The first annual Despy Awards.
{\an8}#SnatchingTrophies.
{\an8}Working in your current pairs,
you'll be the presenters <i>and</i> nominees.
You'll need to come up with funny banter,
take jabs at your fellow nominees,
and if you win, you better have
an unforgettable acceptance speech.
{\an8}Jaidynn Diore Fierce and Kennedy
Davenport present "Sexy, Sexy Drag Queen."
{\an8}"Most Busted Queen,"
presented by Pearl and Max.
{\an8}"The Shadiest Queen," presented by
Ginger Minj and Kandy Ho.
{\an8}And, my favorite, "The Meatiest Tuck,"
presented by Violet Chachki and Miss Fame.
{\an8}Kasha Davis and Katya, you won the
Mini-Challenge, you're our Despy co-hosts.
{\an8}Now, to help you punch up your material,
Kathy Griffin is back.
-Yes, girl!
-Gentlemen,
start your engines
and may the best woman win.
So, Meatiest Tuck. Let's talk about that.
{\an8}Miss Fame and I sit down and start writing
jokes and neither of us are comedy queens.
[music]
With Pearl, the only thing showing
outward emotion is between her legs.
-What do you think is funny?
-I don't know.
We're both drawing a blank. You're looking
at me looking at the paper.
-The words escape me.
-My ideas are
somewhat decent, and you're like, "No."
If you think it's funny then
present it in a comical way.
{\an8}Fame and Violet, neither one of them have
really shown a whole lot of comedic value
in this competition yet. I'm interested to
see if they come up with any jokes at all.
This is stressing me out.
We've got to get it together.
I want to read everybody,
including ourselves.
{\an8}For this week's challenge, we all have to
present at an award show, The Despies.
We have to write jokes and we have to
present them live in front of an audience.
I want to win.
-So, what's our game plan?
-What you got?
You got anything?
{\an8}I know nothing about
award show stuff,
{\an8}but we're gonna sit down
and write us some jokes.
"Ladies and gentlemen, we are here to
present the Sexy, Sexy Drag Queen awards."
{\an8}I'm very confident in doing comedy.
-"And the nominees are..."
-No.
I mean, I won last week's challenge.
No. No. Uh-uh. Don't write it like that.
In that order, right here,
"Back to the nominee."
-We need a transition, then we can leave.
-Hush.
I know she's a little bit irritated.
Without saying,
I think she was saying, "Oh, I wish
I was with somebody funnier."
Okay, well, I guess I'm gonna be quiet.
-Hey, kitty girl.
-Hi.
-Are you getting excited for the Despies?
-Oh, yeah.
-Hey, girls.
-Hello, darling.
You all are opening the show,
so there's extra pressure.
-Yes.
-But you've hosted shows before.
-Yes
-Who are you patterning your banter after?
Tina Fey and Amy Poehler
hosting the Golden Globes was...
-...perfection.
-Perfection.
So, that is
what I have in my mind.
Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis come up.
She says,"Who"?
-I'm educating this youngster.
-I'm not actually that young.
-But you're just...
-I'm just ignorant.
Well, listen, you kids
have a lot of work to do.
-We're looking at your big opening.
-No pressure.
-No.
-Alright, thank you.
-Hey, kitty girl.
-Hi, Ru!
Have either of you done comedy before?
-Never.
-Do you two have banter prepared or...
What's your chemistry like?
You know what? We're two
very different people. Um...
I had to think about working with
somebody like her.
She's dark-sided.
-If you can't beat 'em, join 'em.
-We're brainstorming right now
and seeing what we can play off, you know,
and make it funny and twist it in...
a dark-sided kind of way.
Being dark-sided is one thing but being
funny is a completely different thing.
Violet and Fame...
Oh, that's gonna be a laugh riot.
-Hi.
-Hello.
-Now, you're a show host, aren't you?
-Yes, I host several shows around Orlando.
-And you? Is comedy in your background?
-If a joke comes out when I'm tipsy,
it just comes out, but
I am not, like, a funny girl.
So how are you gonna make it funny?
She'll throw shade at me
and I'll throw shade at her and...
Well, I just want to tell you, ladies,
it's important to create a moment.
That's what stands out. Think about
when Sally Fields won her second Oscar,
you don't remember anything about that
ceremony except her saying, "You like me,
-You really like me."
-Mm-hmm.
So do something special.
-Hey, ladies.
-Hello, darling.
-Hi, RuPaul.
-So, what award are you presenting?
We'll present
"Most Busted Drag Queen."
That gives us an opportunity
to be a little bit more cutting.
Great, because this is about funny banter.
We're gonna go off a subtlety thing
like, speaking just very soft and gentle,
-but very cutty.
-That's not the easiest thing to pull off.
You have a big personality.
Pearl, you don't have a big personality.
How are you gonna
overcome that for this award?
Um, I think that I have
a great personality, actually.
Pearl, I'm twisting your tits here
because you were in the bottom last week.
-Right.
-And I want to make sure
that this week you up the ante.
You kind of told me I had no personality.
That doesn't give me confidence.
Well, I'm hoping it will
light a fire under your ass.
Is there something on my face?
No, I'm just not convinced
and I want you to do well.
That's why I brought your ass here.
{\an8}It's so...
{\an8}...intense.
I never want to see any of my girls
not live up to their potential.
-This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
-Yeah, I'm aware of that.
Yeah.
All right.
I will see you all later.
Thank you, Ru.
I feel very uncomfortable right now.
{\an8}I'm, like, tripping. I don't know what...
{\an8}...to do.
-I'm over this bullshit.
-We're finishing writing.
We'll make it great.
Impress Kathy.
I, like, need a minute.
Pearl walked out of the workroom.
I'm not sure she's coming back at all.
{\an8}There was a standoff between Ru and Pearl.
She ended up walking out.
I'm scared that she's not coming back,
'cause this is a co-presenter team thing.
So..."But enough about us,
we want to thank you, the audience."
{\an8}Kasha and I are doing our routines.
Now, we're at the point of editing.
{\an8}I look back and Pearl's still not there.
And I'm like, "What the hell is going on"?
How are you feeling?
Pearl feels defeated. I'm like, "Shit!
That energy can't be in this situation."
<i>I'm hoping that we're</i>
<i>just gonna be able to shake this off.</i>
She knows that if she doesn't
do well tomorrow, she will probably...
...be saying good-bye.
-Hi! [laughing].
-Hello!
{\an8}Kasha and I are getting feedback
with the comedy coach, Kathy Griffin.
It's so great to meet you and see you.
I'm pretty sure we'll
knock this one out of the park.
-All right, what you got?
-Enough about us. We wanna thank you--
Cut that line. Every award show says,
"Enough about us." Okay, go ahead.
"Ginger Minj, or as I call her, the
'Danny Devito of drag,' is in the house."
Danny Devito? That's, like, the least
gay reference I've ever heard in my life.
-It's just--
-Gay it up!
-Because she's, like, so--
-Gayer!
-More gay!
<i>-She's just like, "Nope!</i>
That's not good. Shorten that. Cut this.
Do this." So it throws me for a loop.
Then, we're going to intro to
the first presenters and that was it.
So, what did you have?
Just, "And the first presenters are..."?
{\an8}We're like, "Ugh! Back to
the drawing board."
-"Girl, you look nice tonight."
-"Girl, you look nice, girl."
-"Do you know what we look like?"
"Girl, what?"
-"The number 10."
-"Girl, you is a trip."
Okay, stop.
No more "girls." No more-- You're starting
every sentence with girl.
To me, it's like halfway there.
{\an8}Okay, girl.
"Due to her Craigslist ad, I thought
she was a pig bottom. Floss, anyone?"
Okay. I'm gonna stop you. It's a bit
too blue, and you're hearing that from me.
-So--
-What does that mean, "blue"?
Words that may be bleeped
would be considered blue humor.
The more you know.
"We're simply thrilled to be
looking down upon your oily faces."
"It's like a Nickelback concert mosh pit,
but with less class and more body odor."
Oh, God. All right, I love that
you're shady and fun and snarky.
Don't direct it at
the audience and the judges.
It turns into such a shade shit fest,
you just end up turning them off.
All right.
I think I just completely
changed your opening.
After this altercation, there's a lot of
pressure to deliver. We need to kill it.
-[both] "And the nominees are..."
-"A girl who puts the cunt in country..."
All right, that's a Rosanne Cash joke,
so just rewrite that one.
"Tonight, we are here to celebrate
the brightest stars in our industry."
"Unfortunately, none of them
were available."
It's like a couple of drag queens
throwing the same old shade at each other.
Give 'em something new.
[Ginger] <i>I used to think I was funny</i>
<i>until I met Kathy Griffin.</i>
{\an8}I'ma have to call my momma and
have her tell me how good I am.
Oh, girl.
{\an8}Next, we have to vote on the queen we want
to nominate for each category.
Whoever wins, you get a real sense
of what the other queens think of you.
{\an8}The Shadiest Queen? Violet is going
to take that one. By a landslide.
{\an8}Another glorious day.
{\an8}Today, we're getting ready for
the first annual Despy Awards.
I'm just happy to be nominated.
I'm feeling so much better today.
How about you?
I feel very good today, and thank you
for being so supportive and amazing.
I'm just gonna have fun with it
and do a good job and...
bow out gracefully if that's
what destiny has in store.
<i>Sometimes I do feel like</i>
<i>I am stuck in my shell.</i>
{\an8}The majority of my teen years
were spent really angry
and dealing with, like,
abandonment issues and...
I didn't know how to talk to people.
I know that a lot of my issues
stem from that experience,
so, if I can learn here that
it's cool to open up more...
"Come out of your shell, Pearl."
It'll be a good thing in the end.
<i>[sings] Ooh, when I think about chicken</i>
<i>It makes me happy</i>
{\an8}Chickens are my favorite animal.
I grew up on a farm with lots of chickens
and my job was to raise them
to be beautiful and flawless for the fair.
You can blow-dry them
and use vitamin E on their feet.
Liquid bluing makes
a white chicken sparkle.
You show the judge its asshole
and then they say, "Your bird's healthy."
When I was a kid, I used to go outside
and sing random songs to my chickens.
-What?
-I'd get into it, like, "They love it."
Bitch, this visual you just gave me,
you in a barn, covered in hay.
I hatched chickens under
my bed in an incubator.
This chicken actually won me an award,
right here. Animals were my best friends.
Imagine me about 30 pounds heavier
and a big nerd and loving chickens.
[clucking]
That's how I talk to chickens.
I feel good about us, Fame. It's good
we're getting to know each other.
Working with you has been such a pleasure.
I can't wait...
until I outshine you.
Violet, shut your hole.
{\an8}I can see how Fame thinks I'm a dark witch
or whatever, but I really like Miss Fame.
Today, I'm starting to really see
a change in Violet for the better.
It's nice. I'm probably one of the only
people she considers a friend right now,
and she does need a friend.
[RuPaul laughing, "Cover Girl" playing]
Welcome to the main stage
of <i>RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
{\an8}Michelle Visage, have you got
your thighs on the prize?
Always.
{\an8}-Super judge Ross Mathews.
-You're an award I'd love to win.
{\an8}And fabulous award-winning designer,
my pal, Isaac Mizrahi.
-House of Mizrahi represent.
-Don't you forget it, okay?
-Time for a death drop.
-Get ready to gag.
-Sickening.
-Imagine if I did a death drop now?
I don't know if the AARP
covers death drops.
This week, we challenged our queens
to put on an awards show like no other.
Tonight, they valet their limousines
and get ready to snatch some trophies.
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.
[RuPaul] <i>Almost live</i>
<i>from the slums of Hollywood,</i>
<i>the first annual Despy Awards.</i>
<i>And now, our hostesses with the mostesses,</i>
{\an8}<i>Mrs. Kasha Davis and Katya.</i>
Oh, my goodness. We want to welcome to--
welcome you to the first Despy Awards.
Now, Katya, what in the hell
does Despy stand for?
Judging from the looks of the nominees,
I'm gonna go with Desperate
Egotistical Sluts Prancing in the Yard.
[laughter]
Got it. The talented
Ginger Minj is here tonight,
or as I like to refer to her,
the Danny Devito of drag.
And we have in our presence,
Miss Lame. Shame. Pain.
-Whatever.
-Whatever.
The gorgeous Pearl, the drag equivalent
of a Valium taking a Xanax in a k-hole.
-And last, but not least--
-As usual
-We have...
-[both] Violet.
Please, welcome to the stage
the stars of Tyler Perry's Roots,
Kennedy Davenport and
Miss Jaidynn Diore Fierce.
{\an8}Hello, everyone. Straight from
Kunta Kinte's Hut...
...the hourglass and the wall clock.
-Hold on, who's the wall clock?
-Step over there.
-Okay.
-Do this.
-Okay.
-My point.
Anyways, we are here
to present this award
-for the "Sexy, Sexy Drag Queen".
-Let us announce these awful nominees.
-Kandy... [sings] Ho.
-We all know how she got that last name.
-In the back alley, honey.
-Whore.
-Miss Fame.
-Oh, the brand.
Since when did the dollar store
become a brand?
[laughter]
-And Max.
-The queen from that movie <i>Powder</i>?
-Girl.
-The winner is...
Miss Fame.
{\an8}I wish I could cry but goddamn Botox
got me every time.
{\an8}[laughter]
{\an8}Thank you to Mexico for the tapeworm
that snatched my body. The man upstairs,
{\an8}thank you so much for the light.
I look great.
Thank you so much.
<i>Next up, Pearl and Max.</i>
{\an8}It is a true honor to be presenting the
Despy award for "Most Busted Drag Queen."
What is a busted drag queen?
I'm glad you asked.
Oh, yes. The nominees are, Mrs. Potato--
I mean, Miss Jaidynn Diore Fierce.
Miss Ginger Minj.  "Girl."
"After we swing on by gatorland,
we can get on back to my apartment
and swing on my husband."
The Brooke Hogan of drag, Katya.
And last, but certainly not youngest,
Mrs. Kasha Davis.
Did you hear that, dear?
And the winner is...
-[both] Jaidynn Diore Fierce.
-Oh, congratulations.
{\an8}Thank you to all my fellow
horrible drag queens.
{\an8}I hope you all burn in hell.
{\an8}And I mean it.
{\an8}-[award show exit music]
<i>-Next up, Ginger Minj and Kandy Ho.</i>
I am so honored to be here
at the first annual Despy Awards.
And I'm working off community service.
We've gathered the very best to present
the award for the "Shadiest Shade."
Condragulations, Kandy! Oh,
I think it's high time that your beard
gets the public recognition it deserves.
No, Ginger. This award is for knowing
how to throw the shade and not apply it.
[both] And the nominees are...
The girl who puts the fun
in elephant, Ginger Minj.
The... how do I say this
and remain socially responsible?
"Black horse" of the competition,
Kennedy Davenport.
And last, as usual, Violet Chachki.
And the award goes to...
[drum roll]
...Violet Chachki.
{\an8}You don't like me.
You really don't like me.
{\an8}And last, but not least, God, thanks.
{\an8}<i>Next up, Miss Fame</i>
<i>and Violet Chachki.</i>
Are there any married couples in
the house? Michelle Visage, how long?
-17 years.
-Oh, girl, no. How long?
As someone who is highly experienced
with handling meat,
I cannot wait to hear the nominees
 for Meatiest Tuck.
-Oh, so you work in meat packing?
-You could say that.
Well, let's go ahead
and receive the nominees.
Katya. V.I.P. Very impressive package.
-Jaidynn Diore Fierce. "Hey, girl."
-Meatiest Tuck? Girl, let's be honest.
It looks like she smuggled
a honey baked ham in her panties.
-That brings us to our last nominee.
-[both] Pearl.
Pearl's tucking ability
is just like her personality.
Semi-precious, exhausted,
and barely there.
[both] And the Despy Award goes to...
[both] Katya.
{\an8}I believe it was the great
American painter Bob Ross who said
{\an8}"The key to a swollen vagina is...
courage."
-Have a good night. Thank you so much.
-Good night.
Welcome, ladies. First, I want to
remind you being nominated is an honor,
but winning is so much better.
Thank you, Television Critics Association.
Now, based on your Despy presentations,
I've made some decisions.
Max and Pearl...
Condragulations. You're the winners
of this week's challenge.
You've each won a custom jewel package
from Fierce Drag Jewels.
{\an8}Completely unexpected and
I am on top of the moon. See?
-Thank you, darling.
-RuPaul, I got the smack down yesterday.
-And it worked.
-Yes, it worked. Thank you.
-I appreciate you.
-Thank you.
Kennedy Davenport and
Jaidynn Diore Fierce... you are safe.
-Thank you, Ru.
-You may leave the stage.
Ladies, it's time
for the judges' critiques.
-First up, Mrs. Kasha Davis.
-You look gorgeous.
But you need to take it way over the top.
I see nothing over-the-top about you.
That's a hard job, opening the show.
That's tough, you know, to be
overshadowed by the people following you.
-Next up, Katya.
-You guys struggled in the opening a bit,
but when you accepted your award,
I thought you were so funny.
For your look, I just want
a little bit more volume on your hair.
Are you kidding me? This is from
the Brooke Hogan collection.
Get out your rat-tail, and start teasing.
Give us some kind of volume.
-Okay.
-Thank you, New Jersey's Michelle Visage.
Thank you.
Next up, Ginger Minj.
Your performance, you had, like,
an <i>All About Eve</i>, Nomi Malone in <i>Showgirls</i>
on the stairs moment where
you were like, "Get out of my way.
-This is my moment," which was fun to see.
-You should cut back on your black spray.
-My felt forehead?
-Just cut it back a little bit, girl.
Next up, Kandy Ho.
You look like Natalie Wood, but
this dress is not my favorite thing.
I think it's, like, swallowing you up
in not a good way.
Unfortunately, you were
paired with Ginger,
so it's up to you to up your game to
keep up with her, and she stole the show.
Thank you, Kandy.
Next up, Violet Chachki.
You look so fabulous. I look at you and
I go, "That's a modern queen." So refined.
In your performance, you have a tendency
 to speed up. You speed up in this way.
-Totally.
-Let us hear it, so we can actually laugh.
-Why did they vote you shadiest queen?
-There is some truth to it.
My guess is that you spend a lot of time
by yourself reading fashion magazines.
I look at fashion all the time.
Obviously, the Internet happened, Ru.
-Did you hear about it?
-Oh.
[Michelle laughing]
-All right, thanks, Violet.
-Thank you.
Next up, Miss Fame.
The short sleeve turtleneck with the
opera length glove just makes me so happy.
Your performance with Violet, it was
low-energy for me and didn't really hit.
But I think there's a funniness about you.
You give me a modern thing about comedy.
I can really see you consciously trying
to show us more than just beauty.
I'm just wanting to get past my own head.
How is your head?
I'm thinking a lot and I know
you guys can see that.
I don't even know how to
turn off my thinker.
-Hasn't had any complaints yet.
-Okay.
Thank you, Miss Fame.
All right, thank you, ladies.
I think we've heard enough.
While you untuck backstage,
the judges and I will deliberate.
[engine revs up]
Just between us gladiators.
What do you think?
Starting with Kasha Davis.
Here's someone who has the chops and
didn't bring it tonight. Very frustrating.
This is like a workhorse queen, you know,
and a workhorse queen has to
make us laugh the minute we see her.
-It didn't happen tonight.
-I could be wrong. Maybe she's hilarious.
-No.
-Katya.
Katya's acceptance speech
was a great moment.
She wasn't that funny as the show opened
so I was so happy she had that moment.
As a long-time fan of the show,
what I love are the layers of irony,
and with Katya, there is a core of irony.
-Kandy Ho.
-She would've been gone without the blue.
-Ginger ate her up.
-Kandy Ho is fading away for me.
-Ginger Minj.
-Well, I thought Ginger was a powerhouse.
Don't you think, because her partner
didn't get any of the punchlines,
-is she responsible at all for that?
-No.
That's showbiz, kid. Sometimes, you got to
elbow your way to the front of the stage.
Well, remind me never to perform
on the same stage as Ross, okay?
-Miss Fame.
-I think there was a little stumbling
but she picked herself back up.
Looking at her just makes me live,
die, and then come back to life.
So fresh for a queen to look like that
and then be like this honest, goofy kid.
-Yeah.
-Violet Chachki.
I noted the jokes
about her today from the other queens.
-I don't think they like her very much.
-She doesn't get on well with the others.
She is a child of the Internet.
That is something you do alone.
Frankly, she wasn't necessarily
funny and it was a let down.
Come on, her acceptance speech
was hilarious. Excuse me,
who doesn't want to be the
shadiest queen? I mean...
how punk rock is that?
Silence. I've made my decision.
Bring back my... girls?
Welcome back, ladies.
I've made some decisions.
Ginger Minj...
you're safe.
Kandy Ho... tonight
you looked like Natalie Wood,
but your delivery was a little wooden.
I'm sorry, my dear, but
you are up for elimination.
Miss Fame...
you're safe.
Katya... you're safe.
Violet Chachki... your jokes
got lost in the shade.
Mrs. Kasha Davis, your big opening
was a little sloppy.
Mrs. Kasha Davis, I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
Violet Chachki... you're safe.
Two queens stand before me.
This is your last chance to impress me
and save yourself from elimination.
The time has come.
I want you to lip-synch...
for your life!
[Kasha] <i>I absolutely deserve</i>
<i>to be in this competition.</i>
{\an8}Ru, I am ready. Let's do this.
[RuPaul] Good luck...
and don't fuck it up.
[Ginger] <i>Mrs. Kasha Davis pulls up</i>
<i>the slit in that skirt</i>
{\an8}and, honey, she is serving
these young kids.
[Jaidynn] <i>Miss Kandy,</i>
<i>she start off slow and sexy,</i>
{\an8}then she worked her way up and she
just hit in her gear. I am living for it.
[RuPaul laughing]
Ladies, I've made my decision.
Kandy Ho, shantay, you stay.
Thank you.
Mrs. Kasha Davis, you're terrific. Now,
call Mr. Davis and tell him
momma's coming home.
He better have that box wine chilling.
Sashay away.
-Love you, gals.
-[Katya] Love you.
There's always time for a cocktail.
<i>What? I wasn't ready to leave.</i>
One thing that frustrated me the most
were certain people who gave up, you know?
And that kind of pisses me off,
but such is life. It's the game.
{\an8}Condragulations, ladies.
{\an8}Remember, if you can't love yourself, how
the hell are you gonna love somebody else?
{\an8}-Can I get a "amen" up in here?
-Amen.
{\an8}All right, now let the music play.
[vocalizing]
{\an8}[RuPaul] Bye!


{\an8}Fame just rubs my nerves out.
That's not drag.
{\an8}You'll be acting in Romy and Juliet,
and my favorite, MacBitch.
Head coach... head cheerleader is going
to be me, Laquisha Quian. Oh, fuck.
In seven seasons, I've never seen
a car crash like this before.
Max, you are the winner
of this week's challenge.
[applause]
Pearl, you've been sleepwalking.
Wake up, Pearl.
Couldn't you sense that
it wasn't going right?
Nobody knew their lines.
I'm not gonna take their blame.
I don't want to hear
any goddamn excuses anymore!
Kennedy Davenport.
Shantay, you stay.
Jasmine Masters. Sashay away.
{\an8}-[Kennedy] Oh, lord.
-Home sweet home.
{\an8}[Ginger] <i>It's so quiet.</i>
<i>Jasmine gave us all that energy,</i>
{\an8}and it's not there anymore.
{\an8}[Katya] So how did you feel?
{\an8}You know, to do it against your friend...
it was hard.
It's bittersweet because
me and Jasmine are so close.
{\an8}But I just have another chance.
Pop the corns and feed the children.
Pop the corns and feed the children.
{\an8}Jasmine was just
a bad seed in the bunch.
{\an8}Nobody wants to pop the corn
and feed the children. That's disgusting.
Let me pop this bunion and
have the kids feasting for days?
Are you kidding me?
Who thinks of this shit?
[Trixie] Pearl, did your life
flash before your eyes?
Yeah, you thought you were going home.
I don't know, it's crazy.
Usually I have a blast when I'm in drag.
But it was all about me walking
with my eyes half closed.
I thought I had bedroom eyes.
Pearl's been sleepwalking
through this competition.
Pearl has to get her head in the game
if she wants to make the top three.
<i>The winner of RuPaul's Drag Race</i>
<i>receives a one year supply</i>
<i>of Anastasia Beverly Hills cosmetics,</i>
<i>and a cash prize of $100,000.</i>
<i>With our extra special guest judges,</i>
<i>Lucian Piane and Jessica Alba.</i>
-[Trixie] Yay.
-Good morning.
{\an8}Last week we got our asses
handed to us by RuPaul and the judges.
But we're ready to step it up
and kick this challenge's ass.
-It's a whole new day.
-It's a new hole day.
[alarm sounding]
[RuPaul] <i>She done already</i>
<i>done had herses.</i>
-<i>Hey, ladies.</i>
-[all] Hey.
<i>To become America's Next Drag Superstar,</i>
<i>you need to rock out</i>
<i>with your schlock out,</i>
<i>because, honey,</i>
<i>no queen is unspoofable.</i>
<i>Take it from me. I am RuPaul,</i>
<i>the elusive chanteuse.</i>
[laughter]
[Trixie and Katya] We're singing!
Hello, hello, hello.
[all] Hi.
You know in showbiz,
one day you're in on the joke,
and the next day,
the joke is on you.
So for this week's maxi challenge,
you'll be creating music video parodies
of one of my favorite artists ever!
-Me.
-[laughter, cheering]
[screams]
Working in three teams, you'll have to
write lyrics, record vocals,
{\an8}and then shoot your own
#PunnyOrDie music video.
{\an8}I feel really good about this challenge.
I can sing, and comedy is what I do.
Now, to mix things up, I'm gonna leave it
up to you to divide yourselves into teams.
All right, go for it, now.
[chatter]
Honey, I am a singer,
so I get boom, boom, boom.
-Are we a team?
-Three people cling to me for dear life.
I want you on my team.
I go right to Katya because she's funny.
I look right at Fame because she can sing.
And I love Pearl, so that was our group.
-Well, I guess that leaves us three.
-Here, let's do it. Let's just do it.
Yay.
{\an8}I've already been picked last
for teams twice, so who the fuck cares?
Now, for this challenge,
you really need to straddle the world
of music... and comedy.
[laughter]
Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best woman win.
[Violet] Let's get to work.
I think this challenge is complicated.
We have to come up with new lyrics
{\an8}to "Sissy That Walk" and then come up
with a music video. The pressure is on.
What if it's like, "Your face like chalk,"
and do really bad makeup or something?
[Violet] I mean, that's, like,
the obvious thing.
We can probably come up with better.
Hm.
{\an8}Violet does have a tendency
to be sort of, uh...
{\an8}...bitchy.
[Violet] We have to get
these lyrics really funny...
I don't want to rely on grossness or
sexuality. That's what people always do.
"I don't want to be raunchy or dirty."
Are you fucking kidding me?
-Okay.
-We get "Dance With U."
I'm pretty confident that we can
make it into a funny parody.
I want to do
"I Want to Tan With You."
Let's think of a couple more options.
Well, maybe two more.
We could make it about raunchy,
dirty sex because that always is funny.
[Pearl] No, it's gonna be gross.
Give us a better concept
so we don't have to worry about that.
Well it shouldn't fall
on my shoulders just because...
-No, I get it, but, like--
-Thank you.
Pearl has really been falling short.
It's frustrating, because I'm on a team
with you. We have to pull each other up
or else your friends are going home.
[Miss Fame] We need to come up with
something. We're running out of time.
-Let's just do fucking tan with you.
-[Miss Fame] Okay.
-Hello, hello, hello.
-[all] Hello.
-Hey, kitty girl.
-[all] Hi.
-I am very excited about this challenge.
-[all] We are too.
-Do any of you do parodies in your act?
-Rihanna's song. I turned it into "Suh,
burb and, and, and".
A little suburban gal number.
Ah.
Now, Kennedy, you were
in the bottom two last week.
Has that lit a fire under your tuchus?
-Oh, it definitely has.
-I have to tell all of you.
As the competition shrinks,
it gets stronger.
I'm expecting you all to deliver.
I had a shitty last challenge,
and Ru is expecting big things.
I have to shake it off
and keep my head in the game.
-Hey, kitty girl.
-Hi, RuPaul.
So are you fans of song parodies?
If they're clever. Sometimes they get
a bit raunchy and vulgar for me, but...
-Well, don't compromise your Christianity.
-No, Ma'am. [laughs]
-So, what song are you working on?
-"Sissy That Walk".
We want it to be a tie-in
to the top three from last season.
-What became of "Sissy That Walk"?
-"Get Ready to Clock."
Uh-huh.
Well, I cannot wait to see
what you have to offer,
-because I'm expecting a lot from you.
-Thank you, Ru.
-Hello.
-Hi, Ru.
I feel like Trixie is the leader
because I know you do a lot of comedy.
Turns out making fun of you
is a lot easier than I thought.
[RuPaul laughs]
She definitely thought of the concept.
-[RuPaul] What is the concept?
-[Pearl] "Tan With You."
-Four ladies who just love the sun.
-Overcooked, overgrown orangutans.
I love that. That sounds fun.
So now, with lyrics...
Are any of you lyricists?
We're comfortable to say,
"Not funny. We're not doing that."
I know, it's been
a little bit harsh over here.
Who is the most harsh?
All right.
Pearl and Fame are butting heads.
This is not a good sign.
{\an8}-Hi, season seven queens.
-[all] Yes.
{\an8}For today's maxi challenge,
we have to do a parody music video.
{\an8}Our team is working with the talented
Lucian Piane, RuPaul's producer.
-So we'll start with--
-[violently clears throat]
-Katya?
-Huh?
-Have you ever been recorded before?
-Yeah, once before, and it was a disaster.
-Oh.
-So I'm gonna go with a weird drunk skank,
-I think.
-Ok, so that's your character.
Okay, yeah, let's stop.
It's a great performance. I just think
that you're actually going too far.
-We need to get the words across.
-Okay.
Three Long Island Iced Teas, not ten.
-All the way up. You're a little flat.
-[Lucian laughs]
All right, calm down, Mariah.
-You can't sing it up?
-No. I don't have it.
-Yeah, so...
-Okay, okay. We'll keep it down.
Was that wrong?
Every time I was on a team,
I've been with Trixie.
When we get into challenges,
I see her kind of buckle.
Stop for one second. Let's try to find
what pitch you're gonna sing on.
-Up a little higher.
-You come in after the downbeat.
You got that white boy timing.
[Miss Fame] You have to hear the sound.
You should be quicker. It sounds like
you're drawing them out over the beat.
Oh, fuck, sorry.
Get out of your shell, girl.
-What are you like onstage?
-I'm wild.
-I'm totally wild.
-So where is that right now?
{\an8}Pearl and I are sisters. We worked in
Chicago before she moved to New York.
She's just extremely chill.
The way she talks, moves, everything.
But for drag,
she needs to get herself a fresh pair of
batteries or they'll say she doesn't care.
{\an8}-Hey.
-Hey.
{\an8}How are you doing?
We're gonna do a parody of the
"Sissy That Walk" video from last season.
Courtney is played by Max, I am Bianca,
and Adore is played by Violet.
-Cue track.
-[playback music]
-I feel like you're a little nervous.
-Yeah, I am.
You know,
Bianca isn't really a singer.
That's an opportunity for you to
not sing him so much and make it funny.
Nice. That was so much better.
-Are you doing it up the octave or--
-I don't know. I haven't done this before.
-All right. Your timing wasn't great.
-I just went off your cue.
{\an8}There's tension between
Lucian and Violet,
Violet has a tendency to snap at people
when they give hr constructive criticism.
{\an8}-Hello, ladies.
-[all] Hi.
{\an8}So Ru assigns our team
"Let The Music Play",
{\an8}and that bitch is always getting paid,
{\an8}so why don't we write a parody that's
all about the products that she sells?
-All right, here we go.
-[music playback]
Well, uh...
Ethel Merman and Paul Lynde
had a love child
bursting forth from
Kasha's vocal chords.
[laughs]
Oh, my God.
Yay.
I don't know how exceptionally well
we did in that room,
but if we don't feel 100%, then we have to
make up for it everywhere else.
My voice was probably
the strongest of the group's,
<i>but in a team, you have to worry</i>
<i>about other people.</i>
Ain't no bad apple gonna rot my crop.
Turn the lights on now.
It should be like a...
maybe a... since we're up,
it's up, out, and then down.
Then people should drop back.
It'll have depth of field.
For somebody with almost no performance
experience, Miss Fame has a lot to say.
-Okay, so get into your last position.
-[Trixie] This is "Sunblock Down Girl."
This is where you end it.
No, we're coming back up from that.
We're coming up from down...
-We have to figure out the next move.
-Go ahead. What do you want it to be?
If you would get into the fucking position
we could jump into it.
Calm your ass down.
-I am calm, you're not listening though.
-Then what are you trying to say?
-Go ahead, project.
-I'm trying.
{\an8}What in the fucking hell
is going on here?
[Miss Fame] We have too many chiefs
and not enough Indians.
It's going to be a disaster.
{\an8}[RuPaul] Wow.
{\an8}I'm totally having a flashback.
We recorded our track with Lucian. Now we
record the video with Michelle and Ru.
Okay, so listen, you kids can use
all the props you want to use,
including the pit crew, you just cannot
take off their Justin Case underwear.
[laughter]
-Okay, now think Adore.
-Party.
-Hey, Violet, did you cinch?
-No, I have a hog body.
Get it, girl.
-[laughing]
{\an8}Max looks like himself
with a wig on.
{\an8}That's not great.
-So, Max.
-Yes, darling?
You've got to be more Courtney.
Courtney was manic in that video.
-With her... crazy eyes.
-Time for my crazy eyes.
I'm having a little bit of a struggle
with the characterization.
Courtney's a little bit harder
to make, uh, funny.
Whew.
{\an8}-Wow, look who's here.
-Hi, ladies.
All right, so let's see
what you've got.
[laughing]
{\an8}Kennedy has such a funny part. She's
putting her ghetto in. It feels so good.
Okay, let's cut it for a minute.
Cut, cut for a minute.
Now, what was that
Drag U lyric again?
What did you say about Drag U?
That was a rough spot.
All right, all right.
Yeah, it was one of my favorite jobs.
It did change people's lives, you know.
Bitch, my heart fell through my chest
to the basement.
We've already laid down the track.
There's no time to change this.
{\an8}Oh, my goodness,
It's Tan Mom and all of her friends.
-Back from the Jersey Shore.
-Alright, here we go.
-[Trixie] Is this me?
Cut. Trixie, why do you keep walking
in and out of the shot?
I thought, just record my phone thing
and be done with it.
Just stay in and model.
If you're not singing, just ham it up.
Motherfucker.
Okay, you have some group choreography,
let's see that.
We also wanted to do a shot
where we're low to the ground.
After we do the group choreography,
let's get on the ground.
[Katya] Let's get props.
-[Trixie] Let's do it on the ground.
-When the time comes...
-Tick tock, time is ticking.
-We could roll like rotisserie chickens.
You want to try this, girl?
-All right, let's... cue the track.
-And the snipers.
[laughs]
[Miss Fame] Okay, okay.
Are we kicking feet?
The whole shoot seems
a little disorganized.
[Miss Fame] Left, right.
Left, right... Oh, girl.
RuPaul and Michelle are going to think
we're a bunch of disorganized fuck-tards.
{\an8}-Let's work it out.
-All right, let's do it.
{\an8}Today we're getting ready for our
all green Eleganza runway.
Everybody's just anxiously waiting to see
how it all turns out on the main stage.
Girl, I see all these pictures over here
with Sahara. How do you know her?
-Well, Sahara's my sister.
-Oh, "Davenport," duh. [laughs]
[chuckles] Yeah.
This was when we first
started coming out together.
{\an8}Me and my sister, Sahara Davenport,
we met in high school,
and we shared a lot of
the same dreams.
[Kasha] Was it a big shocker
when she passed?
[Kennedy] Indeed it was. We just knew she
was in the hospital. Then she passed.
That was most heartbreaking for me
because I'm way in Dallas.
I had no money to go
to the funeral or anything, so...
-Isn't it the worst feeling in the world?
-That was, like, the worst.
That was my sister for real. If we'd come
out the same pussy, we would have.
Talking about Sahara, it feels good
to know that her legacy is still alive.
It's not just about me.
My family motivated me
to stay in this race.
[RuPaul laughs]
Ooh, girl.
Welcome to the main stage
of <i>RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
{\an8}Michelle Visage, that color looks gorgeous
on you. You should wear it more often.
-Someone's got to show these bitches.
-She bring it to you every ball.
{\an8}And Drag Race super fan and super judge,
Ross Mathews. Welcome back.
{\an8}Thank you. I'm here to butch it up
a little bit.
[RuPaul laughs]
{\an8}And producer of my album <i>Born Naked</i>,
Lucian Piane is here.
{\an8}-Hey, Ru.
-From musician to musician,
is this the first time
you ever used auto-tune?
[laughter]
And actress and co-founder
of the Honest Company,
{\an8}Jessica Alba is here. Hey, girl. I love
the body oil. It smells like creamsicle.
-I picked out the scent.
-[laughter]
Welcome.
This week, we challenged our queens
to create "Rusic" video parodies,
and tonight, they're ready to hit
the runway dressed in... all green.
[RuPaul laughs]
Sorry about it, Michelle. [laughs]
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.
{\an8}[RuPaul] Up first is Pearl.
{\an8}-Pearl-aconda.
-[laughter]
[Pearl] <i>I am slithering</i>
<i>down this runway.</i>
<i>Instead of wearing something that's green,</i>
<i>I'd rather be something that's green.</i>
[Michelle] She's got a snake
that needs to be charmed.
[RuPaul] Thanks for the memories.
{\an8}[RuPaul] Miss Fame. Green goddess.
-[Jessica] I love the shoulder pads.
-[Michelle] Those are her shoulders.
[Miss Fame] <i>So I'm wearing this cosmic,</i>
<i>alien, galactic, green gown.</i>
<i>I've got my face painted for the gods</i>
<i>and I'm living for the fantasy.</i>
-[Michelle] Lana Turned-Her.
-[laughter]
{\an8}[RuPaul] Trixie Mattel.
{\an8}-[Michelle] Domo arigata-ho.
-[laughter]
[Trixie] <i>I'm giving classic beauty</i>
<i>married to Chinese feast.</i>
<i>Hold the MSG, but you will</i>
<i>be hungry again in an hour.</i>
-[Michelle] She's been Shang-hi-ied.
-[laughter]
{\an8}[RuPaul] Katya. Emerald City fashion week.
[all] Oh.
[Katya] <i>I am in love with my look.</i>
<i>I'm sissying that leg.</i>
<i>I feel confident, I feel sexy,</i>
<i>I feel stupid.</i>
[RuPaul] Yes, honey,
she is serving green legs and ham.
{\an8}[RuPaul] Max. I think she went
too big with her cup size.
[Michelle] Her lucky charms.
[Max] <i>I'm the three "A's". Antique,</i>
<i>androgynous, Antoinette, if you will.</i>
[Jessica] She's a little bitchy.
It's a period piece.
{\an8}[RuPaul] Jaidynn Diore Fierce. You know,
I was looking for camouflage
{\an8}the other week
but I couldn't find it.
-[RuPaul] There she is.
-[all] Oh.
[Jaidynn] <i>I'm giving them</i>
<i>bright neon, camouflage realness,</i>
<i>and I'm feeling it.</i>
<i>I ain't trying to hide that much.</i>
[Michelle] She's got a sea-weave.
{\an8}[RuPaul] Violet Chachki. Oh, wow.
-[RuPaul] V is for victory.
-[Michelle] It's also for vagina.
That is the most perfect ass.
[Violet] <i>Bitch, I am serving lime green</i>
<i>showgirl. I'm giving you ass, ass, ass.</i>
[RuPaul] It's almost as if the road runner
were a showgirl in green.
-[Michelle] Meep meep!
-[Jessica laughs]
{\an8}-[RuPaul] Kandy Ho.
-[Michelle] The <i>chartreuse chanteuse</i>.
[RuPaul] How green was my
valley of the dolls. [chuckling]
[Kandy] <i>I'm just giving you</i>
<i>a sweet and sexy side of me,</i>
<i>and hopefully, that sweetness</i>
<i>stays in your mouth,</i>
<i>and you taste it all the way through.</i>
-[Jessica] She's a hot Latina.
-[Michelle] My hair matches my dress.
-[RuPaul] Just the tip.
-[Michelle and Jessica] Just the tip.
{\an8}-[RuPaul] Mrs. Kasha Davis.
-[Jessica] Cash Money Millionaire.
-[RuPaul] Yes.
-[Michelle] Opulence. She owns everything.
[Kasha] <i>Mrs. Kasha Davis</i>
<i>wants to let everybody know</i>
<i>that she made some money in the red light</i>
<i>district, but it's her money nonetheless.</i>
-[RuPaul] She put the "cash" in Kasha.
-[Michelle] Dollar make you holler.
{\an8}[RuPaul] LaGuardia Newark Kennedy.
{\an8}-[all] Oh!
-[RuPaul] She is playing her green card.
[Kennedy] <i>I'm serving</i>
<i>with the utmost confidence,</i>
<i>because my hair is whooped</i>
<i>and beat, my face is done,</i>
<i>and you cannot tell me nothing.</i>
<i>All that glitters is green.</i>
[Lucien] How much did her hair
have to smoke to get that high?
{\an8}-[RuPaul] Ginger Minj.
-[Jessica] Oh, she's cute.
-[RuPaul] Perky in pistachio.
-[laughter]
[Ginger] <i>I am serving you</i>
<i>some leprechaun realness.</i>
<i>I look like a glamour toad</i>
<i>and I feel like a million bucks.</i>
-[RuPaul] Not today, satin, not today.
-[Michelle laughs] Oh, my God.
Welcome, ladies.
It's time to debut your videos.
First up, the parody
of "Dance With U."
-[laughter]
-[RuPaul laughs]
-[laughter]
[laughter]
Oh, my God.
[applause]
Next up, the parody
of "Sissy That Walk."
[laughter, applause]
All right, last but not least,
the parody of "Let The Music Play".
-Only 32 years, girl.
{\an8}[laughter]
[applause]
You can re-watch the "Rusic" videos
at logotv.com.
Ladies, I've made some decisions.
[RuPaul] When I call your name,
please step forward.
Katya.
Jaidynn Diore Fierce.
Kennedy Davenport.
This week, each of you emerged
as the star of your group.
Oh.
But one of you really made a mockery
of everything I hold sacred.
Kennedy Davenport. Condragulations, you
are the winner of this week's challenge.
Oh, my God.
<i>You will receive a three year supply</i>
<i>of essential family products</i>
-from the Honest Company.
-They smell really good.
Thank you so much.
Miss Fame and Ginger Minj,
you're both safe.
Thank you.
The five of you may leave the stage.
Ladies, it's time for
the judges' critiques.
First up, Pearl.
About your character
in the "Tan With You" video,
you have to loosen it up, girl.
Come out of your shell.
We want more vitality and more energy
and more star power.
Are you a stoner, girl?
'Cause that's, like, the vibe I got.
There's plenty of girls here that take
their time "Coming out of their shell,"
but I feel picked on, almost.
-[RuPaul] All right, thanks, Pearl.
-Thank you.
Moving on. Trixie Mattel.
The idea of "Tan With You" is funny.
Were there big, butt-gusting,
knee-slapping, LOLs? No, but I liked it.
You are not standing out for me,
and I want to see some identity and some
flavor. I'm not getting that from you yet.
If you're gonna be the Comedy Queen,
you have to go all the way.
Don't let anyone else stand out.
You have to.
Next up, Max.
I do enjoy the look tonight.
I wish it was all green.
-It's a hint of green, really.
-Okay.
And I'm going to challenge you
to give us a look without gray hair.
All right.
I know there's not a lot of green, but I
just think it's so creative and so cool.
-Thank you.
-You were the weakest in your group.
Courtney Act is not easy to do.
She's not a big personality,
but I felt like you could have done more.
Next up, Violet Chachki.
Your tushy is so phenomenal.
It's just perfection.
-[RuPaul] Yes.
-It's so good.
Your Adore was quite good, too.
You could have done more besides
just the stomping and the open mouth,
-but again, more bigger. Now is your time.
-Right.
Thank you very much.
Next up, Kandy Ho.
<i>Hola.</i>
If you look around,
everyone has looks, concepts,
and I don't think
a pretty dress is enough.
You were on a team with three other
really big personalities,
and I wanted you to stand out even more.
You got lost in that challenge.
Next up, Mrs. Kasha Davis.
You walked out in that outfit,
and I love a <i>schticky</i> queen,
and it's a great twist
on the green theme.
[Michelle] So let's talk about the video,
this kind of sing-talk thing that you do.
You don't think you can sing,
is that where we're going?
What happened was, I think Bea Arthur
was inside me when we were recording,
and I was like, "There's the voice today."
We have something in common.
Bea Arthur was once inside me as well.
-Wow.
-[laughter]
All right, ladies,
I think we've heard enough.
While you untuck backstage,
the judges and I will deliberate.
All right, just between you, me, and these
fierce drag jewels I'm wearing...
[laughter]
What do you think? Pearl.
She just kind of feels lazy.
And it's like, don't be lazy.
This is it.
I feel like it's nervousness.
-What would you tell her?
-Get your head out of your ass.
Work it out.
Trixie Mattel.
She says she is campy and dresses like it,
but I've not seen the personality yet.
I didn't really understand who Trixie was.
She was lost in the video.
I've seen many audition tapes, and hers
was one of the funniest I've ever seen,
but Trixie has yet to emerge as Trixie.
-[RuPaul] Max.
-You can tell how creative she is,
and you have to be intelligent
to be that creative.
I was a little underwhelmed
by this characterization.
She was worried more about being
the best Courtney Act she could be...
...instead of being
the drag version of Courtney Act.
Violet. Here's a queen who has studied.
She's really smart and 22 years old.
-Oh, I want to suck the life out of her.
-[laughter]
It's funny, because Violet
in the studio struggled a little bit
and then I saw the video and I was,
"Oh, my gosh, that's Adore."
I think she could have gone further
in the video, a little more over-the-top.
{\an8}-[RuPaul] Kandy Ho.
-She didn't stand out in the video,
{\an8}but she did a great job with the ad-libs.
That is what impressed me the most.
-Yes.
-But standing next to these other queens,
personally, it wasn't enough.
It seems like she's
really channeling glamour
and that's kind of it.
[RuPaul] All right, Mrs. Kasha Davis.
She did, kind of, blend in
a little bit too much in the video.
I don't know. I love her,
because she harkens back to
a different sort of age of drag to me,
-and as much...
-Why were you looking at me?
[Michelle screams]
-No, I specifically didn't.
-[laughter]
Silence. I've made my decision.
[whispering] Bring back my girls.
-What?
-[shouting] Bring back my girls!
Welcome back, ladies.
I've made some decisions.
Violet Chachki...
...you're safe.
[RuPaul] Max...
...you're safe.
Mrs. Kasha Davis...
-...you're safe.
-Thank you.
Pearl,
you are a magical queen, but your
performance failed to charm the judges.
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you're up for elimination.
{\an8}I felt really good about this challenge,
but who the fuck knows anymore?
Trixie Mattel, you went
for the comedy gold,
but all we got was bronze.
Kandy Ho,
your video performance wasn't sticky,
and your runway look was not so sweet.
Kandy Ho...
-...you're safe.
-Thank you.
Trixie, my dear, I'm sorry,
but you are up for elimination.
Two queens stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me and save yourself
-from elimination.
-[dramatic music]
The time has come...
...for you to lip-sync...
...for your life.
[Trixie] <i>I look over at Pearl.</i>
<i>I love Pearl, but I'm in it to win it.</i>
{\an8}I know the song like
the back of my man hand
{\an8}and I think, I'm going out
kicking and screaming. Let's do this.
Good luck and don't fuck it up.
[Kasha] <i>Trixie's giving it her all.</i>
<i>She's showing some camp.</i>
{\an8}She's showing dance moves. She's working
the runway. I'm enjoying her performance.
I'm so torn because I feel like Trixie
deserves to be here more than me,
but the other half of me is, like,
"No, you get your shit together."
[RuPaul laughs]
[applause]
Ladies,
I've made my decision.
Pearl. Shantay, you stay.
-Talk to me, Pearl.
-[Pearl sobbing]
I just love her so much. I feel...
[sobbing]
All right,
you may join the other girls.
It's okay.
Trixie Mattel,
you are an amazing queen.
Keep on dreaming
and keep 'em laughing.
Now, Sashay away.
Thank you.
[applause]
Bye.
<i>It's kind of embarrassing to be a comedy</i>
<i>queen and go home on a comedy challenge.</i>
I had more cool looks, I had better jokes,
and I'm funnier than I was showing,
so that was a bummer, but I hope I get
to meet lots of fans who like what I do.
{\an8}Condragulations, ladies.
{\an8}If you can't love yourself, how in the
hell are you gonna love somebody else?
{\an8}-Can I get an "Amen" up in here?
-[all] Amen.
{\an8}All right, now let the music play.
{\an8}Bye!


{\an8}<i>Previously, on </i>RuPaul's Drag Race<i>...</i>
{\an8}We're paying tribute
to the legendary director John Waters.
{\an8}[applause]
{\an8}Okay, cut!
It was hard to jump in with my lines
when the bitch before didn't say hers.
Ginger Minj.
Your performance as Edie
was a masterpiece.
-You're the winner of this challenge.
-Thanks.
-Pearl.
-I didn't realize you're the good Divine.
[RuPaul] Miss Fame.
As an actress, you don't have to say:
"Look at me, I'm bad." [growls]
It should come naturally.
Who deserves to go home tonight and why?
-[RuPaul] Fame.
-[Pearl] Fame.
-[Ginger] Fame.
-Fame.
Trixie got to come back so she should be
looked at with a magnifying lens.
There's a part of Pearl
that's too cool for season seven,
and she knows what I mean.
I don't know what she means.
I don't think I'm too cool
for season seven at all.
Pearl, shantay, you stay.
Miss Fame, sashay away.
{\an8}[laughter]
{\an8}Back in the workroom after elimination,
Fame's gone home.
{\an8}"Continue to inspire. You're incredible.
I love you. Fame."
{\an8}Oh, I'm gonna miss her so much.
{\an8}With that being said,
take that shit off the mirror.
{\an8}[laughter]
{\an8}Fame probably felt really attacked,
because she was nice to everyone.
{\an8}Everyone is throwing her under the bus.
It sucks.
{\an8}Fame was really trying.
There are less deserving queens here.
-So congratulations, winner.
-Thank you.
Of all challenges to win,
that's fucking awesome.
[Ginger] Girl, how about Fame
throwing you under the bus?
I didn't expect that at all.
{\an8}"Pearl knows what I'm talking about."
It's like: "No, I don't."
But her calling me out
gave me an extra kick in the ass
to floor the bitch in the lip-sync.
It was really, like, such a close call.
I really could have been lip-syncing.
{\an8}Violet should be very, very grateful
{\an8}that her Lisa Frank couture kept her from
 being in the bottom two this week,
because her performance was abysmal.
Even if it kills me, I'll fucking come out
on top the next challenge.
{\an8}Violet's strengths are her runway
but at this point in the competition
you have to be versatile.
If you only have one strength...
...you're fucked.
{\an8}<i>The winner receives a year supply</i>
<i>of Anastasia Beverly Hills cosmetics</i>
{\an8}<i>and a cash prize of $100,000.</i>
{\an8}<i>With our special guest judges, comedienne</i>
<i>Rachael Harris and Alyssa Milano.</i>
{\an8}[music]
{\an8}-Top six!
-[Trixie] It'd be five without me, sorry.
[Kennedy] Yeah, we are too.
{\an8}It's very humbling to be in the top six
<i>because you never know</i>
<i>when it's your turn.</i>
-[Katya] Fame left me a note.
-Me too.
-Me too!
-[Violet] What does yours say, Pearl?
"Pearl, I love you.
See you in New York City."
[Blows raspberry] I can forgive her.
But I'll never forget.
-[Ginger] What do your notes say?
-[Kennedy] "My girl, you are a class act
and I'm honored
to have been a part of this with you."
Oh, you can read.
-"Stay strong, girl. You are so talented."
-"Violet, you are perfect."
It's so real!
You know what's real? The struggle.
-[alarm sounds]
-[RuPaul oohing]
{\an8}[RuPaul] <i>She done already</i>
<i>done have herses.</i>
<i>-Ladies.</i>
-Hi.
<i>Want to prance for somebody?</i>
<i>Somebody who loves you?</i>
<i>Well, if you can't love yourself,</i>
<i>switch partners!</i>
<i>Because it's time to look at drag</i>
<i>from both sides now.</i>
<i>Cha, cha, cha!</i>
{\an8}-[Katya] It's dancing!
-We're about to twerk!
-Hello, hello, hello!
-[all] Hi!
-You're all getting free cosmetic surgery.
-[Pearl] Ooh.
But you'll be doing it yourselves.
Sorry about that.
For today's mini challenge, you'll serve
some rich bitch reality realness.
Using clear plastic tape,
you need to nip and tuck your mugs
to plastic perfection.
And then you'll be shooting a stiff
and unnatural title sequence
{\an8}for my latest series,
<i>The Fake Housewives of RuPaul's Drag Race</i>.
Now, you've got 20 minutes,
so ready, set, let it rip!
-Bitch, I look fishy as fuck.
-[laughter]
Katya has built a forehead out of tape.
<i>She is serving Herman Munster realness.</i>
Kennedy looks like she usually looks.
Girl, did you put any tape on?
[RuPaul] All right, ladies, time's up!
Masterqueef Theater presents
<i>The Fake Housewives of RuPaul's Drag Race</i>.
Some people call me a slut
but I'm also an alcoholic.
{\an8}[RuPaul laughs]
I'm not the best cookie in the cookie jar,
but at least I taste good.
{\an8}[RuPaul laughs]
When times get tough,
I just breathe through my nose.
{\an8}[RuPaul laughs]
The secret to success
is being God's favorite. Shh.
[RuPaul laughs]
How do I sleep at night? [laughs]
Ask your husband.
{\an8}[RuPaul laughs]
What's the best part
about being married to a sociopath?
The constant threat
of danger keeps you so thin.
{\an8}[RuPaul laughs]
Ladies, you've never looked so... unusual.
The winner of this week's
mini-challenge is...
Violet Chachki.
{\an8}The winner is Kelly Mantle!
[RuPaul] We'll be posting
these gifs at logotv.com.
-Now, are you ladies ready for more?
-Yeah.
For this week's maxi-challenge,
you must prance your padded asses off.
{\an8}#Prancingqueens.
In pairs, you'll dance to mash-ups
like the Tango Vogue, the Charleston Twerk
-and the Country Robot.
-[laughter]
And there's just one more little detail.
For the first time in <i>Drag Race</i> herstory
you'll be decked out
in half-man and half-queen drag.
Think Dr. Jekyll and Mrs. Hyde Your Can.
Violet, you won the mini-challenge,
so you get to assign the couples.
Now this bitch gets to pair up
the teams. [scoffs]
-First, pick your dance partner.
-Katya.
Sorry. No way, bitch. You're on your own.
Unless you can help me win a challenge.
-How about the other queens?
-They're already paired off.
I'm gonna do Ginger and Trixie.
[RuPaul] And you're pairing
Kennedy with Pearl.
[Katya] <i>So Violet chooses my partner,</i>
<i>Ginger.</i>
I'm a little frustrated because
I can sew and dance, and she can't.
Now, tomorrow you'll get into half drag
{\an8}using makeup provided
by Anastasia Beverly Hills.
Now, to win this challenge,
you'll need to apply the rhythm method.
Your charisma,
uniqueness, nerve, and talent.
Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best half-woman win.
Yes!
-Do you know how to tango?
-No.
Arnold Schwarzenegger
and Jamie Lee Curtis.
It's, like, Spanish.
Violet and I are pairs for the first time,
and I'm not sure how this will go.
What's this? Okay, hold on.
Come back here! [chuckles]
{\an8}This week's maxi-challenge makes me
wanna slap somebody's mama.
We have got to do
a prancing with the queens ballroom dance
as half a man and half a woman.
What the hell?
-Do you not dance at all?
-[laughs] Heck, no, ma'am!
-Not even the truffle shuffle.
-Can you robot at all?
Is this good? Is this right?
When I say: "I don't dance",
I mean: "I don't dance!"
-We could do the electric slide.
-What is that?
I mean, that's for the win.
-Hello, hello, hello!
-Hi!
-How are my prancing queens?
-Fabulous.
-Hey, Kennedy. Hey, Pearl.
-Hey, Ru.
-Now, do you dance?
-It's been a while since class.
But I do have it in my spirit.
I love it. I love it.
Pearl, are you good with choreography?
-Mm-hmm.
-I think you just answered that one.
Well, this is a great opportunity for you
to go outside of what you normally do,
'cause I want to see that.
[Kennedy] <i>Pearl can't dance.</i>
{\an8}Choreographed dance and dancing
in the club are two different things.
I hope her personality shines through
and she just plays it out.
-Ginger Minj.
-Hi!
-Trixie, back together again!
-Ginger and Trixie, the sequel.
-I like to call it "the revenge".
-Oh!
What's the hardest part of this challenge?
What are you not looking forward to?
-We'll do it live.
-Mm-hmm.
So I think the pressure of that,
with me not being a dancer,
that's the one part
that keeps playing over in my head.
Yeah. What are you most worried about?
I hate to say
I got outshined by Ginger last week.
I'm not trying to have it happen again.
Okay.
-All right, well, get back to work.
-Thank you.
-Hey, ladies!
-Hi, Ru!
-Now, Violet, do you dance at all?
-I actually... I'm an aerial performer.
If I recall right, in the last challenge,
you had problems with rhythm and timing.
-I did.
-How will you work through that?
Own it, work through it.
I'll turn it out.
Those are famous last words around here.
I already said 'em once, I'm still here.
Yeah? Well, okay. All right.
{\an8}Violet is sexy as hell,
but she has to bring something else.
[RuPaul] Ladies, gather round!
Soon you'll rehearse with Kym Johnson
from <i>Dancing with the Stars</i>.
And...
our very own Carson Kressley.
So, ladies, good luck and...
five, six, seven, eight,
don't fuck it up.
All right!
Cha-cha-cha, cha-cha-cha-cha,
cha-cha-cha, to me.
And...
-And good, we have visitors.
-Oh, hello!
-Hi, guys.
-Hi!
{\an8}So today I brought my really fantastic,
amazingly talented friend Kym Johnson.
{\an8}She taught me on <i>Dancing with the Stars</i>.
She's brought great assistants today.
-You're doing the Charleston Twerk?
-Yes.
-Then let's get started with the routine.
-Let's do it.
And so with tricks and stuff,
can you do the splits?
-I can split, flip.
-Can I see it?
-[Pearl] Oh, my God!
-[Kym] Give it to me.
Whoo! Oh! Amazing!
-Yes, Kennedy.
-[Kym] Oh, my goodness!
-You can't do that?
-No.
I'm not gonna dwell on the fact that
{\an8}Kennedy does a back handspring double axel
with a twist landing into a split
and I can't. I'll give them the energy
they've been asking for over and over.
-Grab ahold of his waist.
-Like this?
-Child's play!
-Walk it through.
-Try to keep your core really tight.
-[Pearl] Okay.
[Kym] In.
-[Carson] Pearl...
-[Kym] Yes.
-[Carson] <i>A little gangly.</i>
-Yes, she has to straighten those legs.
Her legs bent up in the air like that,
they weren't so attractive.
-Good luck with that.
-Mm-hmm.
-Pearl, have you twerked before?
-Never. [laughs]
-Never?
-If you can't twerk, shake your legs.
-Yeah.
-Like this?
Can we bring Ambrose out to show him?
-You wanna go hop, hop.
-See how cool that looks?
-No problem.
-Can you do that?
-Pop, pop, pop, pop.
-[Kym laughs]
Yeah, no, not so much.
As far as the choreography,
it's the technique that's lacking, so...
We got work to do, Miss Pearl.
-Hi!
-Hello!
{\an8}I feel really good going in with Katya.
We have a good grasp on the vibe
and the style so we're gonna work it out.
I'm going to need Ambrose to come in here.
He's the voguing expert.
One, two, three, four.
Open it up on five, six.
Touch your cheekbone, seven, eight.
Sharp to the front on one.
Three, four, five, six, and Madonna.
Seven, eight, one.
-Totally!
-[Katya laughs]
-[Kym] I know it seems simple but--
-No, we know it's not.
[Kym] Oh. [laughs]
We start the choreography and immediately,
I'm totally freaked out.
Okay, fuck! No, sorry.
-Yeah? Good?
-It's just...
It's a lot. It seems really complicated.
-Lunge, dip.
-Oh, shit, fuck.
-[Katya] Sorry.
-[Kym] No.
With choreography, I can get it,
if I have about three to four months.
So then we're gonna walk.
One, two, and flick. Good.
-[Katya] Okay.
-[Kym] Want to try together?
One, two, up and down.
So like you're hopping over something.
Ooh! Ooh!
Just hop over.
You'll get it. Left, flick.
But then... almost-ish.
Keep breathing, keep trying.
You're gonna get this.
Violet cannot get this goddamn leg flick.
It's just flick your fucking legs,
try to kick your butt, do-- [groans]
It's very frustrating.
-[Kym] Fast, fast, turn! Get down.
-[Carson] Yes!
-Come up. Come up!
-[Violet cries]
Face, face, face! Turn!
Up! Yep.
[Kym] Madonna, walk, walk!
Katya, is that terror or confusion
on your face?
It's a little bit of both.
It was just pandemonium.
This could really be a disaster,
or it could be absolutely incredible.
-[Carson] We have a medic. They'll be OK.
-[Kym laughs]
-You'll have your work cut out for you.
-Yeah, no shit.
-Hi.
-Hello!
{\an8}Our mash-up is country robot,
which is perfect
because this is like a kind of funny,
campy piece.
-So are you guys good dancers?
-No.
-I'm not.
-You look like you're worried.
Lord be with me!
You're gonna go bah, bah.
Keep your head to the front.
-Now, your head goes last.
-Oh, okay.
-Yes!
-[Kym] Yeah, how did that feel?
Terrible.
In the country we don't move like this.
We move nice and slow and fluid.
Slow being the key word.
And up, there, out, up. Feet together.
-[Kym] Almost. We'll get that.
-[Ginger] Hey, girl!
Ginger.
-How's it going?
-I'm okay.
-Yeah?
-I'm not in meltdown mode yet.
-I'm okay.
-Okay.
Let's try the country two-step.
One, two, three. One, two, three. Flick.
-Right, left, right, right, left, right.
-Good!
-Very nice.
-Very nice, then...
You're gonna jump off.
Oh, God!
-Put your left arm around her shoulder.
-[Ginger] Don't lean back.
[Trixie] I do yoga, I got it.
-I do frozen yogurt.
-[Kym laughs]
I look at Trixie like:
"I hope you've been working out, girl.
I'm a delicate flower. You're lifting me."
[Ginger] All right.
[Kym] One... oh, oh, oh!
No, no, no. Sorry.
Maybe a little more graceful.
-One, two, three--
-Ooh! I'm sorry.
-Ginger, is your insurance up to date?
-[laughter]
-Thanks, Obama.
-I won't drop her.
This is a chance for the judges to go:
"Trixie lifted Ginger. It was awesome."
So we jump one...
No matter what I do, I won't drop Ginger.
-[Kym] Oh, and arms...
-[Ginger] Aah!
-I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
-Are you OK?
And then I dropped Ginger.
-Just rehearse like crazy.
-[Kym] Yeah.
We will, absolutely.
{\an8}[Pearl] Oh, just another day
in the workroom, girl.
{\an8}For this challenge, we have to dance
in pairs dressed as half man, half woman.
With only six of us, it's a one
in three chance you'll lip-sync.
So it's a different air in the room today.
-I did not sleep at all last night.
-Really?
No. I was literally up all night
doing the robot.
I have no clue what I'm doing, girl.
I'm like, boom, boom, boom, boom.
Yeah. I'm not a dancer either.
It's all about selling it.
It'll be who performs their song best.
I'm just afraid I'm gonna look like
Honey Boo Boo meets Rosie O'Donnell.
{\an8}My biggest challenge with choreography
{\an8}is going to be selling it as a sexy woman.
[Ginger] <i>I don't see myself like that.</i>
I am trying to pull everything together,
because I don't want to go home
and I don't want to set Trixie up
for failure.
I'm exhausted.
I thought it'd be some cha-cha shit.
But this is like legit-ass choreo.
-Lifts and dips...
-Lifts and dips.
Running around. You know what?
-It's really a pleasure to work with you.
-Oh! [laughs]
{\an8}Violet is more likable than I thought.
I admire her confidence.
I'm ten years older than the bitch,
and I don't have that yet.
When you picked me, I thought:
"This will be interesting."
-And it's been so much fun.
-Yeah, I'm trying to be nice.
-[Ginger] Why start now, girl?
-[laughter]
{\an8}The old lady brigade is still kicking,
honey, and talking shit.
[music]
[RuPaul laughs]
Welcome to the main stage
of <i>Rupaul's Drag Race</i>.
A girl who always clears the dance floor,
Michelle Visage.
{\an8}The thigh's the limit, baby.
Take it all the way up.
{\an8}Style superstar and <i>Dancing</i>
<i>with the Stars</i> alum, Carson Kressley.
How did dance class go yesterday?
There were some good dancers and some...
how shall we say?
-Not so really good dancers.
-Oh, good. I can't wait.
{\an8}The always hilarious Rachael Harris.
Hey, Kitty Girl.
{\an8}Hello, milady, how are you?
-I hear you're a fan of the show.
-I am a big fan of The Snatch Game.
-We're big fans of your snatch game, too.
-Oh, thank you.
-Your snatch game is on point, girl.
-It is. It is. It's no joke.
Who's the boss, applesauce?
Alyssa Milano!
{\an8}-Dear Lord, you are gorgeous.
-Aw, thank you!
-Hey, are you having a boy or a girl?
-Could you tell I'm pregnant?
I'm having a girl.
And I think we're gonna name her RuPaula.
Oh, my goodness, I love it!
This week our queens had to prance
in half man, half queen drag.
First, they're gonna shake their thing
on the runway.
Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best woman win!
{\an8}-Up first, Pearl. Oh, what a pretty lady!
-[Carson] Oh, hello, sir.
[RuPaul] Oh, yes.
Meet Pearl's better half.
[Rachael] I'm sorry. Is that
Justin Timberlake meets Keira Knightley?
-[RuPaul] Yeah.
-[Rachael] Wow.
<i>For my masculine side, I painted</i>
<i>on more beard than I'm capable of growing.</i>
<i>For my female side,</i>
<i>I'm going for a classic roaring '20s look.</i>
<i>Both of them are gorgeous.</i>
[Carson] -I got mixed feelings about this.
[RuPaul] -Do you, really?
[RuPaul] Drag queen has two faces.
{\an8}-[RuPaul] Kennedy Davenport.
-[Carson singing] Half a dream girl.
[laughter]
[RuPaul] Goodness, that's Peaches &amp; Herb!
<i>I'm feeling very </i>Save the Last Dance<i> fish,</i>
<i>Vanessa Williams gussied all up.</i>
<i>And then turn around and give them Bubba.</i>
<i>[laughs] I'm feeling it, honey.</i>
[RuPaul] She's really got personality,
split personality.
-[Alyssa] And a great ass.
-[Carson] I think it's half-assed.
[RuPaul] She done already done have
herses, and hises.
{\an8}[RuPaul] Trixie Mattel.
{\an8}She's country, and he's rock and roll.
[Carson] Half Dwight Yoakam,
half Loretta Lynn.
<i>My gentleman character loves Jesus,</i>
<i>his pickup truck, and his girl.</i>
<i>And when I turn to my girl's side</i>
<i>in my square dancing dress, I'm adorable.</i>
<i>I'm giving them hoedown...</i>
<i>Instead of "that hoe fell down."</i>
[Michelle] Is that a gun in his pocket
or is he just happy to see himself?
[RuPaul] You could tell this ain't
her first time at the rodeo.
{\an8}-[RuPaul] Ginger Minj.
-[Rachael] What's up, Sass?
{\an8}[RuPaul] Ooh, bam!
<i>I am stomping down this runway</i>
<i>like a Clydesdale in heat.</i>
<i>Honey, I'm serving you</i>
<i>some country girl realness.</i>
<i>Queen of the double-wide trailer.</i>
<i>I flip to my boy side</i>
<i>and I'm trying to pick up Michelle Visage.</i>
[Carson] Two tastes
that taste great together.
[RuPaul] Loretta Lynn and Conway Twitty.
{\an8}[RuPaul] Violet Chachki.
{\an8}-[Carson] Drama.
-[Michelle] Erté.
{\an8}-[Rachael] Ooh, very stunning.
-[RuPaul] He missed a spot shaving.
<i>I'm feeling like a mamacita.</i>
<i>I'm feeling like a Spanish prostitute.</i>
<i>And then, bam, Pablo.</i>
<i>I nailed the look, but what else is new?</i>
[Michelle] "You must pay the rent!"
"I can't pay the rent!"
[laughter]
-[Alyssa] They'd have cute babies.
-[Michelle] They would.
{\an8}[RuPaul] Katya.
She comes from a drag house divided.
-[Michelle] Meet me halfway.
<i>-On one side, flamenco flapper</i>
<i>and on the other, her abusive boyfriend.</i>
<i>My feminine side is very coy and demure,</i>
<i>and then, bam, it's a man!</i>
[Carson] It'll be a split decision.
-[RuPaul] Yeah.
-[Rachael] Oh, nice.
Let's get this disco ball rolling!
Now, prance, I said!
[music]
I'm in the Form Decor Lounge,
the queens are ready to let you have it.
<i>First up, doing the Charleston Twerk,</i>
<i>it's Kennedy Davenport and Pearl!</i>
[Charleston music]

Back in the Form Decor Lounge,
we're getting ready for a hoedown.
[Michelle] <i>Dancing the country robot,</i>
<i>it's Ginger Minj and Trixie Mattel.</i>

[Michelle] <i>Doing the tango vogue,</i>
<i>it's Violet Chachki and Katya.</i>

[tango music]
[applause]
Oh, my gag. Amazing job, ladies.
Tonight, you're making our job
incredibly difficult.
That being said,
it's time for the judges' critiques.
First up, Pearl.
Okay, Pearl, you're a good-looking man
and a good-looking woman.
You're like a bisexual's dream date.
The dancing,
you are a little rhythmically challenged.
The stiffness helped with the Charleston,
not so great with the twerking.
Fantastic. What you lacked in technique,
you made up for in enthusiasm.
-It's clear you were having a good time.
-Yeah.
-That speaks volumes.
-What was it like working with Kennedy?
Oh, my God, we're probably the two most,
kind of "flazay da" sort of like...
-The most what?
-"Flazay da" sort of...
Are you saying <i>laissez-faire</i>?
I think he's trying to say blasé
and add la-di-da on the end.
-But he said "flazay da."
-Yeah, a little "flazay da".
Well, I asked
because I have an Aunt Flazay Da.
-All right, thank you, Pearl.
-Thank you.
Next up, Kennedy Davenport.
For the dancing, a bit of the energy
was a little laid-back.
-I felt that it looked effortless.
-Thank you.
I love the wheelbarrow move.
That's how I got pregnant.
I had a great time watching.
-Next up, Trixie Mattel.
-Howdy, y'all.
Trixie, I think you definitely nailed
the runway look
and you kept true to Trixie with that
dangling bottom eyelash, so...
-It's a bit campy. Obviously.
[Trixie] -Yeah.
-Just a bit.
-Just a little.
Your dancing was technically strong.
Maybe not so much robot,
but you nailed the country.
Next up, Ginger Minj.
I loved the attempt to butch up
when you showed the guy side.
-I coached her. I coached her.
-And it shows.
The dancing this week,
it seemed off for you.
Not that you were bad, 'cause you weren't.
Um...
This was so hard for me.
I was at my full mental capacity
because it was so out of my comfort zone.
-Where are the emotions coming from?
-My biggest fear is dancing in public.
Because I feel people are going
to judge me poorly
for how I look and the way things jiggle.
I didn't know any of your insecurities
and you could not tell.
-You were absolutely magnificent.
-I second that.
We just see this beautiful,
talented person that's having a good time.
All right, thank you.
-Next up, Katya.
-I loved seeing you with this black hair.
We're used to seeing Katya
in red hair and blond hair.
We haven't gotten the black fantasy yet.
-Ooh, girl.
-Well, I've had it many a time,
-but not from you, Katya.
-When I saw you come out on the runway,
I was like: "Oh!" You were coquettish.
And then when you turned,
and I mean this as a compliment,
it was very, like, hot, douchey guy.
-That is amazing.
-All right, "V" is for Violet.
-You were an absolute work of art.
-Thank you.
You are so exquisite.
Like, I kind of want to be you.
-Am I weird?
-Have your baby first.
-Maybe I'm gonna name my baby after you.
-RuPaula Chachki.
[Alyssa] There you go, perfect.
Technically, your tango,
you had just the right tone for it.
On some extensions, you got really low.
It was very tango, congratulations.
Thank you.
Thank you. While you untuck backstage,
the judges and I will deliberate.
Now, just between us dance moms.
What the hell are we gonna do?
They were all good,
but we must choose the best and the worst.
We're gonna start with Pearl.
Of all of them,
Pearl made the hottest guy.
And she exuded confidence.
We usually see a zombie.
She's crossed over this line now
and she's really in the game.
I love that aloof attitude that she had.
Very "flazay da".
[RuPaul] <i>Kennedy Davenport.</i>
-Did you get a look at her ass?
-[Michelle] Oh, yeah!
Must be jelly 'cause jam don't shake.
Kennedy was shining tonight.
She clearly was the strength in the duo.
The dancing was the con.
I know you guys think it was very strong.
There wasn't enough razzle-dazzle for me.
-But I liked that it looked effortless.
-Really?
-She was on fire!
-She looked bored.
She was a great twerker,
but there wasn't much energy in her dance.
-[RuPaul] <i>Trixie Mattel.</i>
-I might be alone in this one
but I had a really good time with Trixie.
I don't have the same enthusiasm
that Michelle has for Trixie.
For me, honestly,
it just left me a little like "meh."
I didn't see that glint in her eye
of, like, "I really want this".
-[RuPaul] <i>Ginger Minj.</i>
-I think her look on the runway was okay.
-[Michelle] <i>The girl half wasn't exciting.</i>
-Let's discuss them as a pair.
I know you're in a difficult position
and you're splitting hairs, but...
watching that performance, it felt jokey.
It just wasn't my cup of tea.
-[RuPaul] <i>Katya.</i>
-She looked gorgeous on the runway
but her boy side was just kind of "meh."
-Blah.
-Katya's choreography was very correct.
When I said that she was hot,
douchey as the male,
it impressed me
that she was able to go that masculine.
-[RuPaul] <i>Violet Chachki.</i>
-Tonight, her runway was the best for me.
-What artistry!
-[RuPaul] <i>It took my breath away.</i>
-[Michelle] <i>Yes.</i>
-She's a little bit like Bambi.
Very pretty, big eyes,
but when you ask her to move, it's like--
-Like Taylor Swift in heels.
-Yes.
But the tango's not an easy dance.
So for her to pull off what she did,
I think she did a great job.
Silence! I've made my decision.
I think.
Bring back my girls.
Welcome back, ladies.
Based on your prancing and runways,
I've made some decisions.
And this week, I'm judging you in pairs.
Pearl and Kennedy Davenport,
we flipped for your flappers.
But were you one step
behind the competition?
Trixie Mattel and Ginger Minj
took us for a roll in the hey, girl, hey.
But was it a barn burner?
Katya and Violet Chachki.
You two make a striking pair.
But could this be your last tango?
Katya and Violet.
Condragulations.
You're the winner of this challenge.
I'm so fucking happy! You fucking bitch!
Sorry. I'm sorry.
[RuPaul] You've each won an original gown
from Mountbatten Concepts
and a gift card from Klein Epstein Parker,
made-to-measure suits.
You may step to the back of the stage.
{\an8}Katya and I won, and I cannot believe it.
Actually, yeah, I can.
Pearl and Kennedy...
You're safe.
You may join the other girls.
Trixie and Ginger, I'm sorry,
my dears, but you are up for elimination.
{\an8}It is breaking my heart,
having to go against Trixie.
But as much as I love her,
I am here to win.
Two queens stand before me.
Ladies,
this is your last chance to impress me
and save yourself from elimination.
The time has come...
for you to lip-sync...
for your life!
[Trixie] <i>I have déjà vu.</i>
{\an8}It sucks to do this again
but I'll sell it anyway, so let's do it.
Good luck
and don't fuck it up!
[Ginger] <i>I am so in this moment.</i>
<i>I'm feelin' this song.</i>
[Ginger] <i>You better believe</i>
<i>I have brought it.</i>
[Trixie] <i>The last time I lip-synced,</i>
<i>I went home. Fuck that.</i>
<i>I'm channelling all my energy</i>
<i>into this performance.</i>
[cheers]
Come through!
Ladies, I've made my decision.
Ginger Minj, shantay, you stay.
Thank you for seeing
something in me that...
makes you want me
to go a little bit further.
You may join the other girls.
Trixie Mattel,
you put the "try" in "country",
and I am so glad we got to see
more of your talents.
-Now, sashay away.
-Thank you so much.
[Trixie] <i>Getting eliminated twice</i>
<i>is just as fun as the first time.</i>
If they ask me back,
I'll stay home and play video games.
That's enough for me. That's a wrap.
{\an8}My fierce five queens, condragulations.
{\an8}And remember, if you can't love yourself,
how the hell you gonna love somebody else.
{\an8}-Can I get an amen up in here?
-Amen!
{\an8}All right, now let the music play.
{\an8}["Fly Tonight" playing]


{\an8}You're invited to the first annual DESPYS.
{\an8}-Pearl, I want you to up the ante.
-Well, you told me I had no personality.
{\an8}That doesn't give me confidence.
{\an8}I'm just over this bullshit.
We want to welcome... welcome you
to the first annual Despy Awards.
And the award
for the shadiest shade goes to...
Violet Chachki.
The winner is Max and Pearl.
[applause]
-Kandy Ho, shantay, you stay.
-Thank you.
Mrs. Kasha Davis, sashay away.
{\an8}-Whoo! Shit.
-[Pearl] Single digits!
{\an8}"Love to the moon &amp; back, MKD."
{\an8}They're putting me on the bottom
so that I can take out the other girls.
{\an8}-I took out the two oldest ones.
-[laughter]
{\an8}Ru gave me another chance.
{\an8}So I'm just gonna have to go crazy,
untuck, and act a fool.
So who is everybody
that had won in the categories?
-I won!
-Me.
The award that was so unexpected
was Violet.
Shady lady!
How do you feel about winning that award?
-You know, I was kind of expecting it.
-[Miss Fame] Yeah, me too.
{\an8}People think I'm mean, but everything
I've done comes from humor or truth.
I want you to know that I am gonna work
on the way I come across.
I won't hold my breath.
[laughter]
-Well, congrats to Max and Pearl.
-[Ginger] Yes, congratulations!
Girl, how do you feel?
'Cause I know you were having a meltdown.
-No, I was not feeling it today.
-I could tell.
[Miss Fame] <i>I was not expecting</i>
<i>Pearl to pull through that strong.</i>
{\an8}I'm frustrated, I'm grateful to be here,
and she's like "Fuck this. I'm out."
The energy is so toxic. I can't
shower positive energy on that shit.
I don't even want it near me.
-[engines]
[RuPaul] <i>The winner receives a year supply</i>
<i>of Anastasia Beverly Hills Cosmetics</i>
<i>and a cash prize of $100,000.</i>
<i>With extra-special guest judges</i>
<i>Merle Ginsberg and Ariana Grande.</i>
-Yes, ma'am, pam.
-My god.
[Jaidynn] We're back. [laughs]
[Katya] And then there were nine.
If you had to have sex
with one other queen in this room...
-Who would it be?
-[all] Oh, my god.
{\an8}[Max] I'm opting out.
{\an8}These girls are all so vulgar.
I mean, they're all very sexual.
-Can I pick more than one?
-[laughter]
We'd probably all pick Katya
because she won Meatiest Tuck.
Who is the top,
and who's the bottom in sex?
[Max] We're not talking about sex.
Max wasn't having it, darling.
[Violet] Girl, calm down.
[siren blares]
[Max] Thank gracious.
[RuPaul] <i>She done already</i>
<i>done have herses.</i>
-<i>Hey, queens.</i>
-[all] Hi.
<i>A lace front wig has a front and a back.</i>
<i>But there are three sides to every story:</i>
<i>yours, mine, and the T, Miss Thing.</i>
<i>And sometimes</i>
<i>the truth is 100% unbeweaveable.</i>
Something with wigs.
[Ginger]
Girl, and now I can't use my black spray.
-Hello, hello, hello.
-[all] Hi, Ru.
Ladies, America's next drag superstar
needs to stay calm
and carry on no matter what pops up.
Oh, Pit Crew!
-[Max] Yay!
-[Katya] Wow!
[indistinct chatter]
Looks like the Pit Crew invited
some of their friends over for a playdate.
I'm gonna pass out.
[laughs]
{\an8}I'm taking in the buffet right now.
Every size and color.
It's like Epcot for the thirsty bitches.
For today's challenge, we're gonna play
a game called Monster in Your Pants.
[laughter]
Most of these men have a number tucked
inside their Justin Case underwear.
You call out a name, he reaches
into his drawers and whips it out.
You'll need to gobble up
as many points as possible.
But be careful, because one of you
bastards has a Monster in Your Pants.
If you pick the monster before you freeze
your points, you're out of the game.
All right, first up.
Come on over, Miss Fame.
[RuPaul]
The rest wait outside for your turn.
-Miss Fame, call out a name.
-I'm gonna go with Dick.
Everybody loves Dick. Ten!
-Ten points
-Yay! I'm gonna go with Jack.
-There it is.
-Joe.
-[buzzer]
-No!
Shoot!
-I'm gonna start with Fang.
-Nine!
We're off to a good start.
I think I'll go with Boo.
-[buzzer]
-[both] Oh!
Katya!
{\an8}I've no idea what the rules are.
I don't care what they are.
{\an8}Just, when do I get to blow them?
I can't say that?
{\an8}I can't say that either?
-Katya, call out a name.
-Okay.
-Dude.
-[RuPaul] Show us what you got.
Motherfucker! God. Son of a motherfucking
cunt whore bitch. The first time?
[RuPaul] The first time out?
I love me some BJ, but I'll go with Papi.
-[Ru] Two and a half.
-Rod. Come on, come on.
-Oh, Rod.
-Oh, no!
-BJ.
-Fang.
John.
[Ru] Oh, shoot!
-Rod.
-Nine!
-Mary.
-Eight and a half!
-Jack.
-Whip it out, Jack!
- Ooh, girl!
-I think I wanna freeze.
-You wanna freeze.
-Yes.
All right.
Pearl, this may be your chance
to finally get that necklace.
-Jack.
-Six and a half.
Fang.
-Nine!
-Yes!
-Who's talking to you?
-Pete.
Fuck you, Pete. Fuck you, Pete.
All right, time to get that blood
rushing right back up to your brains.
The one queen that inched
her way to victory is... Ginger Minj.
[cheers and applause]
{\an8}For this week's maxi challenge,
you'll act in the reenactment series
{\an8}#RuHollywoodStories.
{\an8}This week's episode,
Whatever Happened to Merle Ginsberg?
Y'all remember Merle? She sat
by my side for the first two seasons.
I could almost see her now.
So soft, so wise, so blurry.
In teams of three, you'll portray
Merle, myself, and Michelle Visage,
as you reenact our very different versions
of what ha-happened?
Ginger Minj, you won the mini challenge
so you get to pick your two teammates.
Kennedy Davenport and Katya.
And then you get to assign
the other two groups.
Max, Violet, and Kandy.
Ginger knows Violet and Kandy
have not been the strongest.
Regardless,
I am gonna whip 'em into shape.
And that means team three
is Miss Fame, Jaidynn, and Pearl.
God damn it, me and Pearl again.
I'm frustrated.
Now listen, I need you to break
this mystery wide open.
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.
You wanna roll through it so we get
the hang of it and don't mess up?
What if we were doing
like a three-way scissor?
Or like a triangle toenail clipping?
Or like a toenail polishing thing?
Okay.
{\an8}Pearl was having a good time.
"What if we did this?"
I'm like, "What if we learn our lines?"
What I would like to do,
just kind of start acting stuff out
so it gets in our brains and stuff.
I ain't trying to look a fool again and go
home 'cause you wanna do a stunt.
'Cause I just don't wanna bomb this,
'cause we gotta win.
We gotta have fun because there's nothing
to this but being completely nonsensical.
{\an8}For our maxi challenge this week,
we will reenact the Ru Hollywood Story of,
What the Hell Ever Happened
to Merle Ginsberg?
-Okay, so how do we feel about characters?
-I don't know.
{\an8}I'm a little bit over
these acting group challenges.
{\an8}I'm sick of memorizing lines and lyrics,
and working with other people.
I'm not really comfortable playing Ru.
-Do you want Merle?
-I was comfortable with Michelle.
-'Cause I could do the Jersey thing.
-The Merle--
That one's off for me
because I do not know nothing about her.
The attitude shouldn't be,
"I don't know how to do this,"
or "I'm uncomfortable with it."
They need to be positive and excited.
It's like...
Good-bye, Merle?
But I'm not going anywhere.
-Ru and I are great friends.
-Well, I'm her best friend, okay?
And I'm supposed to be a judge here.
You got it, Merly girl?
{\an8}Ginger is gonna be the evil villain,
which is perfect,
{\an8}because she's playing it
like Ginger Minj as Danny Devito
as Tony Soprano as The Fonz
as Michelle Visage.
Hey, Merle, how's my cake?
Don't you want sprinkles?
So I have to find a way
to not get overshadowed by Ginger.
-Hello, hello, hello!
-[all] Hi!
In a moment, you'll meet with Ross Mathews
who will be directing your Ru-enactments.
And tomorrow, for the runway,
category is... Death Becomes Her.
-Now a warning?!
-[laughter]
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.
{\an8}-Ginger, Kennedy, Katya, how are you?
-[all] Good. Good.
-Who's gonna play RuPaul?
-Me.
-It's just a joke, honey.
-[laughter]
-I figured that out.
-[Kennedy] Right.
You're doing Merle's story.
-I'm ready.
-Okay, places!
-Action!
-Good-bye, Merle?
But I'm not going anywhere.
Ru and I are great friends.
Well, I'm her best friend, see?
Ru, I brought you a cake.
All the brothers will like-- I'm sorry.
It's all right, honey.
All the brothers will wanna eat this cake.
Speaking of,
I have to go speak to the new Pit Crew.
Cut!
That was a little rocky.
Kennedy's RuPaul
was the weirdest fucking thing ever.
You have job security
for the rest of your life!
That was like...
{\an8}I am just sending up
a silent prayer at this point
<i>that we do not get dragged down</i>
<i>into the bottom because of her.</i>
-Hello, team two.
-Hello.
-Hi, Ross.
-Places!
Okay, ready.
-Max, this is how you see Merle?
-It's not how I see Merle.
-But it's Michelle's side of the story.
-So thought behind this performance.
-Oh, of course.
-Yeah, you are the Meryl Streep of drag.
-Action.
-You can have my job, tramp!
Because I'm taking RuPaul's!
What?!
Um, let's cut. So on your, "What?"
you should be like, "What?"
Upset about it, grab your drink,
take a sip to calm yourself down.
-Okay.
-[Ross] Right?
I'm supposed to hold a cake and a drink
while I do all of this?
No one said it was easy.
-Action!
-Stay away from my man!
Mother--
-Can I get my line?
-Mother does not play that.
-Mother does not play!
-That.
-Oh, play that.
-Play that.
-Action!
-Stay away from my man!
Mother does not play!
-That.
-Fuck.
Let's do it again.
Shit.
-Look at you.
-Hi, Ross Mathews.
-Your scene today is RuPaul's story.
-[Jaidynn] Yes.
-So a lot rests on your shoulders.
-I know.
Okay, let's get in positions.
Action.
You two are crazy!
I forgot my line!
{\an8}I got frustrated.
And then next thing you know...
Get the crazy one and...
I'm just forgetting all my lines.
RuPaul, my monkeys
made you this potato salad.
Yay, I love a strong--
I don't know the line.
Yay, I love emotional time travel movies
with a strong female lead.
Yay, I love a strong female lead.
I love a--
I'm so struggling right now, to be honest.
-What's the struggle?
-This is the toughest day I've had.
I like to be professional,
and this is just embarrassing for me.
-I hear you.
-I  want to do better than this.
And I'm hitting a wall.
I wanna talk real, I'm in a room of people
and this is a chance of a lifetime.
And I'm finding myself
having a conversation with myself.
{\an8}Miss Fame decides to stop everything.
Just say the fucking line!
I have not been to this place before
so I'm trying to...
-It's fine. Just be funny.
-I don't know what's better.
Should I not talk about my feelings
or should I just keep moving on?
Oh, my god. I feel like I'm dating you.
[Ross laughs]
-We'll talk later.
-We just gotta get through this scene.
{\an8}I don't want to disappoint
anybody that's believed in me.
I don't want to make RuPaul disappointed
that I'm here because I'm not producing,
'cause I care a lot about my success.
{\an8}-Let's do it. Let's do it, do it, do it.
-[Pearl] Let's get this party started.
{\an8}Our runway look is Death Becomes Her.
How would your drag character die?
Girl, that is open to interpretation.
I want to see what these bitches pull out.
{\an8}For my Death Becomes Her look,
I'm going to be--
{\an8}Gee, I don't know what I'm gonna be.
Maybe burned and...
I kind of morphosize into a glamazon,
but before that,
it's, like, a night of hooking.
[laughs]
Katya, how did your family feel
about doing drag?
They're amazing. I never had
to worry about it or feel self-conscious.
-Girl, I wish my mama would be like that.
-What's she like, Jaidynn?
Me and my mama are, like, best friends.
-But it's just kind of hard because--
-Of the drag?
Not really the drag thing.
It's just sexuality.
{\an8}I have not officially
come out to my family yet.
We just kind of ignore the issue.
They're okay with the drag,
but not with the gay?
They're not really okay with the drag.
They know I do it.
My mom kind of lets me know,
"No, you ain't going in that direction."
She'll send me a text like, "I'm grateful
that one day you'll find you a wife."
It's hard because I love my family,
and my biggest fear is being disowned.
-Yeah.
-[Violet] And that's a real fear.
-It's, like, a serious fear.
-[Jaidynn] Yeah.
I think it may change my relationship
with my brothers, my mom,
and that's what I'm scared of most.
And that's the reason why I just...
stay to myself.
I'm sorry.
I don't want to live without my family.
I love my family too much.
-You know what I'm saying?
-Totally.
It's just crazy to not be able
to be your authentic self.
Even in your home.
And it's either,
I'll just live my life and marry a woman
and do what my family wants me to do
and be unhappy, or I can do me.
-So it's one of the two.
-Well then, do you and be happy.
[sighs] It's just a complicated thing.
In the end,
I just want to be accepted for who I am.
And I want people to know
that gay is okay. [sighs]
[RuPaul laughs]
Welcome to the main stage
of <i>RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
{\an8}-Merle Ginsberg, OMG!
-Ru, my world's been empty without you.
-Did my restraining order expire?
-[laughs]
{\an8}And, Michelle Visage.
Watch your back, honey.
No, seriously, watch your back.
Super judge, Ross Mathews,
what was it like directing my girls?
{\an8}Oh, I was so good at directing,
I kind of gave myself a Woody Allen.
{\an8}-[laughs]
-Hey.
{\an8}-And my everything, Ariana Grande.
-This is the best day of my life.
{\an8}-I'm not lying.
-So glad you're here.
Thank you.
This week we challenged our queens
to Ru-enact the Mystery of Merle Ginsberg.
Tonight they're ready to murder the runway
in their Death Becomes Her ensembles.
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.
{\an8}-[RuPaul] Katya.
-[Merle] Something seems fishy here.
[Ross]
I think we're gonna need a bigger boat.
[Katya] <i>I'm summoning up</i>
<i>my best Tara Reid in Sharknado.</i>
<i>I've got the stringy, blond hair,</i>
<i>and I'm feeling the shark week fantasy.</i>
-[Merle] Both have fabulous mouths.
-[Ross] Yes.
{\an8}-[Michelle] And both unhinge at the jaw.
-[RuPaul] Ginger Minj.
{\an8}-Looks like she suffered a grizzly death.
-[Michelle] Oh.
[Ginger]
<i>I am serving you baby bear realness.</i>
<i>I give a little spin. I strike a pose.</i>
<i>I give a little growl.</i>
-[Merle] Somebody's got their claws done.
-[RuPaul] She's bringing bear back.
[Merle] You go, growl.
{\an8}[RuPaul]
LaGuardia Newark, Kennedy Davenport.
- Kennedy Fried Chicken.
- Is she a chicken or a horse?
[Merle] Giddyap, girl.
[Kennedy] <i>After a night of hooking,</i>
<i>I got attacked, thrown in the fire</i>
<i>and crystallized.</i>
<i>So I come out</i>
<i>a fierce glamazon drag queen, honey.</i>
[RuPaul] A morality tale:
Do not go to Tijuana for plastic surgery.
[Merle] No.
{\an8}-[RuPaul] Max.
-[Ariana] Pretty.
{\an8}[Merle] The ghost of drag present.
[Max] <i>I'm doing a jilted lover</i>
<i>that's stuck in purgatory as a ghost</i>
<i>because she committed suicide</i>
<i>by cutting out her own heart. It's tragic.</i>
[RuPaul]
A little club soda'll take that right out.
-[Merle] That's a heart-stopping look.
-[RuPaul] Organ donor realness.
{\an8}[RuPaul]
Kandy Ho. Queen of the damned.
[Merle] I vant to smell your veave.
[Kandy] <i>I am feeling fierce right now.</i>
<i>I'm just a sexy vampire.</i>
[RuPaul] I think she was fang banged
to death.
[Michelle] If she's lucky.
[Merle]
Kristen Stewart is eating her heart out.
{\an8}-[RuPaul] Miss Fame.
-[Michelle] Oh!
{\an8}-[RuPaul] What's running through her head?
-[Ariana] Living.
[Fame] <i>I've been captured by the bride</i>
<i>of the man that I had an affair with.</i>
<i>And bitch got me</i>
<i>with a blade through the skull.</i>
[Merle] She's got a splitting headache.
[RuPaul] The last time
I'll eat at Benihana.
{\an8}[RuPaul] Pearl. Oh!
{\an8}[Merle] My safe word is "whiplash."
[Michelle] Walking's difficult
with the new legs.
[Pearl] <i>I'm feeling like all of my bones</i>
<i>are gonna give out at any given moment</i>
<i>and some poor janitor</i>
<i>is gonna have to sweep up my cremains.</i>
[Ross] You should really stop
at the second face-lift.
It's quite enough.
[Michelle]
At least she had the ribs removed.
{\an8}-[RuPaul] Jaidynn Diore Fierce.
-[Michelle] Orange is the new drag.
[Merle] She's looking really ripped.
[Jaidynn] <i>I got in jail, and then I tried</i>
<i>to escape to go see my baby daddy.</i>
<i>And I didn't quite make it over the fence.</i>
[Ross] It's criminal to look that good.
[RuPaul] She rises from the dead
once a month to meet her parole officer.
{\an8}Violet Chachki. [gasps]
Oh, my God.
[Violet] <i>I'm numb from the waist down,</i>
<i>tuck included.</i>
<i>I really could die, bitch.</i>
<i>I'm giving you realness.</i>
[Merle]
She's got a smaller waist than Barbie.
[Ross]
Don't sneeze, honey. It's all gonna pop.
[Ariana] Amazing. Work!
Ladies, let's watch my favorite new show,
Ru Hollywood Stories.
First up, Merle's story.
{\an8}[RuPaul]
<i>Whatever happened to Merle Ginsberg?</i>
I'm Merle Ginsberg, and this is my story.
{\an8}[Merle] <i>I was at the craft service table</i>
<i>getting my morning martini,</i>
<i>and I spotted RuPaul and said,</i>
<i>"Hey, Rusy-Q,</i>
<i>I'm so glad to be back for Season 3."</i>
And RuPaul said, "Oh, Merly girl,
I could never do the show without you."
You have job security
for the rest of your life.
Little did I know that we were not alone.
[clears throat]
Oh, my God, you scared me.
I didn't see you there.
Not very observant for a judge, bitch.
Ru, I brought you a cake.
All of the brothers
will want to eat this cake.
Speaking of,
I need to say hey to the new Pit Crew.
[Katya] Good-bye, Merle?
But I'm not going anywhere
Ru and I are great friends.
Well, I'm her best friend, see?
And I'm supposed to be a judge here!
<i>Someone slipped something in my drink</i>
<i>because I could not believe</i>
<i>what happened next.</i>
But the surveillance camera
caught everything.
[grunting and screaming]
What in the name of La Toya Jackson
is going on here?
Merle fell and I think she bumped
that part of her brain.
Now she can't judge good drag from bad.
But we're supposed
to be shooting Season 3.
I guess I'll just have to take her place.
[laughs]
And that's how that devil bitch,
Michelle Visage, stole my job.
Next up, Michelle's story.
{\an8}[RuPaul]
<i>Whatever happened to Merle Ginsberg?</i>
I'm Michelle Visage,
and here's what really happened.
{\an8}<i>I was visiting the set during Season 3,</i>
<i>sippin' on my sizzurp,</i>
<i>and I noticed RuPaul more upset than ever</i>
<i>before, because Merle was saying,</i>
<i>"Ru, these earrings would look much better</i>
<i>on someone pretty, like me."</i>
-And Ru said something like...
-Stay away from my things.
And stay away from my man!
Mother does not play that!
And I was like, "This bitch?"
I had to step in.
-Hey, I brought us all a cake.
-[Kandy] How sweet.
Let me tell the boys.
Well, look at this little witch,
trying to steal my job!
-Of course not.
-You can have my job.
I'm taking RuPaul's!
Get ready for Merle Ginsberg's Drag Race.
[Michelle] <i>Someone slipped</i>
<i>something into my drink</i>
<i>because I couldn't believe</i>
<i>what happened next.</i>
But the surveillance camera
caught everything.
<i>And the next thing I remember,</i>
<i>Merle was trying to kill Ru!</i>
What in the name of Janice Dickinson
is going on here?
She was trying to kill you
and then take over the show.
Season 3 is coming, and I need a judge.
[gasps] Michelle, could you?
Then I said, reluctantly,
"If Ru needs me, then yes."
<i>"Yes, I will become a judge</i>
<i>on RuPaul's Drag Race."</i>
And that's why that devil bitch,
Merle Ginsberg, left the show.
Next up, my story.
{\an8}[RuPaul]
<i>Whatever happened to Merle Ginsberg?</i>
You know what my name is but, frankly,
this is how it really went down.
{\an8}<i>I was oiling up the Pit Crew</i>
<i>when Merle came over to me and said,</i>
<i>"What if the drag queens judge us</i>
<i>instead of us judging them?"</i>
<i>And I said, "Only Judy can judge me."</i>
And then Michelle showed up,
and she had no cake.
All she brought me
was some dried up, old, nasty muffins.
And they weren't even gluten-free.
Happy Hanukah, RuPaul. [laughs]
My monkeys made you the potato salad.
Yay, I love an emotional time travel movie
with a strong female lead.
You two should talk.
I have to get to the...
Pit Crew.
-A worm stole my credit card once.
-German tourists often wear sandals.
[RuPaul] <i>I wish somebody had slipped</i>
<i>something in my drink, Kennedy,</i>
<i>'cause what ha-happened next</i>
<i>was cray-cray.</i>
And, child, that surveillance camera
caught everything.
<i>Felt like I was in the middle of freaknik</i>
<i>in Miami, Florida.</i>
What in the name of Fantasia Barrino
is going on up in here?
Who are we gonna get to judge Season 3?
[crying]
Just grab the crazy one
and put her on the judges' panel.
-And then the Pit Crew said...
-"Which one's the crazy one?"
There you have it. That's how
that devil bitch, Michelle Visage,
replaced that devil bitch, Merle Ginsberg.
Hand to God, honey.
[laughter and applause]
[Miss Fame] <i>The video wasn't</i>
<i>as bad as I was expecting it to be.</i>
{\an8}I still don't know what the fuck I said.
{\an8}If you asked me to repeat a line,
I would not know any of them.
Ladies, I've made some decisions.
Ginger Minj, yours is the winning team.
-Yes!
-You are all safe.
But tonight on the runway,
one of you stole the show.
Katya, Condragulations.
You're the winner of this challenge.
You'll receive
a $2,000 gift card from Fabric Planet.
{\an8}Yes! I won a challenge! I am so excited.
Bodily fluid's spraying out
of every orifice.
Katya, Ginger, and Kennedy,
you may leave the stage.
[RuPaul]
Now it's time for the judges' critiques.
-[Ru] First up, Max.
-You as me?
I wasn't seeing it.
It was a little too masculine.
Max, I asked you for one thing.
What was it that I asked you for?
You asked me not to wear any gray hair.
I'm waiting, and I'm becoming impatient.
I couldn't disagree with Michelle more.
Gray hair is your thing and it's not bad.
Nobody's asking her to change,
just try something different.
-That's exactly what changing is.
-[laughs]
I love this look, because it told a story,
and it was scary but beautiful.
-You described Michelle.
-[laughs]
All right, up next, Violet Chachki.
Now, how many inches is your waist?
Either 18 or 19.
You might have been playing a dead person,
but we were living.
You as me, I'm not from Staten Island.
I am from New Jersey.
-What's the difference?
-We say our Rs, darling.
-It's a characterization, Michelle.
-'Cause I always talk like this, Ru!
-Like I'm Jackie Mason.
-All right, next up, Kandy Ho.
I am over the vampire thing.
I feel like it's a cliché now.
As Ru, the beard was back.
What was going on with the crazy hairline?
It was so stiff.
I didn't think you captured her at all.
All right, next up, Miss Fame.
How's your head?
It hurts.
I can barely hear inside this muff.
It's like a shell.
-She hasn't had any complaints yet.
-Thank you, Michelle.
Yesterday you had a mini breakdown on set.
What was going on?
It was self-sabotage.
My mouth is going and I can't shut up.
-I cannot stop my mouth.
-But I want you...
I want to be present
and get it out of the way.
I'm a sensitive,
heart on my sleeve person,
and I want to be able
to bring that to the panel.
-I want to show you that.
-But you have to learn to listen.
Because when I talk to you,
you're a bit ahead of what I'm gonna say.
The same with acting. You have to listen
so that you can respond properly.
I don't see what they are talking about.
I think you're fabulous.
-Thank you.
-All right, next up, Pearl.
Someone set their alarm clock
and finally woke up.
I definitely have shaken off
whatever was going on.
Talk about Death Becomes Her.
It feels like the old self died
and the new self has emerged.
And now we're gonna go
to you portraying me.
-What the fuck was that?
-[laughs]
I came alive
when I put that breastplate on.
-[Merle] It seems to work for everyone.
-Except for you.
Next up, Jaidynn Diore Fierce.
I got the convict,
'cause I might have dated a few in my day.
But looking at everybody,
I feel it's just a rung lower than them.
Yesterday was frustrating
because you didn't know the lines.
-Yeah.
-That bummed me out. I think you're good.
[RuPaul]
Thank you. We've heard enough.
While you untuck backstage,
the judges and I will deliberate.
Now, just between us squirrel friends,
what do you think? Let's start with Max.
She came out very goofy,
and I said, "Do you wanna fix that?"
And she said,
"No, this is Michelle's version of Merle."
Michelle, I can't believe
you would say Max is predictable.
-You don't know what she'll look like?
-No.
She'll have a white face,
gray hair, and a spot on her face.
As somebody who always wears
their hair the same, I identify with Max.
-Would you do gray hair?
-If it were in a ponytail.
[RuPaul] Violet Chachki.
I called her out on the comedy timing,
but that's just not her strong suit.
But to stand up there cinched like that.
That was amazing.
-I know, Ru, you've heard of Mr. Pearl.
-Yes.
The most famous corset maker in the world.
He has like a 16-inch waist.
I thought I'll never see a person
who looks like that.
-And tonight, we did.
-I miss us, Merle.
-I know, Ru. I do, too.
-So let's move on to Kandy Ho.
I feel like she's flat lined.
It was all wrong.
She was beautiful. I loved her movement.
But I don't find her memorable.
Miss Fame. Ross, I know
she had a little bit of a breakdown.
She actually timed out and said,
"Can I have a real moment here?"
I don't know. I love an emotional diva.
I just kind of relate to that.
[RuPaul]
Pearl has come a long way.
Her acting in the skit,
I really, really enjoyed it.
Have you and Michelle
ever made out in a vat of Jell-O?
-I would remember that.
-Is that what you're saying now in public?
Yeah, roll tape.
[RuPaul] Jaidynn Diore Fierce.
When I got to sit with her on the set,
there were these moments of good,
but to get there was so much work.
That might be okay
if you're doing dinner theater,
but on the stage of RuPaul's Drag Race,
it's just not gonna cut it.
All right, silence!
I've made my decision.
Bring back my ghouls.
Welcome back, ladies.
I've made some decisions.
Max. You're safe.
Thank you.
Pearl.
You're safe.
[mouths words] Thank you.
Kandy Ho,
you vamped it up on the runway,
but you didn't sink your teeth
into the challenge.
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
Violet Chachki.
You're safe.
Jaidynn Diore Fierce,
this week you failed to break out.
Miss Fame, you got stuck in your head,
and not just by a 12-inch steak knife.
Jaidynn...
My dear, I'm sorry,
but you're up for elimination.
{\an8}Lord, my heart is beating,
my feet are shaking,
<i>and these are not my dance heels.</i>
Miss Fame, you're safe,
and you may join the other girls.
Two queens stand before me.
Prior to tonight, you were asked
to prepare a lip-sync performance
of <i>Break Free</i> by Ariana Grande.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me
and save yourself from elimination.
The time has come...
...to lip-sync...
...for your life!
[Kandy] <i>Jaidynn has nothing on me</i>
<i>when it comes to lip-synching.</i>
Girl, mm-mm.
Good luck,
and don't fuck it up.
[Jaidynn]<i> I'm giving the judges</i>
<i>everything. Honey, I want this.</i>
<i>This is my dream.</i>
[Kandy] <i>I'm giving it everything I have.</i>
<i>I want the judges to see it right.</i>
{\an8}I am watching this lip sync
and getting my life.
<i>These girls are going for blood.</i>
<i>This's gonna be a nail-biter till the end.</i>
[cheers and applause]
[Ariana] Oh, my God.
[RuPaul laughs]
-[Michelle] Oh, God.
-Ladies, I've made my decision.
Jaidynn Diore Fierce, shantay, you stay.
-[cries] Thank you.
-You may join the other girls.
Miss Ho, you came from Puerto Rico,
but now the whole world
is gonna have a Kandy Crush.
Now...
sashay away.
[applause]
[Kandy] <i>It's a bittersweet moment.</i>
<i>I'm not gonna lie.</i>
<i>I wanted to stay longer,</i>
<i>but I'm going to Puerto Rico</i>
and rub it against other queens' faces,
because I was here and you weren't.
{\an8}Condragulations, ladies, and remember,
if you can't love yourself,
{\an8}how you gonna love somebody else?
Can I get an amen in here?
{\an8}-[all] Amen!
-All right, now let the music play.
{\an8}[Ru] Bye!


{\an8}<i>Previously on RuPaul's Drag Race...</i>
{\an8}Category is... Hello Kitty.
{\an8}Kennedy is a catsuit queen.
{\an8}-Do you know how to make one?
-I don't.
{\an8}I don't know what to do with all this.
{\an8}Listen. The clock is running out.
{\an8}Category is Hello Kitty BFF Realness.
I love this look. I'm having waist envy.
Condragulations,
you are the winner of this challenge.
Kennedy, this look
could be more adventuresome.
Katya's eleganza.
I did not like it at all,
and there's no way Hello Kitty is allowed
to hang out with this Russian hooker.
Kennedy Davenport, shantay, you stay.
Katya, sashay away.
{\an8}[tense music]
{\an8}Walking into the workroom without Katya
{\an8}doesn't feel right.
"If you need me,
you know where to find me:
the dumpster out back."
Oh!
She's one of a kind.
I'm so sad to see her go.
And I can't believe
I'm crying on fucking TV.
Congratulations, Miss Violet. Next.
[laughs]
Kennedy Davenport,
your Hello Kitty was a "Hell no" kitty.
This is not a sewing competition.
You knew you had to sew,
and what the fuck did you do?
Girl, so what?  I'm not a seamstress.
I don't know how to sew.
But no other bitch has been able
to sing or act like me.
Oh, my God!
I'm in a pressure cooker.
The heat is on, and eventually,
it's just going to explode.
I need a smoke and a nap.
[engines revving up]
[RuPaul] <i>The winner receives</i>
<i>a one-year supply</i>
<i>of Anastasia Beverly Hills cosmetics</i>
<i>and a cash prize of $100,000!</i>
{\an8}[tires screeching]
{\an8}-Eh?
-Oh, my God!
{\an8}It feels awesome to walk
into the workroom and it just be top four.
{\an8}-Where's everybody else?
-Bitch, they gone.
{\an8}Thank God!
{\an8}-Hello, hello, hello!
-Hey, Michelle!
{\an8}[Michelle] Condragulations, ladies.
For your final four challenge,
you'll be starring with RuPaul
in the official music video
{\an8}for "Born Naked." #BornNaked.
{\an8}In a few moments, you'll be dancing
with choreographer Candis Cayne,
and then you'll be acting
with director Matthew Anderson.
-Yay!
-I hope you're hungry,
because you're each invited
to one last meal with mama Ru.
This is definitely not a time
to be half-steppin' it, ladies,
because tomorrow,
one of you will be eliminated
and edited out of the final video.
That's some shady shit.
Bitch, I'ma turn into Effie White.
This is <i>Dreamgirls</i>,
and I am telling you, I am not going.
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.
-Hello, girls.
-Oh, my God! Hi!
{\an8}Today the choreography is gonna be
a throwback to the '80s strong woman look,
like Pat Benatar, Sheena Easton.
Okay, you start faced forward,
legs like this.
What makes me nervous
about this music video is the dancing.
It looks like one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.
But that won't get
the best of me this time.
-Ginger, that looked great.
-Thank you.
[Candis] We're gonna move on.
Step, touch, step, touch,
step, touch. Violet,
in this, you need to get
a little bit lower.
Think '80s Cheryl Tiegs dancing.
I was born in '92.
That's no excuse.
Don't get frustrated. You have the look.
Just don't psych yourself out.
It's just steps.
{\an8}[Kennedy] <i>Violet...</i>
{\an8}girl, bye.
[light jazzy music]
[blender whirring]
-Kennedy, darling. Sit down.
-Hello.
[RuPaul] Are you hungry?
I'm juicing now, you know.
-This was your first time auditioning.
-Yes, m'am.
-And what took you so long?
-I was always working and struggling.
I just didn't have the time, really.
And then, like, after losing my dad,
it was like,
"You know what? It's time now."
My dad passed in October 2013,
and it's still so fresh to me.
<i>We didn't see eye-to-eye at first,</i>
but we ended up
having the best relationship.
He came to my pageants,
and we was always talking.
He told me, "You need to go
on <i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i>."
By him passing, it was, like, it's time.
I want to do it for my dad.
Wow.
And what would winning
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i> mean to you?
Hoo-whee. Everything has been a struggle.
I've always been a caregiver,
because my sister
is severely mentally retarded,
and I had to step in.
<i>I took part in raising my sister.</i>
<i>I bathed her, I washed her clothes.</i>
I had big responsibilities
as a child myself.
<i>And it's repeating itself,</i>
<i>because since I lost my dad,</i>
now I'm her guardian.
I...
I never ask God why. I just take it on.
And I feel like being on here
and have made it this far is my reward.
It's an amazing story,
and you've done so well.
-I am so proud of you.
-Thank you.
I loved watching you work through it
and make it happen.
I will see you out there.
That's right, honey. I'm just saying.
-I.J.S!
-[both laugh]
I had fun actually doing the choreography.
I want to do well and go to the top three,
so I'm excited to do it.
I'm so excited. I mean,
learning choreo is not my strong suit,
but I think I've got it.
But you were having trouble
with the choreo,
and you've also been clocked
for your acting.
Does that scare you at all?
Really, bitch?
Not really. I've pushed through it
every single time.
But now you can't just push through.
With me with the dancing, I know
I have to nail it or I'm gonna go home.
What's your approach other than--
I'll enjoy that I'm in top four,
and I'm here to win it.
Any issues I'm having going into it,
I'm gonna work it out,
like I've been doing the entire season.
Get over yourself.
I've been over you since you walked in.
Keep 'em coming, girl. Keep 'em coming.
-Hi.
-Ginger Minj.
Who is your ally back home?
Do you have any allies in the family?
It's a cliché for every gay boy to say,
"My mom is my personal hero,"
but she's amazing.
-Are your parents together?
-No.
Do you have
a relationship with your father?
When I was 14 going into 15, he left us
for his high school girlfriend. And...
-I didn't talk to him for years.
-Wow.
What do you want him to know about you
that you think he doesn't know?
That's a tricky question.
I don't think he knows a lot about me.
I don't think that my father has...
I'm sorry.
My entire life, I have felt like
I didn't even know who my father was.
So how could he know anything about me?
{\an8}Growing up, I was so tormented in my life
{\an8}that the only way I could deal
was to make jokes
{\an8}and use humor to cover it all up.
My relationship with my father
has shaped me
into the human being that I am today.
No matter all the bullshit
that's happened in the past,
I just hope that...
-he's proud of me.
-Listen, I'm so proud of you.
-You are lovely, beautiful, and talented.
-That means the world to me.
Here, at least take one of these
for the ride home.
-Oh, thank you.
-I'll see you out there.
Muah! Bye.
-So whatcha wearing, pumpkin?
-I don't know.
I don't know if I want to do a gown.
It seems so, like, typical.
-Like, not enough?
-Yeah.
{\an8}I have tons of gorgeous dresses,
and I don't want to blend in
with these pageant girls.
How many times
have you gotten fucked in this?
Once or twice.
[whispering] What are they doing?
[whispering] Trying on their shit.
While Kennedy and I completely appreciate
what these kids are trying to do
with their modern take on drag,
old-school is the only school, honey.
They're in the corner playing dress-up
like it's kindergarten.
It's a walk-off.
[Pearl humming]
[whispering] Shut the fuck up...
{\an8}Ginger and Kennedy's final runway looks
are a mystery
{\an8}except for huge, gigantic
pageant girl hair.
<i>They're competing</i>
<i>for who can have the biggest hair </i>
on top of who is
America's next drag superstar.
All this bullshit
and they pulling out sleepers.
It will be comfortable
for their plane ride home.
{\an8}This is your time to make a statement.
<i>And the shit you pulling out...</i>
Girl...
-Hi.
-Violet, darling.
So when you auditioned for the show,
how far did you imagine yourself coming?
Oh, the winner. The crown... Girl.
Where did you get this confidence?
You have a lot of it.
Growing up, I was put
on the back burner for sure.
My sister had lots of stuff
she was going through.
I had to be my own support system,
my own biggest fan, so...
It sounds kind of lonely.
There's really no shoulder
for Violet to cry on.
-Besides my own.
-Right.
That's what you're showing
in this competition,
because you won
shadiest queen, remember?
-Did I?
-Did that hurt your feelings?
Kind of, but I knew that wasn't the case.
I was like, "I need to work harder
to show these girls who I really am."
I think the biggest thing
that I've learned
is to just be aware
of your first impressions,
because it could be difficult
to change someone's first impression.
I know that you're only 22, and you think,
"Well, a lot of people have this."
Let me tell you,
a lot of people don't have it.
You are really special.
A lot of people will take a lifetime
to get where you are.
-Thank you so much, Ru.
-Thank you.
-Pearl, darling, welcome to lunch.
-Thank you.
-Did you think you'd make it this far?
-Uh-uh.
You didn't? Have you surprised yourself?
I surprised myself coming in here
and retreating into "my shell."
I've never had these moments
of clamming up.
You were ready to tap out at one point.
I definitely was hurting, yeah.
But I'm all bark and no bite.
The thing is that I know your potential,
and I wanted to see it,
and I was feeling that it wasn't there.
-What was baby Pearl like?
-Baby Pearl?
-Yeah. Like, say, seven years old.
-Oh...
God!
When I was seven, you know,
I was scared shitless all the time.
I was going through
some pretty traumatic times.
It was just mental, emotional, physical,
psychological torment every day.
That's pretty rough. When I first met you,
I felt there was something else going on,
-and it felt like a traumatic issue to me.
-Yeah.
I'm not the kind of person
that opens up a lot.
So every time I do, it makes the weight
feel a bit more lifted off my shoulders.
Oh boy, has there been
a transformation in you.
At this point,
nothing can break my spirit.
Good. Well, condragulations.
-Mwah! Mwah!
-Mwah! Mwah!
<i>Flazéda</i>, girl!
-Hi, girls.
-Hi.
It's time to shoot
the music video for <i>Born Naked.</i>
For the first part, we're doing
choreography in front of a green screen.
[Candis] Before we start,
I have to let you know, this is it.
It's between your performance
and 100 grand.
Whew.
Hit it!
[Candis] Work. Give it to me, girl.
[Candis] Gorgeous.
-[tense music]
-What happened with the hair?
-It caught a breeze and flew away.
I hope it matches the other takes.
Lord be with me.
Pearl has a limited repertoire
as far as movement.
It's like she fitting to slam somebody.
That's why we call it the Pearl smash.
Pearl smash!
[Candis] Is there something going on here?
-Is that boy hair?
-Is it okay?
-I think your wig is sliding back.
-It's sliding back.
{\an8}These queens. Don't they know
a bobby pin when they see one?
You all are having wig problems.
You know that you're working with a fan.
-This is video.
-Sorry.
You want to be America's drag superstar,
and your wig is sliding back?
<i>But you want to be a drag superstar.</i>
Oh, oh, oh... uh, oh, okay, okay.
Do you need a moment
to go to the workroom and sort it out?
[Kennedy] <i>Unprofessional.</i>
Unacceptable.
While Pearl sorts her wig out,
let's get Violet up here.
-Is your wig on tight?
-I think so.
Okay. Cue music.
I'm trying so hard that I forget
I'm supposed to do choreography.
Whoopsies.
[tense music]
[Candis] <i>Violet's earring falls off.</i>
These girls. This is a music video.
<i>Didn't you glue your earrings on?</i>
Just try to give us a take
that we can use.
It was a shitty mess.
A hot one.
I'm talking about with flies on it.
Bitch...
We might have got something.
I hope it's enough.
We'll see.
What the hell are you looking at?
{\an8}It's our acting scene,
directed by Matthew Anderson.
<i>We'll play three different characters,</i>
<i>and they're gonna be cut together.</i>
I'm gonna kick y'all's ass.
Ru is gonna act alongside us,
and it's a bit intimidating.
And... action.
In science class,
we learned that all human beings
-evolved from lizards.
-You're a lizard.
Zip it, boy.
You kids are the reason
mommy needs her happy pills.
Ha-ha, look.
My dollies are kai-kai'ing.
You don't even know
what that means. I...
I hate it here. Woosh!
Okay, cut.
Pearl, you seem to just be hitting
one note all the way through.
You know, the anger you had
when you were gonna walk off the show?
-Remember that?
-Whoo-hoo!
-We all remember.
-Use that.
-Okay.
-Okay.
[Matthew] Here we go. Action!
Don't you give me no lip, boy.
Oh, I hate it here!
[Matthew] And cut. Very nice.
That was better with emotional intensity,
so, time to do the great switcheroo
and get into your next character.
All right, darlings, round two.
And... action.
Hurry up and eat.
Mommy's got to watch her stories.
Somebody pass me the potatoes.
Pearl is doing really well pilled-out.
[laughs]
-[Matthew] Action.
-What's that?
It's RuPaul's <i>Born Naked</i>,
available on iTunes.
Don't forget
to shamelessly plug that CD.
-Pick it up and show it.
-Okay.
Just show me
how you would do it right now.
Got it.
{\an8}Kennedy is an amazing performer,
but her biggest weakness
{\an8}is her short-term memory...
...loss.
Oh, pick it up?
It's RuPaul <i>Born</i>...
It's RuPaul's <i>Born Naked</i>,
available on iTunes.
Um, okay. Get the hell out of here
and change those damn outfits.
Action.
Don't you dare give me no lip, boy.
Don't call me boy.
Call me... Violet Chachki.
{\an8}Miss Violet
is flat lining as the teen queen.
Violet, you tend to sort of read
a bit of a monotone.
So let's just get
a few more spikes into your read.
-Okay.
-[Matthew] Very good.
[RuPaul] Isn't she clever?
-Action.
-Don't worry, little sister.
I'll come back for you when I'm famous.
Please make it stop.
[upbeat music]
-Whoo!
-Aaah!
-It's the last day.
-The last day.
It is the last time
that we are entering the workroom,
and at this point in the competition,
we're pretty much evenly divided
right down the middle.
On one end of the room, you have
Violet and Pearl, the "pretty girls,"
which they call themselves.
We don't call them that.
<i>And on the other end of the room,</i>
<i>you've got Kennedy and myself</i>
representing the bitter old lady brigade.
[Ginger Minj] I want to know
your first impressions that first day.
Pearl, when she came in,
and she was like, "Um,
I have a face chin on,
and blah, blah, blah."
-I was like, "This stupid bitch."
-"She's stoned."
"She's high as a kite out of her mind,"
so I guess my first impression
of Pearl was kind of spot-on.
Violet...
My first impression of you
is that, I mean,
you was full of yourself.
And has that changed?
No, it hasn't because...
because you haven't let it die down.
So I do respect you,
but still think you full of yourself.
I just feel like you are too young
to take on this type of responsibility.
I agree with Kennedy. It's a level
of maturity that you haven't reached yet.
[Kennedy] Thank you.
[Ginger Minj] This is a job title.
It's not just,
"Here's a check and a crown
and have fun."
You've got to be an ambassador
for <i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i>.
You are a representative, and I don't feel
like you've been in this game long enough
to know that you must step out of Violet
and be professional about some situations.
And I don't feel like you've been there.
You're not there yet.
Okay, I understand
more of what you're saying.
You don't want to be known
as being a bitch.
[Violet] That's it.
Violet is different.
In the beginning, she would be like,
"Fuck you.
I don't give a fuck what you think."
But here in this moment,
she's just listening and accepting it.
[Kennedy] You've got the bitter old
lady brigade to help guide.
I'm just saying.
["Cover Girl" playing]
{\an8}Welcome to the main stage
of <i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i>.
{\an8}Tonight it's just family, so God help us.
This week we challenged my girls
to star in the official video
for <i>Born Naked</i>.
And tonight they're stomping the runway
in their very best drag.
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.
{\an8}[RuPaul] First up, Kennedy Davenport.
{\an8}[Carson] Taste the rainbow.
[RuPaul] Yes.
[Kennedy] <i>I have on my pride dress,</i>
<i>fully rhinestoned,</i>
<i>with my matching rainbow shoes.</i>
<i>I am just head-to-toe pride.</i>
[RuPaul] The rainbow leads
to her pot of gold.
Her ass.
{\an8}Up next, Violet Chachki.
Man, she feels like a woman.
-[Ross] Come to the cabaret.
-[Michelle] <i>Willkommen. Bienvenue.</i>
[Violet] <i>I'm giving you</i> Victor Victoria<i>,</i>
<i>Marlene Dietrich, burlesque influences.</i>
<i>I'm feeling very razzle-dazzle</i>
<i>and like a fierce fucking bitch.</i>
[RuPaul] She's a chachki
with some fringe on top.
[laughs]
{\an8}[RuPaul] Ginger Minj.
{\an8}[Michelle] Ginger has fringe on her Minj!
-[Carson] I've got to go to the car wash.
-[RuPaul] Yes. Yes.
[Ginger Minj] <i>I am making sure</i>
<i>these judges see every rhinestone,</i>
<i>every piece of fringe, every single inch</i>
<i>of this big, bold, and beautiful bitch.</i>
[RuPaul] It's like they say:
the bigger the hair, the juicier the ass.
-[Carson] She is mopping up the floor.
-[RuPaul] Yes.
{\an8}[Rupaul] Pearl. Well, <i>flazéda</i>.
[Michelle] Ha-ha!
[Ross] From the Dee Snider
intimates collection.
[Michelle laughs]
[Pearl] <i>My look is a representation</i>
<i>of what my drag is about.</i>
<i>It's vintage,</i>
<i>it's over-the-top, and it's sexy.</i>
[Rupaul] What color is that,
Carson, mother-of-pearl?
[Carson] I think it is.
[Michelle laughs]
Welcome, ladies.
I couldn't be more happy
to see my kids succeed,
and you really did.
Kennedy, you were born naked,
but you've grown to become
a fierce drag queen.
Here's a photo of you
as a little bitty boy.
If you could time travel,
what would Kennedy Davenport
have to say to little Ruben?
I would definitely have to tell him
that it's okay
that you are different
from the other kids.
All the nights that you have cried
yourself to sleep,
it'll be over soon.
And that you're gonna be respected
for your gift.
Thank you, Kennedy.
Violet, here's a photo of you
when you were four years old.
What would Violet Chachki
have to say to little Jason?
Um...
I would tell him
to try to have more patience
with everybody,
especially with your parents,
and you just need to know
how special you are
and really bask in moments of weakness
and find strength in them
and push through everything and get
to a ballet class as fast as you can.
-Thank you, Violet.
-Thank you.
Ginger, here is a photo of you
when you were five years old.
What would Ginger Minj
have to say to little Joshua?
When it feels like
the entire world is against you,
you've always got a friend in yourself,
and when it gets to that moment
where you feel there's no alternative,
and you want to end it,
remember that in your life
there's gonna be stupidity coming at you
from a never-ending parade
of bigoted assholes.
And the only way to survive that parade
is to make yourself the grand marshal.
-Thank you, Ginger.
-Thank you.
Pearl, here is a photo of you
when you were four years old.
I've never seen
that child before in my life.
What would Pearl have to say
to little Matthew?
Oh, God.
I'd have to start with a warning.
You're about to enter the toughest...
You're gonna enter
the toughest years of your life, and...
it's gonna suck really bad
for a long time.
People are gonna fuck you up
and take advantage of you,
and people are gonna be looking at you
from across the room for so many years,
and you're not gonna understand why.
-Do you understand why now?
-Yeah.
You're a star, baby.
Yeah...
Thank you, Pearl.
Ladies, the winners
of this week's challenge
will move on to the top three.
And one of you will be going home.
It's time for the judges' final critiques.
First up, Kennedy Davenport.
Let's take a look at your dailies.
Hurry up and eat.
Mama's got to watch her stories.
Look, my two dollies are kai-kai'ing!
You don't even know what that means.
For the acting challenge, for me,
it was flat lined with no separation
between characters,
but you've made a lot of progress.
You look beautiful tonight.
This is representative of your best drag.
I really am very touched
about the transformation you've made.
Thank you.
Next up, Violet Chachki.
-What's that?
-It's RuPaul's <i>Born Naked</i>, now on iTunes.
What happened to manly music?
Oh, I hate it here!
This is why we can't have nice things.
I know dancing is not your favorite thing.
With that said,
I thought your dancing was really good.
For the acting challenge, I think
you had separation between characters.
You told the story beautifully.
Don't take this as shade,
-but did you run out of clothes?
-Oh, God, no.
Because for me,
this does not say "Violet's best drag."
It's a natural progression.
I think I get what you're doing.
-I think you do too.
-Okay, thanks.
Next up, Ginger Minj.
Guess who I saw
putting on mommy's makeup.
Shut up!
Boy, you'd better take off
that hoodie right now.
Don't call me boy. Call me...
Ginger Minj!
Your characters were the most fleshed-out.
Dancing is not your strong suit,
but I think you did it your way.
You had a wig malfunction,
and you made it work.
The fact that you went with it
shows your professionalism.
This bombshell white diamonds number
is the best drag that you've had
in the entire competition,
-and you saved the best for last.
-Thank you.
Next up, Pearl.
You get out of my house now!
Fine! I'm leaving.
Wait! Don't leave me here with them.
Little sister, I'll come back for you
when I'm famous.
Attagirl, Pearl.
Who would have thought,
a few weeks ago, that we'd be here today?
-I figured it out. You're a weirdo.
-Oh, fuck yeah.
In this particular challenge, you pushed
yourself out of your comfort zone.
You gave us three definable characters.
Then with the dancing, you don't move,
and it becomes that stoner stripper
so high she just wants the dollars.
We've all been there.
I think you look beautiful. I'm proud.
-You earned your spot here. Congrats.
-Thank you.
[RuPaul] Ladies, final question.
Why should you, and not your competitors,
be crowned America's next drag superstar?
We'll start with Kennedy.
I've been in this business
for 17 long years,
and I condone myself with professionalism.
As far as my competitors,
with the exception of Ginger,
I don't think the other girls are ready.
So I fear that they may not know
how to condone themselves.
That makes me think, "What do you have
to offer once you become the queen?"
And it's not much.
[RuPaul] Thank you, Kennedy.
All right, Violet Chachki.
I already feel like I am
America's next drag superstar.
I've been telling myself that
for a long time.
I've always looked up to myself. The only
validation I need is from this show.
As far as my competitors go, I feel
like I represent the past, the present,
but more than anything, the future.
-Thank you, Violet.
-Thank you.
-All right, Ginger.
-If I could,
I'd split this with Kennedy.
I'd say, "Crown us both.
We'll get conjoined twin gowns,
and we'll wear them all year."
But my other two sisters,
as much as I do love them,
Violet has the shortest temper
I've ever seen.
And that's a problem
when you're dealing with the world.
And Pearl, as much as she has grown,
was ready to walk away
from a golden opportunity.
Not to mention this is America,
land of the free, home of the fat people,
and if we supersize our French fries,
why can't we at least supersize
our next drag superstar?
Thank you, Ginger.
-All right, Pearl.
-I've busted my fucking ass my entire life
for everything that I have,
every article of clothing,
every rent payment.
You've been telling me how exhausted
I come off, and it's because I am...
from life. Yes,
I totally had a moment on this show
where I didn't think that I could go on.
But that doesn't define
what I've done on this show.
I do not like to keep myself limited
into some kind of drag box,
and I have so much more to show America.
Thank you, Pearl.
Now, while you untuck backstage,
the judges and I will deliberate.
All right,
just between us squirrel friends,
what do you think?
Let's start with Kennedy Davenport.
Her dancing was amazing.
She got rhythm.
And she is a great representation
of glamorous drag.
She's a hard worker,
and she is the professional of the group.
If she's the pro,
why wasn't that speech professional?
[RuPaul] <i>Violet Chachki.</i>
She's not a dancer, but she gave it
all she's got. She did a great lip sync.
And as far as her acting goes,
I was really proud of her.
She has told such a story
in her looks constantly.
I believe that she had
this last outfit planned all along.
That is not the best look.
Don't try to convince me.
-[RuPaul] <i>Ginger Minj.</i>
-Not a great dancer, but fine.
But she can give you comedy,
glamour, acting, and singing.
<i>She's a quadruple threat.</i>
She offers something different.
I grew up as a full-figured young boy.
And it does say something to kids
in small towns who may be chubby
that there's a chance
that they could rise to the top.
[RuPaul] <i>Pearl.</i>
At a certain point, we were all like,
"Check, please. I'm out."
But here she is in the top four
of this competition. That is so difficult.
{\an8}And she fought her way back.
And she made me fall in love with her.
She does have a boozy charm.
And it's star quality that she has
where you're intrigued, you know.
But is it too off-putting,
the sort of distance, for a fan
-to fall in love with her?
-I think they'll love her.
One more topic we need to discuss.
Michelle Visage. Carson, pros and cons.
Ah, you're funny.
Silence. I've made my decision.
Bring back my girls.
Ladies, before I can decide
who makes it to the top three,
this is your last chance to impress me
and save yourself from elimination.
The time has come...
...for you to lip-sync...
...for your life!
Good luck.
And don't fuck it up.
{\an8}[<i>Born Naked</i> playing]
[Kennedy] <i>I should be</i>
<i>America's next drag superstar,</i>
{\an8}because I'm bringing a level
that <i>Drag Race</i> has yet to see.
<i>It's the Kennedy Davenport</i>
<i>experience, baby.</i>
{\an8}Being crowned America's next drag
superstar means the culmination
<i>of a lifetime of work.</i>
<i>It's time that a big girl</i>
<i>wins this competition.</i>
{\an8}I represent the old
and the new styles of drag.
<i>I really am expressing myself</i>
<i>as a visual artist.</i>
<i>I am definitely</i>
<i>America's next drag superstar.</i>
{\an8}I should be America's next
drag superstar, because I do glamor,
<i>I do freaky, I do funny.</i>
<i>I've just worked so hard.</i>
<i>I just fucking deserve it.</i>
[cheers and applause]
[RuPaul] Wow!
Ladies, I've made my decision.
[tense music]
Kennedy Davenport. I'm sorry, my dear,
but you will not be moving on
to the top three.
Kennedy, the struggle is real.
And so is your God-given talent.
And your journey has just begun.
Thank you.
This has been a wonderful experience.
And I couldn't have asked
for anything more.
So thank you very much.
Now, sashay away.
I'm very disappointed
that I'm leaving right now.
<i>I've done all that I could do.</i>
And if it just wasn't enough,
it was enough for me.
Newark, LaGuardia, Kennedy.
[laughs]
I present to the world my final three.
All season long
I've consulted with the judges.
Now I want to hear from you, the fans.
Who do you think should be
America's next drag superstar?
{\an8}Are you team Ginger,
{\an8}team Pearl, or team Violet?
{\an8}Tweet your choice to:
@RuPaulsDragRace, #DragRace,
{\an8}and keep the conversation going
on <i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i> Facebook page.
Let your voice be heard. But remember,
the final decision is mine to make.
So tune in next week
to see the world debut
of the music video <i>Born Naked</i>.
And the week after that,
I will crown a winner
at the grand finale of <i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i>.
Now, remember, if you can't love yourself,
how in the hell
are you gonna love somebody else?
{\an8}-Can I get an "amen" up in here?
-Amen!
{\an8}All right. Now, let the music play.


Welcome to <i>RuPaul's Drag Race:</i>
<i>Countdown to the Crown,</i>
<i>Fashion Edition</i>.
{\an8}<i>Ginger Minj. Pearl. Violet Chachki.</i>
{\an8}Which of our top three cover girls
deserves to be America's drag superstar?
{\an8}To help you make up your mind,
we're doing some investigative reporting
{\an8}and dig deep into the charisma,
uniqueness, nerve, and talent.
{\an8}Still hungry for more?
{\an8}-Okay
-Good.
<i>Because we're going to break down</i>
<i>all you want to know about season seven.</i>
-But were too shy to ask.
-[high-pitched screaming]
Too shy. Too shy, my ass.
Some of you bitches
were real thirsty on social media.
-Saying stupid shit.
-Rude.
Tonight, we'll be joined
by our extra-special guest editors,
{\an8}<i>fashion mavens Raja and Raven,</i>
{\an8}and our reigning queen, Bianca Del Rio.
Plus, a who's who of queenly contributors
<i>who are going to get</i>

I just said "bottom."
I feel very uncomfortable right now.
Get ready for fierce fitness...

[RuPaul] <i>Hair-raising drama...</i>
<i>-Snatched queens...</i>
-Mm-hmm.
[RuPaul] <i>Sexy celebrity secrets...</i>

{\an8}And the world premiere
of <i>Born Naked: The Music Video</i>.
Honey, we are going vogue
as we prepare to read season seven
from cover to cover girl.
{\an8}[RuPaul] <i>The winner receives a year supply</i>
<i>of Anastasia Beverly Hills cosmetics</i>
{\an8}<i>and a cash prize of $100,000.</i>
Hello.
I'm RuPaul, editrix in queef
of the <i>Drag Race</i> empire.
With just one week until the grand finale,
{\an8}<i>let's flip through the glossy pages</i>
<i>of the most fashionable season ever.</i>
{\an8}Is this the most fashionable season ever?
It is.
{\an8}This season, my girls had the skinny
on how to be a mean, lean queen.
{\an8}Coming in at number four,
abs everywhere! Abs everywhere!
{\an8}I'm here!
{\an8}Jasmine Masters' abs.
You could do your laundry on those.
You'd think her costumes would be cleaner.
-How did you get this body?
-Girl, I don't know.
{\an8}Abs everywhere. Just abs.
Boop, boop, boop.
{\an8}I hope she markets
a Jasmine Masters Ab Master.
{\an8}Get it? 'Cause her last name is Masters.
{\an8}[RuPaul] <i>Number three:</i>
<i>Serving Sleek Chic!</i>
Miss Fame is sleek and slim.
{\an8}Miss Thing is giving me supermodel.
{\an8}She should be called Miss On Fleek.
<i>Her body's on fleek,</i>
<i>her brows are on fleek.</i>
Fuck Fame. Just be Fleek.
I'd like to thank Mexico
for the tapeworm that snatched my body.
These girls are making me feel fat.
{\an8}[RuPaul] <i>Number two:</i>
<i>No Pads, No Problem!</i>
Was padding out this season?
What's going on?
-Pearl.
-Uh-huh.
Now that you've come out of your shell,
maybe you could use that as a butt pad?
{\an8}Is she allergic to foam? I don't get it.
{\an8}If you are not wearing pads,
you are not doing drag.
I don't have to wear pads.
Pearl's body is fine.
She doesn't need pads. She's gorgeous.
Of course she needs to use pads.
You mean pad her personality? Oh, no.
I don't mind a skinny queen.
{\an8}[RuPaul] <i>Number one: Cinch It!</i>
{\an8}Oh, my God!
Oh, my gosh, Violet Chachki. That bitch.
She needed a breathing machine.
Iconic, legendary. That was epic.
I really could die, bitch.
I'm giving you realness.
I never want to meet you.
I hate you. Skinny bitch.
{\an8}Violet's a lovely girl.
It's a shame she's so morbidly obese.
-Hey, Violet, did you cinch?
-No, I have a hog body.
You call that a hog body, bitch?
Fail. #fail.
Thin may be in, but don't get it twisted.
Fat is where it's at.
{\an8}[RuPaul] <i>Large is still in charge.</i>
{\an8}At number three: It Do Take Curves!
Kennedy is a perfect example
of a curvy queen.
[RuPaul] She has got
quite a backstory going on there.
She wears this horse's ass as pads,
and I fucking love it.
She's talented.
Big hair, pageant, Texas drag.
[RuPaul] The rainbow leads
right to her pot of gold.
Her ass.
Come on, badonkadrrrrrk.
{\an8}[RuPaul] <i>Number two:</i>
<i>Binge on the Minj.</i>
{\an8}<i>I like to describe myself</i>
<i>as a glamor toad.</i>
I love a glamor toad. [croaks]
I'm envious
of a woman that's got the curves,
and just the cheeseburgers
and the ham hocks all around her.
You owned being thick-ums.
Come on, thick-ums!
I'm suffering from Ginger-vitis.
And I love it.
{\an8}[RuPaul] <i>Number one:</i>
<i>May the Fierce Be With You!</i>
{\an8}How y'all doing?
{\an8}Jaidynn walked in
jiggling from left to right.
I love a big bitch. Work, mama.
[clicks tongue]
[Ross] Oh, Beyoncé who?
[Jaidynn] <i>I'm giving the judges curves</i>
<i>and swerves and plump-a-liciousness.</i>
We've got to cook together.
I can throw down in the kitchen.
Fried chicken, corn bread, green beans.
<i>J'adore </i>Jaidynn Diore.
My girls always give good face.
But this season, they took it up a hair.
{\an8}Let's hear it for our hairy Marys. Ooh.
Ooh, girl, you know Willam was pissed
for missing out on that beard challenge.
{\an8}[RuPaul]<i> Number five: Abe-solutely!</i>
<i>Yowza, Baberaham Lincoln.</i>
Katya came out as Abraham Lincoln,
who has one
of the most famous beards in history.
His wife, Mary Todd Lincoln.
{\an8}[RuPaul] <i>Number four: Red Alert!</i>
I really liked Pearl
in her little papier-mâché beard.
[RuPaul] It's the devil made her do it.
[Jinkx] <i>She kind of looked</i>
<i>like the villain from the Powerpuff Girls.</i>
The one who's like,
"Yes, Powerpuff Girls."
{\an8}[RuPaul] <i>Number three:</i>
<i>Use Your Head!</i>
I haven't had any complaints.
Kandy Ho had this amazing
box of hair on her head.
-[RuPaul] Who doesn't love a hairy box?
-[Michelle] My husband.
Which actually happens to me a lot
when I put wigs in suitcases.
You pull them out,
and that's how they look.
{\an8}[RuPaul] <i>Number two: Hello Dalí!</i>
-[Mel B] I love the beard.
-My favorite beard look was Max.
He just looked like avant-garde.
Although I don't know what it is.
{\an8}Number one: Good Golly, Miss Molly!
{\an8}It's rock and roll legend Little Richard!
If you're wearing facial hair in the game,
you'd better be the biggest queen there.
Good golly, Miss Molly,
you might want to shave the upper lip.
-You can't do that.
-Why?
'Cause it's a man.
It was crazy that the other girls
were complaining about it
{\an8}because there was a Needles impersonator
who happens to be a man,
{\an8}and an Alyssa Edwards impersonator,
who happens to be a man.
{\an8}Shut up.
When it came to showing skin,
my girls were born naked,
and they stayed that way.
You're born naked and the rest is awful.
{\an8}[RuPaul] <i>Now touch all this skin, Henny.</i>
{\an8}<i>Number four: Show Your Assets.</i>
She just bent over
and gave you the whole story.
-Emphasis on the hole.
-[Michelle] What an ass.
I hope she had shaved.
{\an8}[RuPaul] <i>Number three:</i>
<i>She's a Real Cut Up!</i>
{\an8}Ginger ripped it all off
in that conjoined twin lip synch.
That bitch pulled out scissors
and cut herself away from Sasha Belle.
Where was she holding them?
Were they under her wig?
Sometimes you have to allow
your audience to see you bare it all.
Even if that means that your titties
are hanging out and your wig is off.
That was a titty-twister.
{\an8}[RuPaul] <i>Number two:</i>
<i>When in Doubt, Whip it Out.</i>
{\an8}There is some stuff in that workroom
you do not want to see.
I mean, some of y'all do.
[Pearl] Trixie's back,
that uncut dick hanging out.
[Pearl] Let's see your wiener.
We haven't seen one in a while.
-It's not in a good place right now.
-Show us your dick!
-It's shriveled up now.
-I want to look.
Can I fluff for a second?
Hold on, I need to think good thoughts.
{\an8}[RuPaul] <i>Number one: You Do You!</i>
{\an8}For Violet's nude illusion,
she just came out nude with a little tape.
[judges gasp]
[Violet] <i>I'm comfortable being naked</i>
<i>with a piece of duct tape on and a smile.</i>
If I was doing nude illusion, I'd come out
naked and say, "This is what you wanted."
And then I'd lift up my penis,
and there'd be a disco ball underneath.
Panties, bitch!
My fashionistas, with just one week until
the grand finale of <i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i>,
which one of these top three cover girls
should be America's next drag superstar?
{\an8}<i>Are you Team Ginger Minj?</i>
{\an8}<i>Team Pearl? Or Team Violet Chachki?</i>
Let your voice be heard.
I think I was confused by the assignment.
-More nudity!
-Okay, girl.
This has been
our most snatched season ever.
Basic witches not wanted.
{\an8}What keeps my girls looking good
and feeling gorgeous?
{\an8}Well, they got their secrets.
{\an8}[RuPaul] <i>Fitness is fierce.</i>
{\an8}Health tips from drag queens?
Are you crazy?
{\an8}[RuPaul] <i>Fit tip number five:</i>
<i>Don't Forget to Stretch.</i>
{\an8}Katya, that bitch can spread
her legs like peanut butter.
[Katya] <i>I pounded my vagina into the stage</i>
<i>so hard that the building shakes.</i>
{\an8}Katya's very limber.
[Bianca] <i>Katya has amazing muscle control.</i>
She must be
the most popular hooker on her corner.
I'm kidding. Nobody fucks her.
{\an8}[RuPaul] <i>Number four: Don't Act Your Age.</i>
Sissy that walker?
That is <i>All Star 2055.</i>
Senior citizens' edition.
[RuPaul] Girl, your pacemaker is on fire!
[laughter]
Ru is shady, making them dress up
like old ladies so he looks young.
Don't you wish your granny
was hot like me?
{\an8}Another challenge
where Max never dropped character.
{\an8}I think he remained an old lady
for the rest of the season.
I love the smell
of Bengay in the morning.
{\an8}We know what they're going to look like
in about 20 years, some in five.
Shade goggles.
{\an8}[RuPaul] <i>Number three:</i>
<i>Get Plenty of Rest! But not too much.</i>
{\an8}Pearl, you've been sleepwalking.
A drag queen who's sleepy
all the time. Original.
[RuPaul] It's like a runway on Ambien.
{\an8}I think Pearl just sleep-lives.
{\an8}You just have those personalities
that are just natural stoners,
even if they've never picked up a blunt.
Wake up, Pearl.
Wake up.
{\an8}Wake the fuck up, Pearl.
Pearl, honey, it's time for school.
Wake up.
Ah! Okay, I'm awake.
{\an8}[RuPaul] <i>Number two:</i>
<i>Dance Your Padded Ass Off!</i>
Dancing is important exercise.
Well, actually, I don't dance.
I just have sex.
That shit looked hard. I can't do that.
I thought I was watching
<i>So You Think You Can Dance?.</i>
From the house of Beyond Belief
Dance Company, two thumbs up.
Ding!
{\an8}[RuPaul] <i>Number one: Fly Girl, Fly!</i>
{\an8}Flinging yourself off a stage
and landing in a split is always in vogue.
Kennedy served all the fitness.
Calisthenics and Pilates was happening.
And the facial muscles were all working.
Roar, Kennedy! [growls]
[meows] That's my roar.
Whew, that was a workout.
But if getting physical isn't your thing,
you can always get some good work.
I've never thought of that before.
{\an8}'Cause Plastic is Fantastic.
Tape: it's not just for tucking anymore.
[Bianca] <i>Those tape face-lifts</i>
<i>looked so natural.</i>
Just like Miss Fame's face
in the first episode.
Who knew looking this good
could be this cheap?
{\an8}This is the nose
I have always dreamed of.
{\an8}It's like Phantom of the Opera
meets Joan Rivers. Oh!
How do I sleep at night?
Ask your husband.
[laughs]
[chewing]
People always ask me,
"What's your diet secret?" It's simple.
A mint for breakfast,
a mint for lunch, and for dinner...
-a glass of water, no mint.
-Really?
{\an8}[RuPaul] <i>I'm proud to present</i>
<i>the Drag Race Diet.</i>
Eat it!
Now here's some real useful advice:
never skip meals.
There's always room for Jell-O.
{\an8}[groaning]
What in Fantasia Barrino
is going on up in here?
{\an8}-Cut!
-Oh, my fucking god.
[Pearl] <i>I was sitting</i>
<i>in 40-degree Jell-O. I'm freezing.</i>
Miss Fame has a total erection
rubbing on me.
Just get me out of here.
I actually heard red wine
is quite good for you... by the box.
{\an8}-[Michelle] Leopard line, box of wine.
-[RuPaul] Yes.
{\an8}I don't drink wine,
{\an8}but if I were on the stage and it's
all that's there, let's get classy drunk.
He better have that boxed wine chilling.
Pinkies up, girls.
My number-one diet tip? Protein.
I like long walks on the beach,
big dicks, and eggs.
She's the egg queen.
Coo, coo, ca, choo.
This season, everyone is wearing eggs.
Your country breakfast is ready.
When it comes to coining an expression,
my girls are real trendsetters.
That's right.
{\an8}So pay attention
and get ready to sissy that talk.
My pussy is trending on Craigslist.
What are these kids
coming up with nowadays?
{\an8}[RuPaul] <i>Number eight: Better Call FEMA!</i>
{\an8}When I see Jamal there,
I about flood my basement.
Bring out the sandbags.
-[all cheering]
-[Violet] Oh, my goodness!
Santino Rice.
I flood my basement, bitch.
That's going to be a mess to clean up.
Mildew and mold.
You need, like, the Rug Doctor.
{\an8}[RuPaul] <i>Number seven: The Chachki Cheer.</i>
{\an8}[Violet] Aaah! Come through!
[RuPaul] Come through, mama.
[Violet] That waist, bitch. Come through!
Come through, long hair.
Come through, psoriasis.
{\an8}[RuPaul] <i>Number six: Cooking with Pam.</i>
{\an8}[Jaidynn] <i>No, ma'am, Pam. No turkey.</i>
-No, ma'am, Pam.
-Yes, ma'am, Pam.
Yes, ma'am, Pam.
No, ma'am, no ham, no Pam,
no cauliflower, no cornbread, no beans.
Who's Pam?
{\an8}[RuPaul] <i>Number five:</i>
<i>Build that Brand, Girl.</i>
{\an8}Miss Fame is a fucking brand.
I'm like, ew, I don't, bitch. My brand.
I'll call myself a brand every day.
I'm a goddamn brand.
You a brand, a brand.
A brand what, muffin?
Miss Fame's brand...
Well, she's a hand model.
Isn't she? She always doing this.
-Miss Fame.
-Oh, the brand.
Miss Fame claims to be a brand.
Yeah, so is Kirkland, bitch.
{\an8}[RuPaul] <i>Number four: The Kennedy Curse.</i>
{\an8}Child, the struggle is real.
Clearly, the struggle is real.
You know what's real? The struggle.
The real struggle she's having
is getting her ass in pantyhose.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, okay.
{\an8}[RuPaul] <i>Number three:</i>
<i>When Life Gives You Lemons.</i>
No tea, no shade, no pink lemonade.
Ooh, I love me some pink lemonade.
Bitch got me thirsty.
[Jasmine] <i>No tea, no shade,</i>
<i>no pink lemonade.</i>
Why's she taking all the beverages away?
-Don't be mad.
-Ding!
{\an8}[RuPaul] <i>Number two: Pearls of... Wisdom?</i>
{\an8}We're probably the two most,
kind of, <i>flazéda</i> sort of, like...
-The most what?
-<i>Flazéda</i>, it's a new hashtag.
She sleeps. When she wakes up,
she's talking shit nobody understands.
-[RuPaul] Well, <i>flazéda</i>.
-How you spell that?
F-L-A-D... No.
F-L-A...
{\an8}Give me a pen.
F-L-A-Z, E with a hyphen over it, D-A.
{\an8}Make sure that you hyphenate that "E."
It's very important.
{\an8}-[RuPaul] <i>Number one...</i>
-Shit RuPaul says.
Hey, that's me.
She done already done had herses.
She done already done has herses.
Is that correct?
She done already done had herses.
What does "herses" mean?
Um, okay. I was coming from the club.
And I went to Krystal Burger
in Atlanta, Georgia.
And we would go and get our food on after,
you know, partying and everything.
Somebody had come up to pick up a bag,
but it actually didn't belong to them.
And this girl behind the counter said,
"Uh-uh, no, no, no.
She done already done had herses."
And of course, I've, you know...
taken that to the bank.
With one week until the grand finale
of <i>RuPaul's Drag Race,</i>
which one of the top three cover girls
deserves the crown?
{\an8}Sound off now,
because if you snooze, you lose.
-Right, Pearl?
-[blows raspberry]
<i>Our cover girls weren't the only ones</i>
<i>who exposed themselves this season.</i>
Our judges and extra-special guest judges
kept it real,
served it raw, and got it twisted.
<i>Get ready for</i> Star Secrets Exposed.
-Am I giving too much today?
-No.
-Look around.
-Okay, good.
-Yeah, true. What am I saying?
-Look around.
You're young to have hot flashes.
[Mel] I'm not that young.
I'm 39. I was like, shit.
So Victoria was
the first one who turned 40?
[Mel] Geri. But then again,
nobody really knows how old Geri is.
She holds that passport so tight.
How dare you, Michelle?
She comes out here in crutches
with some Amadeus realness, right...
Darling, it's always the same silhouette.
You can throw crutches on it,
still the same silhouette.
-That silhouette with the powdered wig--
-Snatch waist. The same thing.
No dessert for either of you tonight.
Poop is natural. Everybody poops.
[Demi] I don't.
Ever.
This season, the fashion was on fleek.
But in a season of killer looks,
which bitch wore it best?
Let's hear from Raja and Raven
on how to look like a winner, baby.
{\an8}We're talking about our favorite looks
of season seven of <i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i>.
And one that we didn't quite... get.
One of my top picks was Miss Kennedy
in her leather and lace gown.
[Raja] <i>Oh, yes.</i>
<i>Very Kennedy. Very LaGuardia.</i>
Probably more Newark, but still cute.
Here's my first favorite.
Katya in the <i>Death Becomes Her</i> challenge.
I always love a bit of a sight gag.
It's like the banana peel in comedy.
<i>If I were in that challenge,</i>
<i>I would've done something more glamorous.</i>
Asphyxiation via a fabulous silk scarf
from a floating chandelier above me.
And then I would sing
"Chandelier" by Sia.
Cue music. Oh, no, we can't afford it.
My next look was Violet Chachki
in her Hello Kitty extravaganza.
<i>Other-worldly, very reminiscent</i>
<i>of Hello Kitty herself.</i>
Isn't Uranus the planet
with the ring around it?
-No.
-That's Jupiter.
-[Raven] <i>Now, let's talk about RuPaul.</i>
-[Raja] <i>The goddess herself.</i>
My favorite was the black velvet dress
painting of herself with the white afro.
[Raven] <i>Honey, this look featured</i>
<i>naked RuPaul riding a black panther.</i>
-It was different.
-Yeah.
She never brings
anything up around the neck.
Maybe she just had a hairy chest that day.
Whatever. She looks great.
I love this look. Yes, God.
Now, my least favorite look
from the entire season
had to be Kennedy's look
for the <i>Death Becomes Her</i> challenge.
-What was that?
-A huge WTF.
[Raja] <i>#chickenorwhat, remember that?</i>
Her explanation of the outfit
did not make sense.
Something about being a hooker
and a phoenix rising and...
-Crystallize.
-Oh, my God.
She just looks like a crystal meth addict
in Phoenix, Arizona.
-Can we go to break?
-No.
The biggest prize of all is still to come.
{\an8}<i>Which of our top three cover girls</i>
<i>deserves the crown?</i>
Let me and the world know all about it.
Scientists have discovered
that honesty isn't just the best policy,
it adds years to your life, which means
these bitches are going to live forever.
{\an8}<i> Realness rules</i>
<i>in our top three moments of truth.</i>
{\an8}Is honesty the best policy?
Of course.
{\an8}At number three: Mad About Michelle.
{\an8}I hate Michelle Visage.
{\an8}Yeah, you're gonna win now.
{\an8}Some of these queens,
I feel like they bitchy-osed this season.
{\an8}What contestant that young goes on
a reality show competition like RuPaul's,
which is a lot of work,
and says, "I hate the main judge"?
Like, that is punk.
Girl!
She probably has a bigger man-body
than I do without her implants.
[Jasmine] Come on, don't go there, girl.
{\an8}I like her.
{\an8}How are you going to win the challenge
and then get back in the workroom...
and done try to sneak one in
on Michelle Visage?
Honey, we all hate Michelle Visage.
We just don't say it with cameras around.
{\an8}[RuPaul] <i>Number two: Queens Go Clean.</i>
-How long have you been sober for?
-I've been sober for nine years.
But counting days in here
feels like being a newcomer.
That's what it feels like.
{\an8}It's nice to see drag queens
talking about their sobriety
{\an8}because partying and drinking excessively
have been a part of the gay community,
but it doesn't have to be.
You're being so hard on yourself.
You're in it, but you're not alone.
I'm here with you
having those same fears and feelings.
I mean, good for Katya and Miss Fame.
I love sobriety.
<i>I mean, good on them.</i>
Clean streets are the best streets.
{\an8}[RuPaul] <i>Number one: Motherly Love.</i>
{\an8}Pearl had that sort of really scary,
uncomfortable moment
{\an8}with RuPaul.
Well, you kind of told me
I had no personality.
I mean, that doesn't make me feel good
or give me confidence.
I said, "Oh, girl.
Don't do it, Jackie. Don't do it."
Stop, stop, stop it, stop, stop.
No, no, no, no, no, no, stop.
[Bianca] <i>Don't look at Ru in the eyes.</i>
<i>You're turning into stone.</i>
You're turning into stone.
She is taking your soul.
Do I have something on my face?
Bitch! Ow! No.
No, I'm just not convinced.
And I want you to do well.
That's why I brought your ass here.
I was uncomfortable.
Clutching my pearls.
I didn't even mean that like that.
You know, FYI, for all you girls up there,
I don't want to hear any goddamn excuses.
Ru got into it this season too.
She let them have it after that challenge.
Be prepared.
-We didn't have time to re-rehearse...
-Make it work. Make it work.
If Ru yelled at me like that,
I would have just cried.
I'd be like, "I'm Jasmine Mastering it up.
I'm packing all my shit, and I'm out.
I'm not wanted here anymore."
Fucking make it happen. I don't want
to hear any goddamn excuses anymore.
The last thing you want to do
is piss off Ru. Mm-mm.
I still can't look her in the eye.
She's terrifying.
[laughs]
It's hard for viewers to truly appreciate
what our girls go through each season.
I'm sorry, I need to relax.
[RuPaul] <i>So I've called</i>
<i>a professional to break it down.</i>
Coming from a place of love,
light, and understanding,
please welcome... Bianca Del Rio.
Aw, who needs a hug?
Kidding. Don't come near me.
<i>Let's start with Tempest DuJour.</i>
[grunts]
I saw a drag queen in a Mexican restaurant
do that exact same entrance.
Except it wasn't a baby.
-That's disgusting.
-[Ru laughs]
Which leads us to Mrs. Kasha Davis.
I'm home!
Miss Kasha Davis is from Upstate New York,
where they produce winners
like Pandora Boxx and Darienne Lake.
-What?
-There's no talent in the water.
-Trixie Mattel.
-So...
It was really so sad to see Trixie go.
Twice. Ha-ha!
<i>Max.</i>
I don't want to rely on grossness or
sexuality. That's what people always do.
Max is always complaining
that drag queens are too vulgar.
You know what's vulgar?
That fucking accent, bitch.
And that brings us to Miss Fame.
I'm hitting a wall, and I'm finding myself
having a conversation with myself.
Her personality is so amazing
that, growing up,
her only friends were chickens.
Some people would say I love cock.
Ca-caw! And then there's
our distinguished top three.
Ginger Minj claims to be the glamor toad,
but when you look at her,
she's been eating more than flies.
Pearl. The best thing about Pearl's drag?
She's cute as a boy.
[Bianca] <i>Violet Chachki.</i>
[Michelle] <i>Her waist is so small!</i>
I was really shocked when I saw
Violet come out with that oxygen tank.
-'Cause that meant Ru wasn't using it.
-Bitch!
-And who can forget Michelle Visage?
-Mmm...
She's constantly saying that,
"RuPaul is my best friend."
Funny thing is you don't hear Ru say it.
The opinions expressed
by Bianca Del Rio do not represent
{\an8}those of RuPaul's Race,
Logo TV, World of Wonder,
{\an8}the NAACP, or the Friends
of the Pacoima Public Library.
Except the part about Michelle Visage.
I kind of agree with that one.
Now, our top three queens,
Pearl, Ginger Minj, and Violet Chachki,
have each made it this far
thanks to a certain thing
we call <i>je ne sais quoi</i>,
which in French means
"their pussies are on fire."
{\an8}-Hi, fellas.
-[RuPaul] <i>Ginger, a plus-size powerhouse,</i>
<i>a killer comedian,</i>
<i>and a natural-born performer.</i>
{\an8}-I love you, Justin Bieber.
-[laughs]
Ginger can serve up some strong tea...
We don't mean any harm, girl.
Except when we do.
And still leave you gagging for more.
{\an8}Ginger Minj for the crown.
This girl has it all.
{\an8}She can sing, act, dance...
Nope, not so much dance.
Boom, boom, boom.
{\an8}She is confident, funny,
and she just looks like she smells good.
Pearl, your razor burn is so bad
the only way I can read you is by braille.
She can read a bitch for filth
with a beating heart underneath it all.
I can't believe I'm crying on fucking TV.
What Ginger has that no one else has
<i> is that extra...</i>
fifty pounds.
{\an8}[laughs]
{\an8}I cannot wait to see
a big girl win <i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i>.
{\an8}I always thought Jinkx Monsoon
was the first plus-sized winner.
This season,
Ginger accomplished the impossible.
<i>She got gay men everywhere screaming...</i>
I love the minj.
[RuPaul] <i>But does Ginger</i>
<i>have the right amount of sugar, spice,</i>
<i>and show-stopping skills</i>
<i>to snatch the crown?</i>
In one week, all will be revealed.
{\an8}<i>Next up, a precious gem</i>
{\an8}<i>who took her own sweet time</i>
<i>to come out of her shell.</i>
{\an8}-'Sup?
-<i>But once she did...</i>
-she sparkled.
-Thank you.
-Pearl.
-Pearl is beautiful.
This porcelain mug.
You can't mess with that.
Pearl has
a very New York approach to drag.
She always puts
that high-fashion twist on it.
Bitch, you can wear fur in spring, okay?
I mean, Pearl's hot. As a boy, goddamn it,
she can get me pregnant.
Totally. I'll raise it.
I think the turning point for Pearl
was she started listening to the judges.
And she, like, took her Adderall.
It's neat to see
vulnerability come out of Pearl.
I didn't know that tears
came out of them sleepy eyes.
What would Pearl
have to say to little Matthew?
You're going to enter
the toughest years of your life.
It makes you want to hug her.
And everybody grows.
I mean, she's growing. She grew!
You're a star, baby.
I love her.
Sleeper queen Pearl had the tenacity
<i>to rise and shine her way to the top.</i>
<i>Her attitude and edgy looks</i>
<i>have fascinated the nation,</i>
leading many to believe
the jewel in the crown will be a Pearl.
Yeah!
{\an8}Uh-oh. Ooh, la, la, la, la, la.
-Last...
-Yay!
But by no means least...
<i>She's young, beautiful, and outspoken.</i>
That's right.
With a sophisticated knowledge of fashion
well beyond her years.
<i>When it comes to style,</i>
<i>she just might have this competition</i>
<i>all cinched up.</i>
This is Violet Chachki.
I love her style. She has a great eye.
She does a beautiful makeup.
Violet should win based purely
on the fact that she had a black thing
and took off the belt,
and it turned into a plaid thing.
Oh, that look was everything.
{\an8}-Miss Thing.
-[tongue pops]
{\an8}That ho's been reading some magazines.
The internet happened.
Have you heard of it?
Oh!
Violet is a bitch.
I don't trust a drag queen that isn't one.
[Violet] <i>People think I'm mean,</i>
but everything I've done comes
from a place of humor or a place of truth.
She's not bad.
She's just painted that way.
I want you to know that I'm going
to be working on the way I come across.
She's like Courtney,
you got to get to know her
to know that there's no malice.
-You have something that I don't have.
-Beauty?
She's still a bitch,
but she's a bitch with a heart of gold.
Like Bianca Del Rio.
Violet evolved
from a fiery-tempered fashionista...
-What?
-<i>To a glamazon with grace.</i>
<i>But in a race</i>
<i>that's tighter than her corset,</i>
can Violet snatch the crown officially?
Come through!
There you have it. Your top three queens.
But which one of these cover girls
will be America's next drag superstar?
{\an8}It's anybody's guess.
Are you Team Ginger Minj?
{\an8}<i>Team Pearl? Or Team Violet Chachki?</i>
{\an8}<i>Hashtag it now and tell the world.</i>
It's your chance to break the Internet.
Who do you want to snatch the title
of America's next drag superstar?
<i>Are you Team Ginger,</i>
<i>Team Pearl,</i>
<i>or Team Violet Chachki?</i>
And one week from tonight,
I'm reserving you a front-row seat
<i>to the grand finale of</i> RuPaul's Drag Race<i>.</i>
All right, girlfriends. Loosen your tuck.
Let it all hang out
for the world premiere
of <i>Born Naked: The Music Video.</i>
And remember,
if you can't love yourself naked,
how the hell you going to love
somebody else naked?
Can I get an amen up in here?
[all] Amen.
Now, let the music video play.
{\an8}["Born Naked" playing]
{\an8}[RuPaul] <i>I wore a lobster dress.</i>


{\an8}[RuPaul] <i>Previously on</i>
RuPaul's Drag Race<i>...</i>
{\an8}You'll portray Merle,
myself, and Michelle Visage,
<i>as you reenact our </i>Ru Hollywood Stories.
Mother does not play!
-That.
-Fuck!
You two are...
I forgot my line!
[Katya] <i>I think we're gonna need</i>
<i>a bigger boat.</i>
-[RuPaul gasps]
-Oh, my God!
[Michelle] Is she a chicken or a horse?
-Max, what was it that I asked you for?
-Not to wear any gray hair.
I'm waiting, and I'm becoming impatient.
Katya, you're the winner
of this week's challenge.
Jaidynn Diore Fierce. Shantay, you stay.
Miss Ho, sashay away.
{\an8}-I survived!
-[Katya] Ugh, bitch!
{\an8}[Jaidynn] "Everything happens
for a reason.
{\an8}Kandy Ho."
{\an8}I survived the lip sync,
and no, ma'am, Pam, no ham,
{\an8}no turkey, no cauliflower.
I can't do that again.
{\an8}I'm fixing to do one wig that's not gray,
and then I'm going right back to gray.
{\an8}Sorry, Michelle. She was like,
"What did I tell you last week?"
If they gave me specifics,
I would fucking do it.
{\an8}Miss Max still choose
to pull out them dust-ass gray-ass wig.
<i>I'd like to see her at the bottom,</i>
so she can get a reality check.
I.J.S. I'm just saying.
Let's talk about you in this corset.
How does she breathe?
I don't get it.
I feel amazing!
Are we gonna sit around and talk,
or are we gonna get out of drag?
[Violet] Collect all them stones, girl.
{\an8}I'm over Kennedy missing
the mark on these looks.
Didn't look like she was dead
nor like a woman.
{\an8}Kennedy's look is like, "What?"
She was like...
"The fuck, what am I supposed
to do for this one?"
I honestly think Kennedy just needs to go.
She looks like Tony the Tiger on crack.
[tiger growling]
{\an8}[RuPaul] <i>The winner gets a one-year supply</i>
<i>of Anastasia Beverly Hills cosmetics</i>
{\an8}<i>and a cash prize of $100,000.</i>
{\an8}<i>With our extra-special guest judges,</i>
<i>Michael Urie and Tamar Braxton.</i>
-Oh, God!
-Another day, another dollar.
Another day, another drag.
[Katya] <i>It's a new day,</i>
<i>and it's down to eight girls.</i>
{\an8}My game plan going forward is to kill
a few of them to make it to the top.
-[alarm blares]
-[RuPaul] <i>Ooh, girl!</i>
<i>She done already done had herses!</i>
-<i>Hey, racers!</i>
-[all] Hi!
<i>Like my mama used to say,</i>
<i>"If you ain't got nothing nice to say</i>
<i>about someone, don't say nothing at all."</i>
<i>Or just ask Bianca Del Rio</i>
<i>to say it for you.</i>
<i>Oh, look at you guys. I hope</i>
<i>you're not as stupid as you are ugly.</i>
<i>Listen, I've got one tip for you.</i>
<i>You're a drag queen. Be funny!</i>
-I have nothing to say.
-For once.
[Ginger laughs]
-Hello, hello, hello.
-[all] Hi.
[Violet] A vision in polka dot.
For weeks, you have been encouraged
to show us the real you.
And you know what?
I've had about all of that I can take.
So today, it's time to find out
who else you can be.
-That's right!
-[Max] Oh, no.
This week's maxi-challenge...
Snatch Game!
{\an8}Now go on and hashtag that.
{\an8}Snatch Game is the challenge
that every fan has been waiting for.
We put on giant, latex frog costumes,
and we go through a fiery obstacle course.
Okay, all right. I'm sorry.
You compete on a live game show,
a parody of the <i>Match Game</i>.
You need to impersonate another star's
charisma, uniqueness, nerve, and talent.
But be careful whose you choose.
'Cause it could be a very hairy situation.
I know that feeling.
Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best woman win.
Okay, Snatch Game. Down to business.
-Who are you doing?
-Donatella Versace.
I'm doing Donatella Versace!
I've been working on this
for eight months.
I should be out there.
This would be a great chance to push
myself out of the pretty little box.
{\an8}I'd been planning to do Donatella
since the first time I auditioned.
I mean, come on, girl.
One of you has to be
the bigger person and just bow out.
-[Miss Fame] Do you have a backup?
-Not at all.
I literally don't have
any other choice. I'm doing it.
-[Katya] Who are you gonna do?
-I was thinking about...
doing Little Richard.
-But he's a man.
-You can't do that.
-Why?
-'Cause it's a man.
But I'll be in drag.
He been in drag his whole life.
-No, ma'am.
-No Richard.
It's a man!
Snatch... Vagina!
[Ginger] Why don't you do Sweet Brown?
She only has one line.
-She's got a monologue.
-She's got, "cold pop,"
"bronchitis," and,
"ain't nobody got time for that."
It's funny,
and people are gonna know who it is.
I'm really torn. I just don't know
who I'm gonna do at this point.
[Violet] Who are you gonna do?
[Max] Sharon Needles.
Max is doing Sharon from season four.
She has a darker side to her.
I'll do Disney Sharon Needles.
Really? Sharon's shocking and punk-rock,
and that's kind of
out of character for Max.
Hello, hello, hello.
[all] Hello.
-[RuPaul] Jaidynn Diore Fierce.
-[Jaidynn] Yes.
-Who are you gonna be?
-Raven-Symoné.
How are you gonna channel Raven-Symoné?
She's just kinda high-pitched,
and she's always like, "Oh!"
Girl, no comment.
If we met, we could be best friends.
But what does that have to do
with Snatch Game?
We sitting in the audience have to say,
"Ah, that is so Raven!"
You get back to work.
Hey, good looking. What you got cooking?
I had an unexpected turn of events today.
-What happened?
-Two of us had the same character.
-What queen is it?
-It's Violet.
We were both gonna do
Donatella Versace, but...
I've chosen to do Theresa Caputo,
the Long Island Medium.
Yeah, yeah.
Was it a discussion, or she said,
"I am doing Donatella"?
-She didn't have a backup, and--
-Listen, Miss Fame,
the competition is narrowing down.
So you've got to go for the jugular.
You were kind enough
to change your first choice,
But being kind is one thing.
Being the winner is completely different.
Do what's in your best interest,
not in the best interest of others.
Well, shit, I'll be Versace.
This is a competition. Sometimes,
you have to step over other girls
to get where you wanna go.
So... Sorry, girl.
{\an8}Today's maxi challenge is Snatch Game,
which is a <i>Drag Race</i> version
of the original show, <i>Match Game.</i>
-Hello, Katya.
-Hi.
-Who are you?
-Suze Orman.
-Have you done her before?
-No.
I know that you do a Russian accent,
'cause the Katya character is Russian.
Why didn't you do a Russian character?
'Cause you do it so well.
What is it you're afraid of?
I don't know. I think my whole life,
I've been riddled with anxiety,
-fearful of things that aren't a big deal.
-Ah.
{\an8}I'm afraid to show
this character because it's...
{\an8}the thing that I do best,
and I am terrified of failing at it.
You have an addiction to the anxiety.
I've never thought of that before.
I've been addicted to alcohol,
crystal meth, cocaine.
You're here because you're super talented.
-Don't be afraid.
-Okay.
[Katya] <i>Addicted to anxiety.</i>
LaGuardia, Newark, Kennedy.
-Who are you doing?
-I've been trying to figure it out,
so I came up with Sweet Brown...
-"Ain't nobody got time for that."
-Or Little Richard.
Uh-huh. Is that what you're gonna go with?
I just... I don't really know.
I'm torn, really.
Well, I'm gonna leave that to you.
I can't decide for you,
and that's all I'm gonna say.
{\an8}I think it's very risky
going with Little Richard.
The stakes are very high going into
the Snatch Game, so I'm just debating.
-Violet Chachki.
-Hi, RuPaul.
I heard a little rumor
that you're doing an Italian superstar.
-I am Versace.
-She's been funny in skits on television.
How will you avoid doing
what someone else has done?
I think I can execute a better look than--
Look is one thing.
There is a different skill to be funny.
-Let me hear your Italian accent.
-A woman should feel confident, sexy.
She should put something on her body
and feel like she owns the world.
All right.
What other ideas did you have?
I was thinking of even doing
Alyssa Edwards maybe.
Can I see your Alyssa Edwards?
Real once, done. Top, bottom, done.
That's good. You might want
to consider switching to Alyssa.
Motherfucker. Stir the pot, RuPaul.
Do you want a spoon?
All you gotta do is make me laugh. Okay?
-Get to work.
-Thank you.
All right.
Can I get a time check?
I cannot believe this shit.
[Pearl] If you're more comfortable
doing Donatella, then do it.
I'm more comfortable doing
Donatella when there was just one.
I guess I'm gonna fucking do
Alyssa Edwards then.
[Pearl] You don't have to do it
just because RuPaul said you should.
Am I gonna do better than her?
Or is it gonna be competition?
It will definitely be a competition.
Ladies, later today, I will meet you
on the set of Snatch Game.
So good luck and don't fuck it blank.
[RuPaul] <i>Welcome to Snatch Game.</i>
Let's meet our contestants.
A talented actor
who's spent more time in Barbra
Streisand's basement than she has.
Michael Urie!
-Hi, Michael.
-How are you?
Good to see you.
And all's fair in love and war
with the real Miss Tamar Braxton.
Are you ready to meet our stars?
{\an8}Let's go.
{\an8}Our first star is drag superstar
from the House of Haunt,
{\an8}Sharon Needles.
{\an8}Have you been to any good séances lately?
{\an8}I just got back from one.
{\an8}[dramatic music]
{\an8}[chuckles]
{\an8}All right, down to our next star.
This Cosby kid is all grown-up.
{\an8}Welcome Raven-Symoné.
{\an8}-I just had a vision.
-Really?
{\an8}-I'm a lesbian now.
-[RuPaul] Oh, my goodness!
{\an8}-That's so Raven.
-That is so me.
{\an8}Next up, financial adviser Suze Orman.
{\an8}Hello, my darling dear
little chickadee RuPaul.
{\an8}Now, Suze,
I make $8 an hour hosting this show.
{\an8}-Can I afford a yacht?
-How about a little rubber ducky?
{\an8}I'll throw in
a hot bag of nickels just in case.
{\an8}You've got a deal!
{\an8}Now, from the hit web series
<i>Alyssa's Secret,</i>
{\an8}-Alyssa Edwards!
-[pops tongue]
{\an8}I'm Alyssa Edwards, and this...
is Snatch Game.
I've always wanted to ask you,
what is your secret?
{\an8}-I'm sitting on it.
-[RuPaul] Oh, okay.
{\an8}[cackles]
{\an8}-[Violet] Almost got me there, bitch.
-Oh, good to know.
{\an8}From the Genovese crime family,
it's Big Ang!
{\an8}Hi, RuPaul. I'm feeling very excited.
{\an8}-What is your bra size?
-It's a medical mystery.
From the House of Versace,
it's Donatella Versace.
{\an8}Donatella Versace how's them boots?
How are you?
I'm doing great. Is it pronounced
"Ver-sayz" or "Ver-sa-chi"?
{\an8}It depends on where you come from.
I would have had an Italian accent
instead of a Russian accent.
{\an8}I don't mind.
But... hey.
{\an8}Good golly, Miss Molly!
It's rock and roll legend Little Richard.
{\an8}Are you feeling a little more tutti
or a little more frutti?
{\an8}A little more tutti, baby!
{\an8}[holds a note]
{\an8}Shut up.
{\an8}Last but not least,
music superstar Adele is here.
{\an8}-Hey, girl!
-Could I buy vowels?
{\an8}-What is that, darling?
-No whammies!
{\an8}No, this is the wrong show.
{\an8}Okay.
{\an8}Are you ready to play the Snatch Game?
{\an8}[Kennedy] <i>It's time for Snatch Game!</i>
Whooo!
Shut up.
[RuPaul] <i>Welcome back to</i> <i>Snatch Game.</i>
{\an8}Here's how the game works.
I ask a question, you give an answer
{\an8}that you think will match
our celebrity contestants'.
First question is
for the beautiful Tamar Braxton.
{\an8}Quentin Tarantino is remaking
<i>The Wizard of Oz</i> as an action movie.
{\an8}In this new version,
Dorothy "blanks" the Tin Man.
{\an8}-All right, Tamar.
-She kills him, okay? Good-bye.
{\an8}Now let's go to our stars and hear
what they have to say. Big Ang?
{\an8}You know what, in my family,
we like to do it the old-fashioned way.
{\an8}You gut 'em like a fish.
-That's a match!
-Yes. Ding, ding, ding!
{\an8}-Big Ang!
-Yeah! Yeah!
{\an8}Financial adviser Suze Orman.
In this new version,
Dorothy "blanks" the Tin Man.
{\an8}Of course she bangs him,
{\an8}which is what I'd like to do
to most of these women here on stage.
{\an8}Except for this one down here,
Miss Donatella.
{\an8}She looks like a skeleton
made out of beef jerky.
{\an8}[laughter]
{\an8}I love you, Justin Bieber.
{\an8}Let's move on down
to rock and roll royalty.
{\an8}Little Richard!
Dorothy "blanks" the Tin Man.
{\an8}She tightens the screws.
{\an8}'Cause we all love a tight screw. A-whoo!
{\an8}-[RuPaul] Sorry, that is not a match.
-Shut up.
{\an8}[Kennedy] Whoo!
{\an8}Raven-Symoné. That's so Raven!
{\an8}-I just saw it.
-What is it?
{\an8}-She blows him.
-Unfortunately, that is not a match.
{\an8}I'll try again.
{\an8}-No, I saw the same thing.
-Same thing?
{\an8}Let's move on down here to Adele.
{\an8}-Where in England are you from?
-My house.
{\an8}-All right. Dorothy "blanks" the Tin Man.
-Well, if it was me,
{\an8}I would say she rips out his heart
and then sings a whole album about it
{\an8}and gets really popular, but...
{\an8}-it's not me.
-No, no.
{\an8}So I said she polishes his chrome.
It's a good answer, but not a match.
{\an8}Well, could I get a match, please?
It's a fake cigarette.
All right, Donatella Versace.
{\an8}This is not
a doctor prescription refill card?
{\an8}I must be confused.
{\an8}But I did say,
"Hose down Versace boots," eh?
{\an8}[RuPaul] Interesting answer.
{\an8}Honey, that wig was a bad investment.
That's read.
All right, this one's for Michael.
{\an8}Rumor has it that they're making
a gay version of <i>Batman &amp; Robin.</i>
In this movie, the dynamic duo convert
the Batcave into a "blank".
-A bed &amp; breakfast.
-I would stay there.
-I would too.
-Let's go to Sharon Needles.
{\an8}I said haunted house!
{\an8}[RuPaul] I'm sorry, but not a match.
{\an8}Moving on down to Raven-Symoné.
{\an8}The dynamic duo convert
the Batcave into a...
{\an8}Weave shop!
{\an8}Oh, Jaidynn, I just got a vision.
You might be lip-syncing
for your life tomorrow, baby.
{\an8}I'm sorry, raven.
Moving on down to Suze Orman.
{\an8}I was looking over here at Big Ang,
and I thought of a foreclosed mobile home.
{\an8}You know what, that's fucked up.
{\an8}[RuPaul] All right, Alyssa Edwards.
{\an8}The dynamic duo convert
the Batcave into a...
{\an8}A dance studio, baby.
Hashtag, beyond belief.
{\an8}Not a match, but a nice plug
for your dance studio.
{\an8}-All right, Big Ang.
-Well, I don't know
{\an8}about Batman and Robin,
but I love money, yacht, and mansions.
-Mansion.
-It's underneath a mansion.
{\an8}-[RuPaul] It is.
-I had a rough childhood.
{\an8}I wasn't watching
fucking <i>Batman and Robin.</i>
What say you, Little Richard.
{\an8}You know, me and Batman and Robin
have a lot in common, baby.
{\an8}I said a bathhouse
in a dark room with glory holes.
{\an8}There'll be a lot of singing
going on up in there, honey. Whooo!
I'm sorry, Little Richard.
That is not a match.
{\an8}Shut up.
{\an8}Next question is for Tamar Braxton.
{\an8}Portia says Ellen is so hilarious
even her "blank" makes her laugh.
I'm gonna have to say coins,
honey, makes them laugh.
-Even her coins.
-They so rich they pee pennies.
Pssh, pennies.
Let's go over here to Sharon Needles.
{\an8}I said temper tantrums.
{\an8}-You know why?
-Why?
{\an8}Because Ellen never has temper tantrums.
{\an8}[RuPaul] Wait a minute.
{\an8}Her temper tantrums make her laugh
because Ellen does not have them.
{\an8}She does, but everything she says
is so damn funny. You can't even tell.
{\an8}Not a match for Tamar. All right, Adele.
{\an8}Adele, how much food
do you have down there, girl?
{\an8}-Smorgasbord.
-I have low sugar.
-[RuPaul] Low sugar.
-[Ginger] I do.
{\an8}She's using my EBT card.
{\an8}-[RuPaul] Oh, Lord!
-[Kennedy] Whooo!
{\an8}-Oooh!
-Wrong note, sugar.
Portia says Ellen is so hilarious
even her "blank" makes her laugh.
{\an8}Sad, sad tears of a clown.
-Like the Smokey Robinson song.
-Yeah.
{\an8}I'm so sorry, Adele. That is not a match.
{\an8}-But it's a song.
-[RuPaul] It is a song, but--
{\an8}-Did I sing it?
-[RuPaul] No, you didn't.
{\an8}So it's not a good song.
{\an8}Probably still won an award for it anyway.
[RuPaul] Probably, yes.
Oh, my stars! Time is up.
Which means our winner is...
{\an8}my therapist.
{\an8}We'll be tweeting more questions
@RuPaulsDragRace.
{\an8}So you can keep on playing at home.
-Say good night, stars!
-Good night, stars!
[RuPaul] See you next time
on the Snatch Game! Bye-ee!
{\an8}Child!
{\an8}Sir, what do you want me to do today?
{\an8}It's time for another elimination,
and people are really feeling the pressure
because there's only a handful of us left.
{\an8}[Katya]<i> </i>I'm second-guessing myself
about my performance.
<i>I don't know where I stand</i>
<i>in the eyes of the judges.</i>
All I can hear is the voices in my head
telling me how terrible I am.
-Can I talk to you?
-I'd love to.
Okay.
What's going on?
I am kind of freaking out.
I've been completely sober
for the past year and a half.
Most of the time, I'm fine. But being away
from my support network has been brutal.<i> </i>
I know that Fame is sober, so she's
the only other person who can understand
exactly what I'm going through.
-How long have you been sober for?
-For nine years,
but counting days in here
feels like being a newcomer.
That's exactly what it feels like!
Like, it's hard.
-I've never seen that of you.
-I'm pretty good at hiding it.
-I am terrified of failure.
-Yeah.
And my sense of humor is just, like...
-It's been a smoke screen for that.
-Yeah.
And I have to tell you,
the first day I came in here,
the first thing I thought of was,
"You don't belong here.
You're not good enough."
I didn't realize how badly...
I've actually never been able
to love myself, and it's like...
You are, love. You are loved.
I'm having to deal
with the insecurities I don't wanna face,
and I did not expect that.
You're being so hard on yourself.
You're in it, but you're not alone.
I'm here with you,
having the same fears and feelings.
My character defects are on fire,
and people are seeing me,
and they're like, "Girl talks a lot."
That's my obsessive mind running!
{\an8}There's a lot that I'm relating
with Katya on an emotional level.
To connect and let go of those fears
makes me feel stronger.
This moment is what I needed.
-I needed it too.
-Thank you so much.
-Let's go put some war paint--
-I'm Miss Fame, and I'm an alcoholic.
My name is Katarina Zamolodchikova,
and I'm a drug addict and alcoholic. Ugh!
After my talk with Fame,
I feel like a weight has been lifted.
-Oh, God!
-I can't go back!
Let's go paint.
[RuPaul laughs]
Welcome to the main stage
of <i>RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
{\an8}Well, if it isn't my favorite
female impersonator, Michelle Visage.
{\an8}And Ross Mathews.
Do you do any impersonations?
-I do a mean Morgan Freeman.
-Can I hear it?
[high-pitched]
Hi, Miss Daisy!
Hi!
-You wanna take a ride?
-That's so good.
{\an8}And the fabulous Michael Urie.
Did you enjoy playing with <i>my</i> dolls?
Only my therapist knows for sure.
{\an8}And Tamar Braxton. Are you ready
for some <i>Drag Race</i> family values?
Yes, God!
This week, we challenged
our queens to fill in the blank
with their best celebrity impersonations.
And tonight, they're serving up
a two-for-one special of leather and lace.
Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best woman win.
{\an8}-[RuPaul] Ginger Minj.
-[Michelle] Yes.
[Michelle] Nice day for a white wedding.
[Ginger] <i>Girl, I'm spinning,</i>
<i>I'm turning, I'm posing.</i>
<i>I am giving them Elvis "Prissley" now.</i>
-[Tamar] Runway Roseanne.
-[Michelle] Drag is a religious activity.
[RuPaul] Ginger has a real cross to bear.
{\an8}-[RuPaul] Katya.
-[Michael] Oh!
{\an8}[RuPaul with British accent]
Samantha Fox is such a wild dame.
[Katya] <i>I'm trying to just serve</i>
<i>sexy and confident whore.</i>
<i>Slutty cougar on the prowl.</i>
<i>Third-rate Faith Hill impersonator.</i>
<i>Eighty percent sexy,</i>
<i>20 percent disgusting.</i>
[Michelle] Look out, Tawny Kitaen.
We got a new Whitesnake, bitch.
[RuPaul laughs]
{\an8}[RuPaul] Newark, LaGuardia,
Kennedy Davenport.
Call her Miss Ross.
[Kennedy] <i>I'm presenting body,</i>
<i>face, leather and lace.</i>
[RuPaul] Kennedy Airport,
permission to land.
[Michelle] This is my black box.
{\an8}-[RuPaul] Violet Chachki, girl.
-[Tamar] Hallelu.
[Ross] "S" and "mmm-mmm good."
[Violet] <i>I'm giving you 1940s</i>
<i>John Willie vintage smut for your nerves. </i>
<i>Soft, hard, all mixed</i>
<i>into one amazing runway walk.</i>
[RuPaul] The dominatrix sleeps tonight.
{\an8}Max. Oh, the merry widow.
{\an8}[Michelle] The "why it gotta be black"
widow.
-[Michelle] Oh, look at that stinger.
-[RuPaul] Yeah.
[Max] <i>Today, I'm giving</i>
<i>the not-so-remorseful widow</i>
<i>whose husband just happened</i>
<i>to have died mysteriously,</i>
<i>and I want to be very surreal.</i>
<i>Of course, as usual.</i>
-[Michael] She doesn't seem so sad.
-[Tamar] Uh-uh.
{\an8}[RuPaul] Jaidynn Diore Fierce,
aka Chaka Khan.
[Jaidynn] <i>I have my lace nude illusion,</i>
<i>along with hair</i>
<i>for months and weeks and years.</i>
[Ross] That's not a carry-on wig.
You gotta check that.
{\an8}[RuPaul] Here comes Pearl.
{\an8}[Ross] We're both wearing pink.
I think that's two in the pink.
-[RuPaul] That's right. Oh, my God.
-[Ross] Yeah.
[RuPaul] It's perfect.
[Pearl] <i>I'm feeling super confident</i>
<i>as I walk down the runway,</i>
<i>wearing sort of, like, </i>Grease,
<i>but it's still totally me.</i>
-[RuPaul] We're gonna rule the school.
-[Michelle] Rizzo is PG.
[RuPaul] Pass it on.
{\an8}Miss Fame. Dark lady, snap out of it.
[Miss Fame] <i>This is a new look for me.</i>
<i>It's a fresh, sexy take on Miss Fame.</i>
<i>I'm loving this face,</i>
<i>I'm loving this lace,</i>
<i>and I'm loving my hair.</i>
-[RuPaul] Cagney and Lacey.
-[Ross] "Gag me" and Lacey.
Welcome, ladies. It feels like
a convention of ex-Prince protégées.
When I call your name,
please step forward.
Violet Chachki.
Pearl.
You are both...
...safe.
You may leave the stage.
Now it's time for the judges' critiques.
Starting with Ginger Minj.
I thought you were truly brilliant
as Adele.
You never left character,
and it was a complete transformation.
Today, you owned being thickums.
It was like, "This is me, eat it."
The only thing that I would change
is your hair is a little too triangular.
I was trying to do
like an Elvis "Prissley"
-kind of thing.
-I would've gone all the way.
-I usually do.
-I heard that about you.
I'm the one that wrote it
on the bathroom wall.
-[RuPaul] Next up, Miss Fame.
-You look stunning.
It's not '40s, it's something different.
And that's really refreshing.
Snatch Game. You had so many
missed opportunities, and I wanted more.
It felt like you were 20% there.
You'll never have this opportunity again.
Be here in the present,
and don't let this moment pass you by.
All right. Newark, LaGuardia, Kennedy.
I am not a fan of anybody
doing boy drag. You know this.
You killed it.
I was like, "Who let
meetratchetpeople.com in here? What?"
But you gave me all the light
that I needed yesterday.
I didn't expect this risk from you.
You're my pageant queen.
I'm not always head to toe.
I like to get messy too.
-Oh, okay.
-And this gown, I would climb you.
-Oh!
-[RuPaul laughs]
-Can we go to break?
-Shut up.
-[RuPaul] Next up, Max.
-Thank you for the new hair color.
You know what I miss?
Is the gray hair. You look fantastic,
but I think you look normal.
[Michelle] Snatch Game.
You had the look down 100%.
What was missing was everything else.
Sharon's got a twisted sense of humor,
and that was missing,
-and I hate to say--
-It looks like Max is coming apart.
Yeah, I just really needed
to loosen the corset.
-Okay.
-I apologize.
Can we get some help for Max?
{\an8}[Ginger] <i>Oh, bitch, here we go.</i>
{\an8}Cue the dramatics.
You can tell she's an actress.
-Max, are you okay?
I took advantage of the moment.
[Miss Fame] <i>Is this a strategy?</i>
{\an8}Because this is one of the first times
that she's not been a shining star.
-Yes.
-[exhales]
-Next up, Jaidynn Diore Fierce.
-[Tamar] Today...
I'm still trying to put it all together,
the look. Somehow, it just...
falls flat.
As far as being Raven-Symoné,
it became real like,
"Okay, she's gonna see a vision."
Once, it was funny.
The second time, it was cute.
The rest of the time, it died.
[RuPaul] Next up, Katya.
To go from Suze Orman
to Xena the Warrior Princess,
you look so beautiful and...
I'm losing my train of thought.
You really strutted your stuff,
and you were like Britney at 45.
And yesterday was just "hilarical", okay?
I really laughed the whole...
I just wanted even more.
I know I'm always asking for more,
but y'all can take it further, so push it.
Thank you, ladies. We've heard enough.
While you untuck backstage,
the judges and I will braid
each other's hair.
Oh, fun!
You may leave the stage.
Just between us squirrel friends,
let's talk about Ginger Minj.
She chose a character
that was creative and also challenging.
She came out in all white,
and everybody was in all black.
<i>Only superstars know</i>
<i>to do things like that.</i>
-There's no cons.
-No cons.
I bet there's been a con in her
-once or twice, you know.
-[RuPaul] <i>Miss Fame.</i>
She looked the part of Donatella,
but she didn't deliver comedy.
She's not breaking through.
She doesn't feel solid in herself.
-[RuPaul] <i>Kennedy Davenport.</i>
-[Michael] The way that she walked,
<i>look at the spot she would stand in,</i>
<i>even point at the spot,</i>
and then circle it and leave it
and not even stop.
And then Snatch Game,
it was such an over-the-top caricature.
It just worked.
The giant Bea Arthur shoulder pads.
-The lip gloss.
-[Tamar] <i>She changed Little Richard.</i>
She killed it for me.
-[RuPaul] <i>Next up is Max.</i>
-When she came in looking so great,
and then there was no characterization,
that was a real bummer for me.
Max likes to stay in a comfort zone.
I think that Max has more potential.
She just needs to find it.
-[RuPaul] <i>Jaidynn Diore Fierce.</i>
-The Snatch Game was one note.
-I was over it... dot com.
-Okay.
If I'm on <i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i>,
don't come as Chaka's little sister.
You come as Chaka.
-That's all she has to say about that.
-Okay.
-[RuPaul] <i>Katya.</i>
-Her Suze Orman was spot-on.
I understand that it didn't go full-tilt,
but I loved it.
Like, she gave me futuristic
Britney Spears tee-hee-hee, honey,
and Whitesnake tee-hee,
and, you know, Guns N' Roses.
Silence.
I've made my decision.
Bring back my girlses.
Welcome back, ladies.
I've made some decisions.
Katya.
You're safe.
Kennedy Davenport. Great gosh almighty.
You rocked the Snatch Game.
Condragulations, you are the winner
of this week's challenge.
[applause]
Thank you.
{\an8}I won another challenge. Yay!
Ginger Minj, your Adele
had us rolling in the aisles.
Condragulations, you are also
the winner of this week's challenge.
That's right, ladies. First tie
in Snatch Game herstory.
{\an8}I won! If there was ever
a challenge to win, it is this one.
[RuPaul] <i>You've both won fabulous</i>
<i>feather accoutrements from Mother Plucker.</i>
You may join the other girls.
Ebony and ivory.
Jaidynn Diore Fierce, your vision
of Miss Symoné was not so Raven.
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
Miss Fame, "don't-a-tella" me
that was your best impersonation.
Max, your Sharon Needles missed the point.
Max...
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
{\an8}[Max] <i>Damn, damn, damn!</i>
{\an8}I can't get over the feelings in my head
of disappointment in myself.
{\an8}It's really sort of overwhelming.
Miss Fame, you may join the other girls.
Two queens stand before me.
This is your last chance
to impress me
and save yourself from elimination.
The time has come
for you to lip-sync
for your life!
{\an8}I can't go home. I refuse.
I gotta protect my spot here.
Good luck
and don't fuck it up.
[RuPaul laughs]
[cheers and applause]
Ladies, I've made my decision.
-Jaidynn Diore Fierce, shantay, you stay.
-Thank you so much.
You may join the other girls.
Max, you are a true original.
Thank you for taking us all to the max.
Now, sashay away.
[Max] <i>I was able to represent myself.</i>
<i>I stayed as classy as I possibly could.</i>
I feel like I've been in a dream.
For me to go back to Kansas from Oz,
it's all so surreal.
But there's no place like home.
My seven sisters,
I have a confession to make.
I fear I've made a terrible mistake.
That I've let one of the eliminated queens
go home... too soon.
{\an8}Ru, girl, what?
{\an8}I'm just not sure which one.
Could it be Tempest DuJour,
{\an8}<i>Sasha Belle,</i>
<i>Jasmine Masters, Trixie Mattel,</i>
{\an8}<i>Mrs. Kasha Davis, Kandy Ho, or Max?</i>
{\an8}Ah, shit.
{\an8}No, no, no!
{\an8}Well, I'm sure it'll come to me.


{\an8}<i>Previously on </i>RuPaul's Drag Race<i>...</i>
{\an8}You'll be performing the pre-flight video
for Glamazonian Airways.
{\an8}-[RuPaul] Sasha Belle.
-I lost you in the safety video.
{\an8}The dress was just kind of schlumpy.
{\an8}Katya, your outfit is a Xanadu,
but your lip-sync was a Xana-don't.
Ginger Minj, condragulations. You're
the winner of this week's challenge.
-Katya, shantay, you stay.
-Thank you so much.
Sasha Belle, sashay away.
{\an8}[sigh of relief]
{\an8}-Fuck that noise.
-Holy moly.
{\an8}We get back to the workroom
and Sasha left us a little message.
{\an8}Love you, mean it! Ging for the win.
{\an8}Ging, you got a fangirl.
{\an8}Opinions are like assholes.
{\an8}<i>Everybody has one.</i>
{\an8}But it doesn't count. She's gone. Next.
-Goodbye, Sasha. We love you.
-We love you, Sasha.
{\an8}This week, I survived by the skin
of my fucking fingernails.
It was the most stressful thing
I've ever done.
I'm gonna fucking murder
that next challenge, whatever it is.
Get me out of this shit.
I'm so happy to be out of these heels.
[grunts]
We got good feedback and recognition
for our group, girl.
It was very well-deserved.
I already knew when they picked the group
that it would be weaker.
When they picked that group,
I knew it was buffoonery,
because they all look alike. They're all
the same height and weigh two pounds.
{\an8}Fame, Trixie, Pearl. Then there's that old
tight-ass, long horse-face Violet.
Them four just rub my nerves out.
All they want to do is talk and walk
their asses in heels, that's not drag.
Y'all sashay away. [laughs]
Get your asses up out of here.
I don't like shit about them hoes.
Not the air they breathe, not their
bony-ass, slim, up-and-down pole bodies.
I would love to send all them
home in one walk.
<i>Especially Violet.</i>
<i>Where are your panties, girl?</i>
We don't want to see
that Barbie doll, mannequin pussy.
Cover that ass up.
Panties, bitch.
{\an8}<i>The winner of </i>RuPaul's Drag Race
<i>receives a one-year supply</i>
{\an8}<i>of Anastasia Beverly Hills cosmetics</i>
{\an8}<i>and a cash prize of $100,000!</i>
{\an8}<i>With our extra-special guest judges,</i>
<i>Kat Dennings and Mel B.</i>
[pop music playing]
-Good morn-ting.
-Good morning, Hollywood.
{\an8}It's a new day and I'm happy
that I am still here, honey.
{\an8}Still here and still kicking. Yes, ma'am.
-Jaidynn, how are your feet?
-Girl, I took a shower last night
and my toes started stinging
from open wounds.
You got to pop them corns
so the kids can eat. [laughter]
To feed the children.
[alarm blaring]
[all oohing]
{\an8}[RuPaul] <i>She done all ready</i>
<i>done have hers.</i>
<i>To she or not to she?</i>
<i>That 'tis the question.</i>
<i>Whether it is nobler</i>
<i>to be America's Next Drag Superstar</i>
<i>or just some thirsty-ass ho.</i> [laughter]
<i>Now, all the world's a stage,</i>
<i>but watch your back, "hinney,"</i>
<i>because everybody's a critic.</i>
[car whizzing]
-Uh-huh-oh.
-What is that about?
[bell dings]
[beeping]
[all laughing, oohing]
Hello, hello, hello. Hi, everybody.
She got your hoveround. Yes!
America's Next Drag Superstar
needs to have longevity,
even after her charisma,
uniqueness, nerve, and talent
gets old, dry, and dusty. [coughs]
Ladies, it's time to release
your inner golden girl.
-Oh, pit crew!
-Yay!
[laughter]
-Hey, panties.
-Now, today's mini challenge
is an old, old-fashioned
soul train dance line.
We're calling it Sissy That Walker.
-Are you living?
-Yeah!
-Well, more like assisted living.
-Yes!
You've got 15 minutes
to get into some old lady drags.
And in the end,
the two grooviest grannies will win.
Ready?
Set?
[beeping]
Go!
-[electronic music playing]
-Are you taking the blue?
All right, ladies.
Let's bust a move. Just don't break a hip.
{\an8}Ginger Minj. Grandma said,
"Knock you out!"
[laughter]
{\an8}Mrs. Kasha Davis.
{\an8}Yeah! This looks like the cast of Cocoon.
[laughter]
{\an8}Pearl.
{\an8}Oh, my God. Is that Elaine Stritch?
{\an8}Jaidynn Diore Fierce.
{\an8}I thought she had retired from twerking.
[laughter]
{\an8}Trixie Mattel.
[laughter]
Girl, your pussy
is on once-a-month Boniva.
[laughter]
{\an8}Max.
{\an8}She's a friend of Dorothy... Zbornak.
[laughter]
{\an8}LaGuardia Newark Kennedy.
{\an8}Ooh, yeah! Drop it like it's icy hot!
[laughter]
{\an8}Miss Fame.
{\an8}She's fallen and she can't get up!
But she sure can get down.
[laughter]
{\an8}Violet Chachki.
{\an8}No teeth, all shade.
[laughter]
{\an8}Jasmine Masters.
{\an8}[record scratches]
Where did you get a loaf of bread?
[laughter]
{\an8}Katya.
{\an8}I love the smell of Bengay in the morning.
[laughter]
{\an8}Kandy Ho.
{\an8}Ooh, granny's dusty!
[laughter]
Hey, granny! Get it, granny!
[laughter]
Wow, you guys did great!
But two of you did extra-special,
as in, you know, early bird special.
{\an8}The two winners
of today's mini challenge are...
{\an8}Max and Kennedy Davenport.
Plinko!
We'll be posting these gifs at logotv.com
so grandma and them can see them too.
Now ladies...
The word "drag"
was first used by Shakespeare
as an acronym for "dressed as a girl."
Back when, you know,
all the female roles were played by men.
For this week's Maxi Challenge,
you'll be acting in a comedic adaptation
{\an8}of two Shakespeare classics.
<i>Romy &amp; Juliet.</i>
{\an8}And my favorite, <i>MacBitch</i>.
{\an8}[laughter]
{\an8}Hashtag Shakesqueer.
{\an8}Now, Max and Kennedy,
you get to pick your castmates
and assign the roles. Max, you pick first.
Ginger Minj.
Come here, you little comedian.
Jasmine.
Trixie Mattel. [clicks tongue]
Katya.
Mrs. Kasha Davis. Get over here, girl.
Pearl.
Jaidynn. Get over here as fast as you can.
Kandy.
That leaves Miss Fame and Violet.
Max, who do you want on your team?
-Fame.
-My mothballs are on fire.
Which means Violet Chachki
is on Team Kennedy Davenport.
{\an8}I have no idea
why I'm getting picked last again.
Now, in a moment, Michelle Visage and I
will meet you on set
to direct your shoot.
Tomorrow on the runway,
the category is Bearded and Beautiful.
Gentlemen, start thine engines,
and may the best woman winneth.
{\an8}Let's see what this <i>MacBitch</i> is about.
{\an8}So we get MacBitch,
a crazy cheerleader parody of <i>Macbeth</i>.
{\an8}I've never even seen...
What is the original name? Mc...
{\an8}-[producer] <i>Macbeth</i>.
-<i>Macbeth</i>?
I don't even know what <i>Macbeth</i> is,
honestly. Call me young. Call me,
like, illiterate. Whatever.
I've never seen <i>Macbeth</i>.
Okay. I think I'm ready to assign.
Lady MacBitch, the pretty one,
the ambitious, ruthless wannabe mean girl.
That sounds like Violet.
[laughter]
Laquisha Kanina MacBitch. [laughs]
-The tough ghetto woman.
-I don't want to be the ghetto girl.
Because that's, like, so common. I could
really turn myself into Lady MacBitch.
-Lady MacBitch?
-Yes.
I kind of don't want
to put people in their, like...
-Comfort zone?
-Yeah.
So, Violet, I would like
for you to be ghetto.
We have an hour to get this down,
so we need to figure it out.
Yeah, it's figured out.
You Laquisha Kanina MacBitch. Okay?
Her and Jasmine are friends, that's why
Jasmine has the role of MacBitch,
even though it is perfect for me.
You are the team leader.
Whatever you want, Boo-boo.
<i>There's no pleasing Violet</i>
<i>if it doesn't go her way.</i>
She always has a stank face.
She's just a bitch.
{\an8}So this is some Shakespeare shit.
{\an8}This week's main challenge is to act
{\an8}in a new adaptation
of a Shakespearian classic.
I'm so excited.
I've done Shakespeare plenty...
and he liked it every time.
[Max] <i>We got </i>Romy and Juliet
<i>and I'm excited.</i>
{\an8}I do have, like,
some legitimate Shakespearian experience.
-So let's go through the characters.
-Do you have a 30-day trial?
Attention, please. Everyone, when I have
my hands up like this, attention.
All right, kittens. Lady Cappuccino,
Juliet's drag mother, a little older.
-I think I know who that one sounds like.
-[laughs]
Juliet's BFF, a vapid, ditsy party girl.
Let's see how many lines she has,
then we'll talk.
Mercutia, she's more ratchet,
kind of a hoochie.
-See, I think you should be Mercutia.
-Come on, house...
-Capulet. Is that correct?
-House Capulet, yeah.
-Capu... Capulet.
-Capulet. Exactly.
I don't know what that means.
-You're, like, totes montage-eau.
-Montague.
Monta-goo.
{\an8}Some of these girls look like
their Shakespeare is gonna be shaky, dear.
Montag-ew!
Ew!
{\an8}This is so not your gig.
{\an8}When you go:
"This is so not your gig," you be like...
-So not your gig.
-This is so... not your gig.
Sound like more Regina George.
{\an8}Jasmine has the role of MacBitch
and it's, like, a really sassy, bitchy...
This is so not your gig.
She's not really serving that.
Basic bitches not wanted.
I get the ghetto girl
and I'm serving it well.
Head cheerleader is gonna be me,
Laquisha Keanni. That's right.
The struggle is real. Um...
I want to make a judgment call here
because I just don't feel comfortable.
I need Jasmine and Violet
to switch characters.
Jasmine, just be the ghetto girl
and make it work.
Bitch, I already gone done
filled my ghetto fantasy.
Let's switch scripts.
So because of Jasmine's fucking up
we should change quick?
We should definitely
run through it right now.
No, no. Just read on your own.
<i>So now, well into our challenge,</i>
<i>Jasmine and Violet</i>
{\an8}have to learn new parts.
Now it's just a race against time.
{\an8}[Renaissance music playing]
{\an8}Team Max. Welcome.
{\an8}It is time to showcase
our "Shakesqueerian" play,
<i>and my team better know their lines.</i>
But in case they don't,
I know them for them.
-All right, you lipstick thesbians.
-Get it, guys. You got it.
-And action.
-[beep]
First day of school.
House of Caparus is gonna rule.
-Capulet.
-Fuck! Sorry.
-All right. Action!
-[beep]
Soft, but what light do break?
I'm Juliet,
but you can call me Cupcake. Hey!
Ho! You two have to chill.
You're from enemy crews!
-"Romy? You'll get yourself banished."
-Oh.
Romy, you'll get yourself banished...
if you hang with that flooz.
I'm sorry, I need to relax.
Mercutia, what's going on?
I'm not really experienced in acting.
I'm giving it the best...
Girl, you are a drag queen.
You are experienced at acting.
Okay.
What's going on, Jaidynn?
What's happening?
I just... [sobs] I get in the moment
and I just kind of freak out.
I want this so bad and...
I'm sorry. [sniffles]
I just... [sobs]
{\an8}Jaidynn begins to tear up and it all
sort of comes down on her at once.
-I got this.
-Yes, girl.
-You got this.
-Shake it off!
-Shake it off!
-Yeah.
So we're gonna do it one more time.
Romy, girl! You was my sister!
Why?
Ladies, uh, we're done.
-That's a wrap.
-Thank you.
{\an8}It's unfortunate because, had Jaidynn been
a little bit more confident and prepared,
<i>we could've really nailed it.</i>
And now, I'm thinking,
she may have just lost it for us.
{\an8}[RuPaul] The cast of <i>MacBitch</i>.
Places, people. Places, people.
Let's make magic.
Yes.
-Action!
-[beep]
Friends, drag queens, hunty men.
Cheerleader tryouts are happening today.
Uh, cut. Pearl, is that your normal voice?
-No, I deepened it a bit...
-You deepened it.
-...for the character.
-You shouldn't do that.
You are the narrator of this thing.
-Everyone will look at you.
-Okay.
With that lame-ass whistle.
Hey, Hogwarts rejects,
what's your prediction?
-"The spirit."
-The spirits
[both speaking] have spoken.
We saw it in a dream.
-[both] Lady MacBitch is the...
-[Kandy Ho] New cheer supreme.
[beep]
Watch out, sisters.
I'm the real prima donna.
-Oh.
-"Head cheerleader."
Head... Head cheerleader... Oh, fuck!
Head cheerleader is gonna be me. Ki...
Head cheerleader is gonna be me,
Laquisha Keanni.
-Cut. It's about that rhyme.
-It's really a rhythm.
It's: "Watch out, sisters.
I'm the real prima donna.
Head cheerleader is gonna be me,
Laquisha Keanna."
Watch out, sisters. I'm prim... Oh!
Keep going.
Watch out, sisters. I'm the queen...
I'm the real prima donna.
Head coach is gonna... Head cheerleader
is gonna be me, Laquisha Quian... Fuck!
So we're gonna move on.
{\an8}Oh, my God. I'm like...
like when is this gonna be over?
-Okay, here we go.
-[beep]
Tastes like burning...
[Renaissance music playing]
Basic witches not wanted.
-What is happening?
-I'm lost.
[Katya] <i>It was a domino effect. One</i>
<i>screwed up, then another screwed up</i>
<i>and then this person doesn't know</i>
<i>what to do.</i>
It's a mess.
Kennedy, did you rehearse your team?
I got to tell you, in seven seasons
of doing <i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i>,
I have never seen
a car crash like this before.
I don't know what to tell you, ladies.
This is not good.
Everybody on my team
is in deep shit right now.
[gunshot]
{\an8}You ready for another day in paradise?
{\an8}It's elimination day and I'm feeling
horrible. Yesterday, my team sucked.
{\an8}Worst day of my life.
Like, someone bring me a puppy.
{\an8}I want to die.
-How we doing, Miss Jasmine?
-You know, I don't like to be, like,
-I don't know my shit.
-Right.
So it was just like, fuck!
I think you just need
to turn that gown out and give it to them.
{\an8}I was part of a team that was the worst
in the whole entire history
<i>of Drag Race. But I know for a fact</i>
this dress is the best gown that ever
walked down the runway of a drag race.
I wouldn't be surprised if Ru got up
and said: "Bitch,
just because of that gown, girl,
you're safe as fuck."
[laughs] Who the hell are you?
I say: "I'm Trixie Mattel."
And they say: "Who?"
-They're like: "Who?"
-Right, yeah.
Yes!
These young girls
ain't been through nothing. And, girl,
it's getting on my nerves.
You have to discover
what your aesthetic is.
{\an8}Girl. Please, honey. Find one.
[laughter]
-They don't even know who they are yet.
-They don't.
-What's that color one?
-What? Oh, Violet.
-Yeah, that one.
-Lavender.
Tacky drag.
{\an8}<i>Mrs. Kasha Davis, Jasmine,</i>
<i>Kennedy and myself,</i>
{\an8}we just call ourselves
the bitter old lady brigade.
But we don't mean any harm, girl.
Except when we do.
It worries me,
the younger ones don't get it.
And then they get hit hard
with what comes afterwards.
People tell me:
"Why do you take drag so seriously?
You're not curing cancer."
No, but I'm making it easier to live with.
-Right.
-This one woman came up
and we said: "What are you celebrating?"
She said: "My bucket list."
She'd been diagnosed with terminal cancer
and wanted to go and see a drag show.
They gave her two weeks to live.
She came for a year.
And we were like: "You know, one day,
she's not gonna come." And she didn't.
We found out she'd been taken
to hospice, so we put together
the entire show, drove over to hospice,
and gave that girl one last show.
It's stuff like that makes it worthwhile.
Somebody needs that.
-Right.
-When you're on stage,
you're ministering somebody
in some type of way.
I just had a meltdown.
I broke down right there on stage,
crying, acting a fool.
And, honey, if I have to lip-synch,
I'm gonna give that my all,
because I didn't come here to go home.
{\an8}I worked so hard to get here.
This is my dreams and my goals.
Everything is at stake right now.
They'll need security,
escort me out, honey.
It will be a real drag show
because they'll drag me off the stage.
I ain't going home.
No ma'am, no ham, no cauliflower,
no corn bread, no green beans.
I'm not going home.
[beats]
[RuPaul laughing]
[Mel B squeals]
Welcome to the main stage
of <i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i>.
{\an8}My wife, Michelle Visage. Thanks
for being my beard for all these years.
-Please don't ever shave me.
-[RuPaul giggling]
{\an8}Sir Carson Kressley,
are you ready to tame some shrews?
-Bring me the shrews!
-[RuPaul laughing]
My favorite broke girl,
and I know a lot of them.
{\an8}-Kat Dennings is here.
-This is the best day of my life, Ru.
And the spiciest girl of all,
from <i>America's Got Talent</i>, Mel B.
{\an8}Welcome to my show,
<i>America's Got Drag Queens</i>.
I'm so bloody excited,
I cannot even tell you.
This week, we challenged our queens
to hamlet it up
in two twisted Shakespeare classics.
And tonight, they're ready to gag us
with the hair on their chinny chin chins.
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best bearded woman win.
[dance music playing]
{\an8}[RuPaul] Max.
{\an8}[Mel B] I love the beard.
[Max] <i>I'm trying to channel some</i>
<i>Tim Burton, 1920s editorial Salvador Dalí.</i>
-[Michelle] Touch-gay!
-[Carson] Surely, you joust.
[RuPaul laughs]
{\an8}[RuPaul] Ginger Minj.
{\an8}[Michelle] Is it a merkin in your pocket
or are you happy to see me?
[Ginger Minj] <i>I am trying so hard</i>
<i>to remain elegant with this beard,</i>

<i>Who knew I was a model?</i>

{\an8}Trixie Mattel.
{\an8}Bearded for the cause.
[Michelle] Heavenly.
<i>I just stepped out of an oil painting</i>
<i>and I'm taking him to church.</i>
[Michelle] And now, with wings.
[RuPaul laughs]
[RuPaul] Is she a ZZ top or a ZZ bottom?
{\an8}Mr. and Mrs. Kasha Davis.
{\an8}[laughter]
[Kasha] <i>This isn't the bearded lady</i>
<i>from the circus.</i>
<i>She's a socialite with a lot of diamonds.</i>

{\an8}-[RuPaul] Jaidynn Diore Fierce.

[Jaidynn] <i>I am serving</i>

<i>Come on, bearded queen.</i>
-[RuPaul] All shade, all Mr. T.
-[Michelle] I pity the queen.
{\an8}-[RuPaul] Miss Fame.
-[Mel B] I want that waist and the outfit.
[Miss Fame] <i>This is my take</i>
<i>on the classic harlequin look. </i>
<i>I'm feeling stunning.</i>
[Kat] Uh... Oh!
What's so funny?
[RuPaul] She's, like, a cross between
Ginger Grant and Ulysses S. Grant.
[laughter]
{\an8}[RuPaul] LaGuardia Newark Kennedy.
The artist formerly known
as Kennedy Davenport.
[RuPaul] Yeah. [laughs]
[Kennedy] <i>My hair is deep-waved</i>
<i>with my beard, honey.</i>
<i>I'm feeling fierce.</i>
-[Carson] Use the beaver as a swiffer.
-[RuPaul] If you got one, flaunt it.
-Right, Michelle?
-How do you think I got here?
[laughter]
{\an8}[RuPaul] Katya. Yowza! Babe-raham Lincoln.
[Katya] <i>I'm giving you</i>
<i>emancipation proclamation realness.</i>
<i>I'm coming for the south. I'm coming</i>
<i>for the north. I'm coming for everybody.</i>
[Michelle] Don't go to the theater!
[laughter]
{\an8}-[RuPaul] Jasmine Masters.
-[all oohing]
[Mel B] I need that dress.
[Jasmine] <i>Look at this gown, gag over it,</i>
<i>because there's nothing else you can do.</i>
-[RuPaul] It's very "lumber-jackee."
-[Michelle] It's me, Jasmine.
[RuPaul imitating Jackée]
Ooh, the shade of it all.
{\an8}[RuPaul] Pearl. The devil made her do it.
[Pearl] <i>I am giving you</i>
<i>papier mâché bearded lady, she-devil.</i>
[Mel B] I love

[RuPaul] Not today, Satan.

-[RuPaul] Yes.
-[laughter]
-[RuPaul] Who doesn't love a hairy box?
-[Michelle] My husband.
-[Kandy Ho] <i>My look is kind of dark.</i>
<i>I want them to see a darker side of me.</i>
Fu man-chu better work.
[Kat laughs]
{\an8}-[RuPaul] Violet.
-[Michelle gasps]
{\an8}[RuPaul] Peggy Sue got hairy.
[Michelle laughs]
[Violet] <i>I'm giving you 1956 Dior,</i>
<i>haute couture poses</i>
<i>on point. Everything is to a T.</i>
[Michelle] She's bringing her beard
to the prom. Where's the pig blood?
Welcome back, ladies.
It's time to debut
the greatest love story of all time,
<i>Romy and Juliet.</i>
Starring Team Max.
[Renaissance music playing]
In a world of charisma
uniqueness, talent, and nerve,
two rival drag houses
are gonna get on they swerve.
First day of school.
House of Capulet's gonna rule.
-Drag mother, who's there? Do you know?
-Juliet,
pay her no mind.
It's that skank Romy-ho.
-Soft, but what light do break?
-I'm Juliet,
but what's in a name?
You can call me Cupcake.
-Okay?
-[both gasping]
Oh, chill out, you two.
You're from enemy crews.
You'll get yourself banished
if you hang with this flooz.
What did you say? RuPaul-ogize, trolls.
Calm down, Beyoncé,
or I'll clock those back
-rolls.
-[all gasp]
<i>The queen-on-queen rumble</i>
<i>turned into a thriller.</i>
Meanwhile, later that night
at Juliet's villa...
-Wherefore art thou, Romy, yo!
-Be still, sweet Juliet.
But how is she, though?
-Romy, let's live forever.
-Do you fancy a shag?
Yes, god. On your eleganza
I gag! [gasps]
-[sniffs and gags]
-Oh, girl, you really gagging.
Oh, wait. Status update: dead.
There we go. [moans]
[gasps]
Oh, man. We never even got to kaikai.
And with this death drop, I do die.
[moans]
Romy, girl!
Why?
Teenage suicide...
Don't do it.
[sniffles] I just...
I promised myself I wouldn't cry.
[laughter]
Well done, ladies. Next up, <i>MacBitch</i>.
Starring Team Kennedy Davenport.
[Renaissance music playing]
Here in Tuckahoe,
it's the season of the witch... [sniffs]
but none are as shady as Lady MacBitch.
[laughter]
Friends, drag queens, hunty men.
[blows the whistle]
I got something to say.
Cheerleading tryouts are happening today.
Watch out, sisters.
I'm the real prima donna
Head cheerleader is gonna be me,
Laquisha Keanna. That's right!
Girl, not on tonight.
This is so not your gig.
I'm lady MacBitch
and you're a pig in a wig.
Hey, Hogwarts rejects,
what's your prediction?
If I'm not head cheerleader,
it's purely fan fiction.
The spirits have spoken.
We saw in a dream.
Lady MacBitch is the cheer team supreme.
Wicked, please.
Attention, cheer trolls.
Let the tryouts begin.
Start your engines.
May the best Tuckahoe win!
-Basic witches not wanted.
-Oh, sisters, I'm stressed.
If I don't win, I may die.
Try this. It'll help.
It's Oprah's new chai.
[whispering] With a shot of drain cleaner.
Well, all right, Mary MacBitch.
Give it a go. You're up first.
Okay. Give me a T. Give me a U.
Give me a...
[gags]
Byeeeee!
[blows the whistle]
U-G-L-Y. You ain't got no alibi. You ugly.
Tragic.
[dramatic music playing]
Well, there you have it, ladies,
master-queef theater.
{\an8}It was hard to watch.
I'm trying to black it out.
The reviews are in, and one production
are all safe from elimination.
Team Max, condragulations.
-Good work, guys.
-Jaidynn Diore Fierce,
-kudos for working through your fears.
-Thank you, Ru.
And for your dual role as team leader
and the tallest Juliet in herstory,
Max, you are the winner
of the challenge.
[applause]
You've won two couture latex outfits
<i>from Syren Latex,</i>
<i>a leader in latex fashions.</i>
{\an8}This is the perfect ending
to a good week. It feels grand.
Now, get thee to a nunnery.
[electronic music playing]
Team Kennedy Davenport,
you are all up for elimination.
-First up, Kennedy.
-I have to say, the runway outfit
is probably my least favorite
of all of the contestants.
-Oh!
-Your performance...
the fact that you were the team leader
and your team was a disaster.
-What the hell happened?
-It was a shock to me as well.
During your rehearsal,
couldn't you sense
-that it wasn't even going right?
-Nobody knew their lines.
Well, that was pretty evident.
-Moving on. Katya.
-You knew your lines.
You delivered it okay
and for this group, it's a lot.
Your choice on the runway
shows intelligent humor.
The hair, the beard,
the whole entire look...
-Flawless for me.
-Thank you.
All right, Jasmine Masters.
Oh, what a gorgeous gown!
-Thank you.
-You just look unbelievable,
and I'm sure the dress weighs 100 pounds.
-Yes, it does.
-Your beard is the most disturbing to me,
-and it looks like a chin strap.
-I don't glue stuff to my face.
The slightest thing will break me out.
I didn't want to take that chance
and put something on my face and going
to the hospital because my skin broke out.
Your Shakespearean performance wasn't fun
to watch, we could kind of see
-that you were having a hard time.
-I knew my lines,
but they didn't come out
how they should.
You did not know your lines.
Next up, Pearl.
Your look makes a statement,
and you're the only one
that used
some really creative materials.
You were a cheerleading coach,
and you were, like, lifeless
and borderline dead.
I like borderline dead. I find it great.
-Once.
-I've only seen it once.
I mean, it was rough.
The domino effect was real.
But you had the first word.
So if you have a domino effect,
you started it.
Yeah. Sorry. Thanks.
-Next up, Kandy Ho.
-Hello.
Yay on the contouring.
Don't think I haven't noticed.
You changed your face and it shows.
-Thank you.
-It's pretty, and now we see you.
-Isn't it funny?
-That's the irony, she wears a beard.
-For the beard challenge...
-She fixes her contour.
I liked the nerdy kind of twist you did
with the tape on the glasses.
-I think you did a fantastic job.
-Thank you.
Next up, Violet Chachki.
I love that Dior silhouette, girl.
You look very elegant and pretty,
and that's hard to do with a full beard.
[RuPaul laughs] Yeah.
Lady MacBitch just fell flat.
How can anyone be crap at being a bitch?
It was a hard day for everybody.
Why is everyone saying a rough day?
Haven't we had days when we just
have to pull it out
and just deal with it and be professional?
Um...
I'll say this. I specifically remember
turning to Kennedy
and saying: "Should we run it as a group?"
And she shot me down and said:
"No," and that was
the root of our problem.
I'll take responsibility as a leader.
But as far as taking correction,
I'm not gonna take their blame.
You know, FYI,
for all of you girls up there,
I don't want to hear any god damn excuses.
-Be prepared!
-We didn't have time to re-rehearse.
Make it work. Make it work.
Fucking make it happen! I don't want
to hear any goddamn excuses anymore!
[sighs]
Having said that, my children,
while you untuck backstage,
the judges and I will deliberate.
Just between us, spice girls,
what do you think?
Let's start with Kennedy Davenport.
It looked like she had some pubes
that she glued to her face
-and that was it.
-As a performer...
-Thesbian.
-As a thesp... thesbian...
-I heard that about you.
-What a mistake to not run
-the play as a group.
-It was a mess
from top to bottom.
I don't like messy bottoms.
[laughter]
-[Rupaul]<i> Katya.</i>
-She was consistently delivering.
I think she's always ready,
willing, and abe-le.
[laughs]
-[RuPaul]<i> Jasmine Masters.</i>
-As a fan of the show,
the biggest fan of all time,
it's so frustrating
<i>when you watch someone talented</i>
<i>get in their own way so much</i>
-and they can't pull out of it.
-You have to make it work.
Work. Work it out.
I don't know what it is,
but I really like Jasmine.
[RuPaul] All right.
Let's move on to Pearl.
Her role... I think she was trying
to be, like, a couture football player.
[Michelle] <i>The pants had</i>
<i>this gaping crotch that kept</i>
-grabbing my eyes.
-I saw that. Yeah.
Then, when her lines came,
it was like, "Hark.
-Who goes there?"
-[laughter]
This performance
brought to you by Lithium.
[RuPaul] <i>Kandy Ho.</i>
This will sound shocking,
but I actually enjoyed her hairy box.
-[laughter]
-[Carson] <i>Immensely.</i>
She did seem like one of the only people
having a good time.
-She's an enigma.
-Wait, what did you call me?
-[laughter]
-You better watch it.
-[RuPaul]<i> Violet Chachki.</i>
-I don't want to be a MacBitch about it.
However, she is the one
I remember the least.
Come on.
We can all be a bitch. She wasn't.
-Rude.
-[Michelle laughs]
Silence! I've made my decision.
Bring back my shakes-beards.
Welcome back, ladies.
I've made some decisions.
Kandy Ho...
You're safe.
Katya...
-You're safe, Mr. President.
-[whispers] Thank you.
Jasmine Masters,
your Shakespeare performance
was a tragedy.
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
Violet Chachki...
-You're safe.
-Thank you.
Kennedy Davenport, you were team leader,
and heavy is the head
that wears the crown.
Pearl, you've been sleepwalking.
Consider tonight your wake-up call.
Wake up, Pearl.
Wake up.
Pearl...
You're safe.
[dramatic music playing]
Kennedy, my dear, I'm sorry,
but you are up for elimination.
{\an8}I don't want to go up against Jasmine.
That's my sister.
You know, we have a bond.
Two queens stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me and save yourself...
from elimination.
The time has come...
for you to lip-synch for your life.
Good luck and don't fuck it up.
{\an8}I just don't want to lip-synch
against my own sister,
but I want to show the world
what I can do.
-[RuPaul laughs]
{\an8}It's so hard to watch
two of my best judies in this competition
going at it,
knowing that one of them is gonna go home.
[applause]
[RuPaul laughs]
Ladies, I've made my decision.
Kennedy Davenport. Shantay, you stay.
You may join the other girls.
Jasmine, girl, you are a prima donna
and a true diva.
I know that's right,
and you best believe it.
Now, sashay away.
[applause]
<i>If it was another girl that sent me home,</i>
<i>I'd be pissed off about it. </i>
<i>But knowing that I lost</i>
<i>to my sister, Kennedy,</i>
I'm walking away
from this experience happy.
<i>I know she will knock</i>
<i>those bitches out,</i>
<i>no tea, no shade, no pink lemonade.</i>
{\an8}[RuPaul] My queens, remember,
if you can't love yourself,
{\an8}how in the hell you'll love somebody else?
Can I get an amen up in here?
{\an8}[all] Amen.
{\an8}Now, if music be the food of love,
play on!
{\an8}Byeeeeee!


{\an8}[RuPaul] <i>Previously</i>
<i>on</i> RuPaul's Drag Race.
{\an8}This is the most draggedy
season premiere ever.
{\an8}You'll be making your main stage debut
{\an8}naked and afraid.
{\an8}No tea, no shade, no pink lemonade,
{\an8}but you don't want to see
these girls up in here naked.
[RuPaul] Tempest DuJour.
You're wrinkly. You're droopy.
[RuPaul] Violet Chachki.
You have the essence of crazy,
skinny models that may not have boobs.
[RuPaul] Kandy Ho.
It looks like you literally
contoured on a beard.
No.
Violet Chachki, you are
the winner of this week's challenge.
Kandy Ho, shantay, you stay.
Tempest DuJour, sashay away.
{\an8}[tense music playing]
{\an8}-Whew. My goodness.
-Oh, my God.
{\an8}We're back in the workroom,
and Tempest has gone home.
{\an8}"You're never too old to dream."
{\an8}The reality of the situation
is hitting all of us.
{\an8}Every challenge,
somebody's got to go home.
{\an8}-[Kasha] Was it nerve-racking?
-[Kandy] No, I knew I was gonna win.
{\an8}-Oh, my God.
-[Kandy] Bye, Tempest.
{\an8}[Kandy] <i>I'm not gonna let</i>
<i>this first lip sync break my confidence.</i>
{\an8}I need to show the judges
that I do have what it takes.
Well, condragulations, girl.
{\an8}-How does that feel?
-I hate Michelle Visage.
-What?
-Girl.
What she said
just rubbed me the wrong way.
I would have liked to see it
zhooshed a little 'cause I'm getting boy.
She probably has a bigger man body
than I do without her implants.
[Jasmine] Don't go there, girl.
{\an8}Of course Michelle Visage
is gonna judge you. It's her job.
You'll get negative criticism
no matter what.
[Violet] It wasn't tasteful.
It was like, "Ew, Michelle."
{\an8}Michelle seems underwhelmed
with what I was doing,
{\an8}<i>but I impressed myself.</i>
{\an8}[blows raspberry]
-I thought you was gonna win.
-I mean, there has to be a winner,
and I think that your win was valid.
I stand by that.
-I'm not sitting here mad about it.
-A little bit.
{\an8}Did the judges get it right?
<i>Pause, pause, pause.</i>
Maybe not.
-[Kandy] Well, congratulations, girl.
-[Violet] Oh, girl, yes.
Are you mad at me?
{\an8}Tonight, Sasha threw me
under the bus on the stage.
Which queen
has least impressed you thus far?
I'd have to say Pearl.
I expect to be hated on.
I wasn't expecting it so soon,
because she's been cool
to my face the whole time.
-Whatever. It's all good.
-Well, obviously it's not.
Half of me saying Pearl's name
was strategy
because Pearl is
one of my biggest competitors,
and half of it was 'cause she acts
like she doesn't want to be here.
I get it. You're playing the game.
-You should be.
-I don't want an evil game,
-but I'm--
-Whatever.
Okay, well, never mind.
[Pearl] <i>If I was her,</i>
<i>I wouldn't want me to be here either.</i>
I'm pretty, and she looks
like fricking John Goodman in a wig.
[engine revs]
[RuPaul] <i>The winner receives</i>
<i>a one-year supply</i>
<i>of Anastasia Beverly Hills Cosmetics</i>
<i>and $100,000.</i>
<i>With extra-special guest judges</i>
<i>Jordin Sparks and Olivia Newton-John.</i>
{\an8}[tires screeching]
[dance music playing]
Oh, girl. You're gonna run me
into the wall. You're shady.
[Max] <i>Well, it is a new week,</i>
<i>and I'm just optimistic.</i>
{\an8}It's a drag competition.
{\an8}If you're not having fun,
then you're not doing it right.
Miss Fame? How are you doing
without your husband?
Oh, girl, I miss him dearly,
but I'm surviving.
Y'all cuddle up a bit too much
for my comfort. I need an adult.
[siren blaring]
[RuPaul] <i>She done</i>
<i>already done had herses.</i>
<i>Hey, fly girls.</i>
<i>America's next drag superstar</i>
<i>needs to work the runway</i>
<i>and show me some sass.</i>
<i>Then, I'll bump your booty up</i>
<i>from coach to first class.</i>
<i>But remember,</i>
<i>if you want me to warm your nuts,</i>
<i>well, that's gonna cost you extra.</i>
[engine roars]
I don't even know what first class is.
-Hello, hello, hello.
-Hi.
Condragulations, ladies.
For today's mini challenge,
you need to give face, face, face,
while the pit crew blows you.
With a leaf blower.
-[Jasmine] Damn.
-[RuPaul] Oh, pit crew.
[Ginger] Girl, I'm from Florida.
I have survived many a hurricane,
but never one
that's been blowing me in the mouth.
Now, the two most unflappable queens
with the most flappable faces will win.
You have 15 minutes to get into drags.
Ready, set, go.
[dance music playing]
We're never gonna pick up
hot men looking like this.
[RuPaul] All right, time's up, ladies.
Now, to help judge today's mini challenge,
give a big drag-race welcome
{\an8}to my good friend, music superstar Moby.
{\an8}Hello.
-Hello.
-Hello, my darling.
Look at all these beautiful people.
Hi, everybody.
I feel short and homeless next to you.
Well, and rightfully so.
All right, ladies, show of hands.
Who wants to get blown first?
[RuPaul] Pit crew,
let it rip.
[blower whirrs]
{\an8}[dubstep music playing]
{\an8}[RuPaul laughing]
{\an8}Gone with the weave!
{\an8}[RuPaul laughing]
{\an8}That's right, get your second wind, girls.
{\an8}[RuPaul laughing]
{\an8}Oh, cheeky.
{\an8}[RuPaul laughing]
{\an8}[RuPaul laughing]
{\an8}Oh, my God. She's such a blowhard.
{\an8}[RuPaul laughing]
{\an8}[RuPaul laughing]
Wow.
I think that's the dumbest thing
I've ever done in my entire life.
The two winners
of today's mini challenge are...
Ginger Minj and Trixie Mattel.
Condragulations, ladies.
We'll be posting these gifs
at logotv.com.
Now, for this week's maxi challenge,
get ready for a lip sync-a-palooza,
as you'll be performing
a mashup of spoken word and song,
{\an8}the safety preflight video
for #GlamazonianAirways,
the first airlines
run completely by drag queens.
You'll be working in two teams.
Ginger and Trixie,
since you won the mini challenge,
you get to pick the crews
and assign the parts.
-Ginger, you pick first.
-I'll take Sasha Belle.
Yes!
I'm a Pearl girl.
[Ginger] Take Miss Jasmine.
-Miss Lame.
-Hi, boo.
-Mrs. Kasha Davis.
-Thank you, darling.
-Miss Katya.
-Yes.
-Miss Jaidynn Diore Fierce.
-Yes, ma'am.
-Well, Ru, I'm all Maxed out.
-Yes.
[Ginger] I'll take
Miss Kennedy Davenport.
[RuPaul] That leaves
Violet and Kandy Ho.
[Violet] <i>I won the first challenge,</i>
so I don't really understand
why they are not choosing me.
Violet.
Which means, Kandy Ho,
you're on Ginger's team.
[Kandy] <i>What the hell?</i>
You're underestimating what I can do.
I've got to catch a flight,
so I'm gonna make this really quick.
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.
-See ya!
-Bye.
Here's part one,
so we can all listen together.
-Does anyone lip-sync extremely well?
-Duh.
For the first part, where it's two girls
who start singing together,
I think you guys should look like--
We got to figure it out soon, because--
Should we all just listen?
Because when we're talking,
we're not what? Listening.
{\an8}Violet has been rubbing me
the wrong way.
Whatever you say,
she needs to snap back at you,
and it's like, "All right,
public school. Calm down."
Is anybody not a dancer at all?
I'm not not a dancer,
but I'm not a dancer.
So are you a dancer?
There's definitely
a tense sort of air with Violet
<i>that can have an effect</i>
<i>on our energy as a group.</i>
Positive energies, positive energies,
positive energies.
Yeesh!
{\an8}[Ginger] We should listen to it,
kind of get an idea,
{\an8}-and then we'll assign parts.
-[Jasmine] Yeah.
{\an8}Our challenge this week
is to do a live lip sync
<i>in front of the judges with choreography.</i>
This is right on my alley.
What'll make the first part pop
when we're all singing together,
we should get our vowel movement...
Our vowel movements synced up.
So I'll be 7, so I could do
the thing about the padded ass.
My pants are out to here.
I think 13 and 11 should be
Jasmine and Kennedy.
[Jasmine] I'm down.
-I like the scat.
-I bet you do.
I think looks-wise,
I want to have you do the scat thing.
Are there any questions about that?
Let's try one more again.
{\an8}Ginger gives the scat part to Kasha.
-And you could be... twelve.
-Twelve.
I think I'm most concerned about
having such a small part.
{\an8}[Kasha] Sasha doesn't like the role
that she's been cast. She's meh.
{\an8}[scoffs]
{\an8}Exhausting.
-Hello, hello, hello.
-Hi.
-So, Ginger, you're the leader.
-Uh-huh.
What made you pick this team?
I wanted to go for a team
that was not only talented,
but also very diverse.
If you look at the other team,
they look like Aryan Airlines.
[laughter]
Now, has any of you girls
not done spoken-word lip-syncing?
-I don't think I have.
-You have not?
You don't think you have?
Okay. All right.
Did you assign the parts,
or did you let your team choose
what they wanted to do?
I assigned them.
I made sure everybody
was comfortable with their role
because I want everybody
to be able to express themselves.
-What are you most worried about?
-Well, I'm not a dancer.
I'm gonna throw that out there now.
If I fall, y'all better not showgirls me.
You better pick me up.
{\an8}To be the one who is leading
this team in a dance number...
All right, get to it.
...if something goes down,
I'm going down with it.
-[RuPaul] Hey, ladies.
-[all] Hi, Ru.
-Hi.
-Hi.
-So, Trixie, you're our team leader.
-An amazing team.
-You have a theater background.
-Yeah. This is my gig.
And any other girls
have acting experience?
-Miss Fame, any acting?
-Not yet.
I've had some opportunities
that could be considered
an entryway to acting,
but not to the degree that I'd like to see
my future evolve into.
You just described a Craigslist ad.
{\an8}I'm worried about Fame because
she has hardly any performing experience,
{\an8}so she looks amazing,
but can she deliver on stage?
Katya, don't you have a dance background?
A little bit. I wouldn't call myself
a "dancer," per se,
but I can move my body
in a compelling way.
Usually it compels people
to leave the room but...
-All right, get to work.
-Thank you.
All right, gather round,
sexy stewardesses. Gather round.
In a moment, you'll meet
with choreographer Jamal Sims.
So I expect your charisma,
uniqueness, nerve, and talent
to be on fire!
Don't fuck it up. All right, bye.
[dance music playing]
{\an8}-Ladies.
-[Violet] Hi.
How's everybody doing?
Marvelous.
-Who's queen one?
-That's me.
You have your whole speech?
The first thing that I'm freaking out
about is, of course,
memorizing my lines.
-And let's go.
-Welcome aboard, welcome aboard.
[mumbling]
I have a fucking monologue.
I'm the first impression.
I'm the first part of this group.
If I fuck it up, I could go home.
[Jamal] Violet, you're gonna come center,
and then when you say,
"They're there to make you skinny,"
you're gonna take it and tighter
all the way around her,
and you're, like, "It is skinny."
All right, here we go.
[Jamal] Everybody sing.
-[Jamal] Okay.
-[Violet] Bitch, pull it tight.
Get it right on that waist.
{\an8}I have the smallest waist
in <i>Drag Race</i> history.
<i>I want people to see it.</i>
[Violet] Really tighten it.
[Pearl] I don't have time to tighten it
all the way, run around you,
and tuck it into your belt.
Tighten it all the way.
{\an8}Don't tell me what to do
and don't get an attitude with me.
You're not the only one
dancing on the stage right now.
[Jamal] Pearl and Miss Fame, take center.
Can I put this in the pocket while we...
I'm just trying to take this all in.
{\an8}I'm feeling a little bit nervous.
<i>I can dance at the club</i>
<i>and get a husband,</i>
but I don't...
I'm not a choreograph dancer.
[Jamal] All right, you guys go
shake, shake, shake.
So booty, booty, booty, booty.
Five, six, seven, eight, hit.
[Miss Fame] Oh, lost it.
So Miss Fame, her execution is so bad.
There's no rhythm. There's no musicality.
-Just that, that, that.
-Like that?
Her hips don't move
like a woman's hip should move.
[Jamal] "There are two in the front
and only one in the..."
Uh-oh. Something happened here.
{\an8}Pearl and Fame are not together,
{\an8}and neither are doing
the choreo correctly, which is bad.
[Jamal] "There are two in the front
and only one in the rear."
This way.
-All right, this is already wrong.
-Oh, sorry.
We've got to get you guys in sync,
because right now it's looking like...
-A mess.
-Yeah.
-Yes.
-All right, let's go again.
[Trixie] <i>They're not dancers,</i>
<i>but they better get it now,</i>
because we don't have time
to struggle with the choreography.
{\an8}[Jamal] Hey, hey, hey.
{\an8}-Team Ginger's in the house.
-Something like that.
[Ginger] <i>When I lead</i>
<i>our group in for our rehearsal,</i>
<i>and I see Jamal standing there,</i>
{\an8}I about flood my basement,
'cause that is one good-looking man.
The choreography goes like this.
I can't do that.
It's just a rehearsal.
It's doing it over and over again.
Let's try it all together.
Let me see what that looks like.
From the top.
Ginger's like a bull in a china shop,
but when she's doing the choreo,
she becomes a mouse.
I keep getting caught up on that thing.
I'm thinking about it before I get there,
so I'm kind of screwed.
I could tell that.
You look scared in the front.
[laughs]
Let's do it again. Here we go.
Come on. Say, ah, ah, ah...
I'm gonna slide. I'ma have to put
some slippy slides on the bottom.
Yeah, we gonna have to do
something with them shoes.
I need you to not be in your head,
you know what I mean?
And I see it with you. You know,
you have to let all of your things go.
I need you to sell it right now.
I had a knee injury last year.
I'm not trying to make any excuses,
but I did have a knee injury last year,
so I'm kind of still scared.
[Ginger] I picked my big girl sister,
Jaidynn, to be on my team
because I feel like there's solidarity
in solid girls,
but all I want to do is, I don't know,
call in a bomb threat or something
and hopefully we can postpone the show.
[lounge music playing]
-Girl, another day.
-Someone's going home.
[Ginger] How about the other team?
What do you guys still got to work on?
Honestly, we've...
Everything was really smooth.
How's that going for you?
Because I know you're not a performer.
What do you mean?
Well, you say. You're a fashion girl.
-But I still have to evoke emotion.
-But you don't have to do that,
-and one, two, step all the time.
-True. I mean...
Be careful the things that you say.
You have to remember,
-all this talking you be doing.
-Right.
[Miss Fame] <i>Some of them</i>
<i>are selling me short.</i>
<i>I've been hired to work</i>
<i>and do drag at clubs,</i>
<i>but I want to push the boundaries</i>
<i>of where drag can go.</i>
{\an8}I want to be the supermodel in drag.
We have strengths in other departments.
That's why we're all here together.
[Jasmine] A drag queen performs,
unless you just playing dress up.
It's not about trying to be pretty.
It's about entertaining.
But some of us don't want to be
at the club for the rest of our career.
[Jaidynn] Oh!
-Bitch, you in the wrong competition.
-You right, girl. You right.
[Ginger] Whoo!
I just wanted to call it
like I see it with Miss Fame.
I didn't mean for everybody
to jump in at once and start a turf war.
It's not <i>West Side Story</i>.
[lounge music playing]
This is my first time in drag.
-It's actually kind of adorable.
-Shut up!
You look kind of the same.
Miss Fame, get your pictures real quick.
[Miss Fame] This is my husband, Patrick.
These are my mom. She didn't raise me.
She struggled with drugs and alcohol
throughout my entire life.
-[Violet] Your grandparents raised you?
-[Miss Fame] Yeah.
Sorry. This picture
is just getting me today.
I don't know why. It's so weird.
My grandfather was murdered
when I was 15, in high school.
Oh, my God.
I remember the phone call.
I couldn't comprehend that loss.
<i>It was so sudden.</i>
<i>That was the man that supported me</i>
<i>and raised me since I was six months old.</i>
It's like my... my soft spot is there.
{\an8}Miss Fame's been through a lot.
Overcoming all of that and being here
is an accomplishment in itself.
It must be really hard
to go through a lot like that.
-[Trixie] It's okay, girl.
-[Violet] We'll win this challenge.
We're fucking here to win it,
and you should be proud of yourself.
["Cover Girl" playing]
[RuPaul laughs]

Thank you. I am too. Thank you.
{\an8}And the one and only Olivia Newton-John.

I'm losing control. You look gorgeous.
Thank you so much.
We are so happy that you're here,
and we are hopelessly devoted to you.

{\an8}[RuPaul] <i>Please pay attention</i>

{\an8}<i>I'm Miss Valerie Valentine.</i>

<i>-It's a man!</i>
<i>-It's a woman!</i>
<i>-It's a man!</i>
<i>I believe they call them drag queens.</i>
[scream]
-[Olivia] That was great.
-[Trixie] <i>We rocked it.</i>
We shine like crazy,
and the judges saw that.
{\an8}[airplane engine roars]
-[alarm sounding]
<i>-This is only a test.</i>
[scream]
{\an8}<i>He used to take me to the cockpit.</i>
{\an8}<i>He'd blindfold me</i>

Welcome, ladies.
You performed in teams,
but tonight you'll be judged
as individuals.
[tense music playing]
Trixie Mattel. Max.
Pearl. Jasmine Masters.
Jaidynn Diore Fierce.
Kennedy Davenport. Kandy Ho.
Ladies, you are safe.
Please deplane to the backstage.
-Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.
-Loved your hair.
-Bye.
-Bye.
-Thanks for flying.
Is this your bag?
Ladies, you represent
the top and bottom of the week,
and now it's time
for the judges' critique.
First up, Katya.
You're like Hawaiian Barbie
airline flight attendant, and I love it.
[Michelle] But...
you were given the biggest monologue
and didn't know the words.
I don't know what the fuck happened.
When you're on a live performance,
just keep rolling with it,
because maybe people aren't noticing--
No, we noticed that. We noticed that.
-Next up, Violet Chachki.
-I love your outfit.
-[Carson] Her outfit's a little <i>Grease</i>-y.
-Sandy would love that.
You were so great in the skit.
It wasn't over the top. It was funny.
I noticed that you take yourself
rather seriously,
but underneath there's a clown.
So I'm waiting for her to come out.
Next up, Miss Fame.
I don't think the look says
"Jet Set Eleganza."
And the jewelry is gonna be
a real bitch at the TSA.
Just a heads up.
You were stiff. Maybe you were
uncomfortable with the choreo,
but that shouldn't be the reason
why you stand out.
We get that you're gorgeous,
you're a model.
Now you have got to loosen up.
Relax. Take your hands off your hips.
Yeah, there you are.
Next up, Ginger Minj.
You led your team
to what I think was a victory,
but explain to me how this dress says
"Jet Set Eleganza," please.
I picture this as something
that Elizabeth Taylor could wear.
-On an airplane?
-Of course.
-On her private jet.
-You have a huge personality
and a great charisma,
and you've got it.
Can I do something I've always wanted?
Yeah.
[deep voice] Sandy!
Next up, Sasha Belle.
I kind of lost you in the safety video,
except for when I did see the hair.
<i>That caught my eye,</i>
<i>'cause you kept trying to fix it.</i>
I get it. You don't want
something to just be hanging.
I love the big hair,
but it's so heavy in the front.
We can't see anything
that's going on the top part of you.
And you know, the dress,
it's just kind of shlumpy.
Next up, Mrs. Kasha Davis.
You were so alive.
You came out with so much energy.
You stayed in my mind.
I actually thought
you could have done more.
I wanted to see you really sit
on their tray tables.
-That's another show.
-Right. Yeah, okay.
-Jet Set Eleganza, I'm not getting it.
-No?
But what I am getting
is wife of the town lawyer.
He's taking you out to dinner, so you go
to Caché, and you get a nice dress.
Clocked.
Thank you, ladies. We've heard enough.
While you untuck backstage,
the judges and I will deliberate.
Just between us frequent flyers,
what do you think?
-[RuPaul] Katya.
-Jet Set Eleganza was adorable,
but she completely flubbed the words
on the largest monologue.
But I think she had good attitude.
[RuPaul] <i>Violet Chachki.</i>
Everything about her
is super poised and polished.
She grabbed me with her beauty
and her little seatbelt bit.
We got to see
a little glimmer of personality,
but there's so much more
that she's got to let bust out.
[RuPaul] <i>Miss Fame.</i>
She needs to just let it all hang out,
so to speak.
She's so concerned with looking beautiful
that she completely gets lost.
-[RuPaul] <i>Ginger Minj.</i>
-[Carson] <i>I didn't know it,</i>
but now I love minj, which I know
is one of the world's great ironies.
-Do you really love minj?
-I love the minj.
Put a little ginger on that,
I could eat it all day.
I love her personality, and she's a star.
But with that said,
Jet Set Eleganza... Meh.
-[RuPaul] <i>Sasha Belle.</i>
-[Olivia] <i>I feel sorry for her.</i>
She was going for the hair, and I thought,
"Stop, let it go. Take your hand away."
And then her Jet Set Eleganza.
Girl, nobody's sitting on a plane in that.
Everything seems
a little bit flat to me with her.
-Except her ass.
-Except her ass, yes.
[RuPaul] <i>Mrs. Kasha Davis.</i>
She upped her camp factor.
I was so happy with her.
That scat performance
was pretty impressive.
-Then, Jet Set Eleganza.
-You really hate this one.
It was so regular.
Well, she borrowed the outfit from me.
-Uh-oh.
-[Carson] Wah-wah.
Silence. I've made my decision.
Bring back my girls.
{\an8}[RuPaul laughs]
{\an8}[RuPaul laughs]
Welcome back, ladies.
I've made some decisions.
Sasha Belle, your performance
was a real departure
but to a destination unknown.
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
{\an8}[Sasha] This is a nightmare come true.
{\an8}I didn't come here
to be in the bottom two on week two.
Mrs. Kasha Davis,
-you're safe.
-Thank you.
Violet Chachki,
-you're safe.
-Thank you.
Ginger Minj, you love to fly,
and it shows.
Condragulations, you're the winner
of this week's challenge.
{\an8}You've won five-night
luxury hotel accommodations.
{\an8}-Courtesy of My Gay Getaway.
-Thank you.
{\an8}Winning means
absolutely everything to me,
{\an8}because it was something
that I was afraid to do,
and not only did I survive it,
I conquered it. It's a big day for me.
[RuPaul] Katya, your outfit is a Xana-do.
But your lip sync was a real Xana-don't.
Miss Fame,
you were on automatic pilot,
and you never landed it.
Katya,
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
-Miss Fame, you may join the others.
-Thank you.
Two queens stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me
and save yourself from elimination.
The time has come
for you to lip-sync
for your life!
{\an8}I'm about to perform a song
by Olivia Newton-John in front of her,
and I am sweating
like a hooker in church.
Good luck,
and don't fuck it up.
[Sasha] <i>I'm giving it my all.</i>
<i>I can barely move, but I'm working it.</i>
<i>I'm being funny. I want RuPaul</i>
<i>to see how much I want this.</i>
[Katya] <i>I definitely need</i>
<i>to make a statement,</i>
<i>so I pound my vagina into that stage</i>
<i>so hard that the building shakes.</i>
[Trixie] <i>Katya is doing splits,</i>
<i>slow splits, backbends. </i>
{\an8}The look is right. She's killing it.
[Olivia] All right.
[RuPaul] Ladies, I've made my decision.
[dramatic music playing]
-Katya, shantay, you stay.
-Thank you so much.
You may join the other girls.
Sasha Belle, a twist of fate
may have cut your time here short,
but keep on ringing them bells, girl.
Now, sashay away.
Thank you so much for everything.
[Sasha] I'm disappointed.
I think I overthought my strategy,
and I was going for the win,
so it sucks getting cut short.
Oh, they're gonna miss me.
{\an8}[RuPaul] Condragulations, ladies.
Remember,
{\an8}if you can't love yourself,
how you gonna love somebody else?
{\an8}Now spread your wings and fly tonight.
{\an8}Bye!

Thank you.
Let me tell you something.
Child, I am feeling mighty real tonight.
Mighty real. Are you ready
to crown America's next drag superstar?
Yeah. Good. But before we do,
I have one thing to say.
You better...
[blows the whistle]
[engine revs]
{\an8}[RuPaul] <i>The winner receives</i>
<i>a one-year supply</i>
{\an8}<i>of Anastasia Beverly Hills cosmetics</i>
{\an8}<i>and a cash prize of $100,000.</i>
{\an8}Welcome to the grand finale
of <i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i>.
{\an8}Tonight, the queendom has gathered
from far and near
{\an8}to help me crown
America's next drag superstar.
{\an8}In fact, we have the largest turnout ever.
Sixty queens, past and present,
under one roof. Now that's... Yes.
[cheers and applause]
Yes.
That's a lot of duct tape.
A lot of duct tape.
Hey, PorkChop.
Michelle Visage,
I see you brought the girls.
-I never leave home without them.
-[RuPaul] I meant Ross and Carson.
[both] Hi!
Now, tonight, we're doing
things a little differently.
Ginger Minj, Pearl, and Violet Chachki,
I have not, repeat,
I have not made my final decision.
So, to help me make up my mind,
I've asked each of you to prepare
a lip-sync performance
to a song created especially for you.
Ladies, this will be your last chance
to impress me and to prove to the world
that you have what it takes
to become America's next drag superstar.
Yes.
So, gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.
Welcome back to the grand finale
of <i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i>.
This season's race for the crown
is the tightest in herstory.
So I've challenged the top three queens
to perform one last time.
First up, get ready to pray and slay
with the right reverend Ginger Minj.
[RuPaul] Ginger Minj,
you just flooded my basement.
While you catch your breath,
let's talk to the judges. Michelle Visage,
-what did you think?
-Very Patti LaBelle. No, she better do.
-I'm very proud of you, Ginger Minj.
-Thank you.
You have always been an entertainer,
and that's how you got here.
-Congratulations, honey.
-Well, praise the Lord and hallelu-jer.
I still love the minj.
Well, thank you, judges.
Ginger, tonight, you took us to church,
but all season long, you've been taking us
on one wild ride. Let's take a look.
{\an8}Hi, fellas. I like to describe myself
as a glamour toad.
{\an8}She always wants to look neat,
petite, and ready to eat.
-I have low sugar.
-[laughter]
[Michelle] <i>She can give you comedy,</i>
<i>glamour, singing, and acting.</i>
<i>I mean, she's a quadruple threat.</i>
This is America. Land of the free,
home of the fat people.
If we're supersizing our French fries,
why not supersize our next drag superstar?
[laughter]
-You and the bitter old lady brigade...
-Oh, girl.
were throwing shade at the younger girls.
-Do you regret that?
-Well, let me say, I'm a size 22,
no matter which way the light hits me,
I'm gonna throw shade somewhere.
But, in all serious... You know,
when I was growing up, I came
from a very Southern, very practical,
church-going family, so I was
never encouraged to speak my mind
or ask questions.
Drag gave me my voice.
So I'm finally not afraid
to ask questions and say what I feel.
I know, girl, that I do come off
a little bit abrasive sometimes,
but it all comes
from a place of love. That's it.
All right. Good.
So I'll tell you what. We're gonna take
some questions from your fans.
[Darienne] Hi.
{\an8}Celeste from Richmond wants to know:
"Is it time for a big girl to win?"
{\an8}Well, it is time for a big girl to win,
but I don't want to win because I'm big,
but because I came in with guns a-blazing,
and I killed the competition.
So, you've got a lot of people
rooting for you. Let's take a look.
Hi, Ginger, this is your sister.
I've always known you were a star.
I hope America sees
what the family has always seen in you.
Hi, I'm John Waters,
and I'm here for Ginger Minj.
Congratulations on getting to the finals
of <i>RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
I'm rooting for you, and so is
Edith Massey from beyond the grave.
Hi, Ginger, it's mom.
I'm so proud of you.
I love watching you perform. I love you
so much, and congratulations. Bye!
Hey, Ginger, this is dad.
You know I've always been proud of you,
and I'm proud that you're my son,
and I've always tried to be there for you,
and I know sometimes I've failed at that,
but, you know, I'm a work in progress.
For you to think
that I don't approve of you
makes me feel like I failed as a father.
There's no way
that I don't approve of you.
Hopefully, tonight,
we can start two new chapters.
One, you winning everything
and going on to your fame and fortune,
something that you've worked...
[exhales deeply]
...you've worked very hard for.
And hopefully, we can start
another chapter, you and I,
and we can move on and bond together
from here forward. Sorry.
Nobody knows how hard he's worked.
He's very special.
Good luck tonight. I'm so proud of you.
And we'll definitely be watching.
[cheers and applause]
What does it feel like
to hear your father say those words?
{\an8}Other than my mom,
I never felt loved growing up.
{\an8}And I hope that this does lead to...
not only reconciliation, but...
a relationship that I never had.
[cheers and applause]
And I hope he feels bad enough
to buy me new bottom lashes
'cause these were custom.
So what would it mean to you
to become America's next drag superstar?
Oh, God. Who doesn't want
to be part of that legacy?
I mean, you've created something
that's so special for all of us.
And to even be considered
to be part of that is overwhelming.
Ginger, you are my kind
of plus-size queen.
You've got a big talent, a big heart,
and a big future ahead of you.
-I love you, Ginger.
-I love you too.
We all love the minj.
Welcome back to the grand finale
of <i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i>.
The final face-off
between our top three queens continues.
She started out as a sleeping beauty,
but will her fairy tale end with a crown?
Please welcome
everybody's favorite sleepwalker, Pearl.
-Good morning, Pearl.
-Good morning.
It's time to hear from the judges.
Michelle, what do you have to say?
You came into this competition,
you had a bit of an attitude,
but as time went on,
you became lovable, you became awake,
and you earned
your spot here in the final.
-You had to come out of your shell...
-Oh, look at you.
-Don't you love...
-Like a pearl, pearl in a shell.
But I think the audience has spoken,
and the people like you. They really do.
Congratulations.
You've come a long way, baby.
Let's take a look.
{\an8}'Sup? I would describe Pearl
as a robotic Stepford wife bitch.
<i>I've been drawing Pearl since I was ten.</i>
<i>Then one day, I just painted her on me.</i>
You've been sleepwalking.
Wake up, Pearl.
Wake up.
You kind of, like,
told me I had no personality.
Well, I'm hoping
it will light a fire under your ass.
-Do I have something on my face?
-Ah!
I had a rough childhood, okay?
I wasn't watching <i>Batman and Robin.</i>
[Michelle] <i>Someone set</i>
<i>their alarm clock and woke up.</i>
[RuPaul] <i>Well,</i> flazéda<i>.</i>
-<i>You're a weirdo.</i>
-[Pearl] <i>Oh, yeah.</i>
[RuPaul] <i>Boy, have you changed.</i>
Now, there's nothing
that could break my spirit.
Attagirl, Pearl.
[cheers and applause]
-So, Pearl, what made you wake up?
-You said something a long time ago.
It was like, "The fear of looking
stupid is really holding you back,"
and, yeah, I mean, I'm not a quitter.
And I wasn't about to quit on <i>Drag Race</i>.
Good, I'm glad you didn't.
Have you heard of this conspiracy theory
called the Curse of Pearl,
where any queen who crosses you
immediately goes home?
Yeah, it's been brought up.
You didn't go home though.
Uh, bitch...
The thing is, I actually...
I didn't cross you.
I almost just threw your ass
out of the door.
{\an8}Take a look at this.
Which queen has least impressed you?
I'd have to say Pearl.
[RuPaul] Sasha Belle, sashay away.
I noticed this black trim around her chin.
I'm thinking, "What the hell is that?"
[RuPaul] Jasmine, girl, sashay away.
There is this part of Pearl
that is too cool for season seven.
[RuPaul] Sashay away.
I can forgive her, but I'll never forget.
[RuPaul laughs]
-We have some questions from some fans.
-Oh.
Oh, look who's here. It's Alaska.
{\an8}Hi!
Hi!
'Sup?
Xavier from California wants to know:
"Pearl, is it just me,
or does everybody want to fuck you?"
I'm single. Single.
How do you deal
with the attention you've gotten?
I want people to like me
because I'm talented and I'm unique
and I have nerve,
and I have, you know, charisma,
or... not in that order. But thank you.
[RuPaul] Now,
you have a lot of people
in your corner. Let's take a look.
I have something on my face,
and it's a big smile of love,
pride, and joy
for my number-one grandson.
-Love you, Matty. From your grandma.
-Ah!
Hey, Pearl.
Chicago family sends you love.
-You've slayed all season.
-You've been killing it. We love you.
Come on, chin strap!
-We're so proud of you.
-So proud.
-We wish you all the luck in the world.
-We love you.
-Love you so much.
-Love you. More than anything.
I wanted to send you a quick message
letting you know how proud I am of you.
You have always been a special...
special little boy,
from the time you were two and three,
running around in your sister's tutu,
to the time that I knew
I was going to lose you to a big city.
I knew one thing would never change,
and that is my love for you.
I love you as my son.
I love you as Pearl.
And we could not be more proud of you.
And I am so happy
to have watched you go through this.
I love you, and we'll see you soon.
[cheers and applause]
Pearl, your mother is here.
I want to say hi to the mother of Pearl.
{\an8}-Hello, mother of Pearl.
-Hello, Ru.
{\an8}Now, you've gone over and above
for your support of Pearl. Tell us more.
One day, I thought,
"I should do a fan page."
Within just a few hours,
I was literally inundated
with private messaging
from younger gay boys, um...
Looking for sex.
-No, that's... that's <i>my</i> fan page.
-No, that's your fan page, right.
[Pearl's mother] I was messaged
by so many people.
"How do I come out to my parents?"
It's been pretty amazing.
That's fabulous. That's wonderful.
So, Pearl, what would you do
with $100,000?
Maybe buy some nice wigs after seeing
myself in thirsty-ass wigs all season.
Now, one final question:
do I have something on my face?
The answer is yes.
And it's a mixture of pride,
affection, and about
two and a half inches of foundation.
Ladies and gentlemen,
give it up for Pearl.
Welcome back to the grand finale
of <i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i>.
It's time for one last tango
with a queen who's always in vogue.
Please welcome Violet Chachki.
[cheers and applause]
[RuPaul] Come through, mama!
Okay, Violet, let's talk to the judges,
starting with... I hate Michelle Visage.
You can hate me all you want.
I loves me some Violet Chachki.
What's so impressive about you
is you have beautiful clothes,
but you wear the clothes,
they don't wear you.
You really present yourself.
Thank you.
Every week,
I've been on the edge of my seat
waiting for you to electrify me
with your looks.
And tonight, though, you electrified me
with your performance, honey.
-[Ross] You earned it.
-Thank you.
Thank you, judges.
Now, Violet Chachki, since day one,
you wowed us with your runway,
but this competition
has not always been a cinch for you.
Let's take a look.
{\an8}I'm a one-of-a-kind collectible.
{\an8}Party.
{\an8}<i>My biggest strength is aesthetics.</i>
<i>I'm very visually appealing.</i>
Is that conceited?
[RuPaul] <i>You took fashion risks,</i>
<i>and they paid off.</i>
[Violet] <i>I'm giving you tartan eleganza.</i>
<i>I'm giving you 1956 Dior.</i>
<i>I'm giving you John Willie</i>
<i>vintage smut for your nerves.</i>
You might have been playing
a dead person, but we were living.
Violet does have a tendency
to be sort of bitchy.
You are the team leader.
Whatever you want, boo-boo.
They think I'm mean, but all I've done
either comes from a place of humor
or a place of truth.
The biggest thing
that I've learned in this process
<i>is to just be aware</i>
<i>of your first impressions.</i>
<i>I represent the past, the present,</i>
<i>but more than anything, the future.</i>
So when did you start
designing your own clothes?
I think I started sewing
around, like, eighth grade.
Skinny jeans were just becoming a thing,
and they didn't have them
in boys' clothes.
And I also tailored
my Catholic school uniform.
-You went to Catholic school?
-K through 12.
I would do alterations mostly, so I think
at 12 or 13, I got a sewing machine.
Where'd all this confidence come from?
I got to a point in my life where I was
sick of dealing with other people's...
What they wanted me to do.
I said, "You know what? I'm gonna
live my life for me, and that's it."
We have some fan questions.
Are you ready?
-Yeah, let's do it.
-All right, there is Gia Gunn.
{\an8}[Violet] Hi, Gia Gunn.
From Skylar from California:
"Violet, what would you tell a teenager
who wants to do drag
but is afraid of how their family
and friends will react?"
What I did is, I would do drag
in the middle of the night in my bedroom.
Eventually, I went out, snuck around,
just do it in secret until it became okay
and I became comfortable to do it
and be proud of it.
-Oh, that's good advice.
-Absolutely. I think that's wonderful.
Thank you, Gia.
Do we have another question?
-Hi.
-Hi, Mimi.
{\an8}Okay, Violet Chachki,
{\an8}you were voted
the shadiest queen by the other girls.
Chris from San Diego wants to know:
"Who did you vote for and why?"
I think I voted for myself, actually.
I'm honest.
If you can't hate yourself, how the hell
are you going to hate somebody else?
There you have it. It's time to hear
from some of your biggest supporters.
-Let's take a look.
-I'm Team Violet because she is sickening.
Team Violet for the win!
Yes, bitch! Fuck it up!
Slay! Come through!
<i>Hi, Violet, mom here.</i>
I just wanted to say congratulations
for making it to the finals.
I am so proud
of the way you have handled yourself.
We wanted to let you know
how proud we are.
We never doubted
you'd make it to the finals.
Now the world knows it too.
We're proud to be your friends.
-Now make them bitches eat it.
-We love you.
Hi, Violet, your dad here. I would like
to wish you all the success in the world.
I am proud of the level of accomplishment
you've achieved doing what you love to do.
I hope to see you go all the way
to the top. Good luck. We love you.
{\an8}Your mother, Alex, is here.
{\an8}What advice do you have for parents
with children as flamboyant as Violet?
As a parent, you have to let them
be their own person.
-That's all you can do.
-[RuPaul] Right.
That's good advice. Thanks, Alex.
Now, Violet, what would it mean to you
to become America's next drag superstar?
It would mean everything.
This is it. This is what I love to do.
I have such a passion for it.
It gives me life. It's everything to me.
It brings me so much happiness and joy.
In whatever mood I'm in,
I can watch a bitch like Kennedy twirl
and just get so happy watching it.
It moves me. I love it so much.
And it would mean the world to me.
Well, Violet Chachki, you are not
just a one-of-a-kind collectible.
You are a treasure.
Ladies and gentlemen, Violet Chachki.
Welcome back to the grand finale
of <i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i>.
Now, while the top three
are backstage getting ready,
it's time to catch up with the queens
that made this season sickening.
Starting with a drag dad, a code cracker,
a corn popper, and a very married lady.
{\an8}Mama's home. Ah!
{\an8}[laughter]
{\an8}My drag style is influenced
by campy and kitschy people of the world.
[Kandy] So how old are you?
-Oh! How old am I? Really?
-How old?
{\an8}I'm Sasha Belle.
Say hello to my little friends!
{\an8}<i>I can tell you every episode,</i>
<i>what the challenge was, who went home.</i>
I've cracked the code.
<i>We'll never pick up</i>
<i>hot men looking like this.</i>
<i>I'm the next drag superstar</i>
<i>because I've done my homework.</i>
{\an8}-We made it, bitches!
-Yes!
{\an8}<i>Jasmine is class and elegance.</i>
{\an8}I am here. H-E-R-E, bitch. I'm here.
Where did you get a loaf of bread?
[Jasmine] <i>No tea, no shade,</i>
<i>no pink lemonade.</i>
Ding!
{\an8}Hi, my honeys. I'm home.
{\an8}My name is Mrs. Kasha Davis.
-[RuPaul] Is that Joan Rivers?
-What are you wearing?
[Kasha] <i>Anybody can be a girl,</i>
<i>but it takes balls to be a lady.</i>
There's always time for a cocktail.
Tempest DuJour, Kandy Ho accused you
of being too old. How did you feel?
Well, it never feels good,
but Kandy and I are friends.
I wish that, you know, at my age,
she looks half as fabulous as I do.
I'm sorry for calling you old.
-Apology accepted.
-My mom taught me better.
To be nice to old people.
-I love you, girl. I love you so much.
-I love you, too, I really do.
You also have an eight-year-old
and a five-year-old at home.
-Correct.
-Did they watch?
They did.
My daughter watched the first episode.
She cried when I got eliminated.
She said, "Papa, why doesn't
RuPaul like you anymore?"
Mimi, if you're watching,
RuPaul loves your daddy. Now, go to bed!
Next up, we've got Sasha Belle.
You arrived thinking that you had cracked
the code. What happened?
I thought that I did crack the code.
I thought I knew what you wanted,
but I think what makes the show so great
is that it's so different every season.
-And I wasn't ready.
-All right.
Now, back in Iowa, you host a night
called "Sasha Belle's Drag Race,"
-is that right?
-Yes, yes.
First of all, you'll be hearing
from my lawyers.
And, second of all, how is that going?
It's going really good. We do it
because I really fucking love this show.
I do.
If there was no grand prize,
I would still play.
You keep ringing them bells.
All right. Thank you.
-Up next, Jasmine Masters.
-Oh, my God.
What was your most exciting moment
on the drag race?
-Meeting Kennedy.
-Really?
Yeah. Because I have watched her
at least nine years, ten years
on VCR tapes doing pageants
and dancing and stuff.
And... I'm sorry if I snitch
on your age, girl. Forgive me, girl.
-Jasmine, who inspired you to do drag?
-Patti LaBelle.
She who she is when she on stage,
when she off stage. She gives 1,000%.
-I just love her. She's everything to me.
-Well, we have a surprise for you.
-Take a look.
-What?
Hi, Jasmine.
I love the way you stirred it up, honey.
Thank you for always looking
like Patti LaBelle at my concerts.
I love you. Bye.
Are you serious, Ru?
You did that for me?
[RuPaul] Yeah.
Yes. Yep.
Well, I felt like we needed
to lift you up even more,
because on social media,
people were very harsh to you.
-How did that make you feel?
-When you...
...are getting so much negativity,
it's like you can't breathe.
And it took me back to a friend of mine
who had committed suicide
when they were bullied so much
being young and gay.
Their parents put them out.
The straight and the gay world
didn't accept them,
so they just ended it 'cause they didn't
feel like they belong. That's how I felt.
-Well...
-So it was hard,
but I just ate a lot of food
and a lot of hot sauce, and...
[RuPaul] I'm glad you did get through it,
and I'm glad you're here.
For seven years, our show has been one
of the most popular ones on social media.
But recently, there's been a shift
with more and more comments
having a darker tone.
But like my mama always said,
"Unless them bitches is paying your bills,
you pay them bitches no mind."
All right, next up, there's always time
for a cocktail and Mrs. Kasha Davis.
During the competition, you had
some issues with some of the younger kids.
What were they?
Some of the young gals on the show
just had sort of a sense of entitlement.
It gets a little grating in that respect,
where somebody, you know,
"I've been doing this
for seven months. I will win."
And they might. So, um...
But I learned a lot from these girls.
Trixie taught me how to put
way too much makeup on.
And I'm wearing
two of Violet's corsets right here.
I've always wanted to ask you,
is there really a Mr. Kasha Davis?
-There is.
-[RuPaul] Where is he?
{\an8}-Right here in the...
-[RuPaul] That's him?
{\an8}-[Kasha] That's Mr. Davis.
-[RuPaul] Hi, Mr. Kasha Davis.
-He's cute.
-He's cute.
Get ready, Mr. Davis,
'cause mama's coming home.
Welcome back to the grand finale
of <i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i>.
As our top three prepare backstage
for the crowning of our next superstar,
these four queens are the perfect balance
of sugar, spice, and everything nice.
Oh, and, um, chickens too. Take a look.
{\an8}I hope you girls got a sweet tooth,
because Kandy's in the fucking house.
{\an8}<i>Kandy is hot. Kandy is </i>candente<i>.</i>
<i>If you touch her too close,</i>
you might get burned.
I think this runway is right on my alley.
{\an8}Well, it's about time.
{\an8}<i>I do drag because I have the yearning</i>
<i>for old Hollywood glamour.</i>
{\an8}<i>I'm a starlet on the rise.</i>
There's a man on the wing!
-Tramp!
-You're the Meryl Streep of drag.
[Max] <i>It's all so surreal.</i>
{\an8}My name is Jaidynn Diore Fierce.
How y'all doing?
{\an8}<i>Because I am what? Fierce.</i>
Work that puss.
I have not officially come out
to my family yet.
I think it may change my relationship,
and that's what I'm scared of most.
{\an8}[Miss Fame] <i>My brand is runway shows,</i>
<i>magazines, beyond-this-planet beautiful. </i>
Should I not talk about my feelings,
or should I just keep moving on?
My God. I feel like I'm dating you.
How's your head?
How is your head?
How's your head?
Fine.
[clucking]
That's how I talk to chickens.
Kandy Ho, I hear that you are thinking
about leaving Puerto Rico?
-I am.
-<i>Escándalo</i>!
<i>Ay, sí.</i>
I love Puerto Rico,
and I've been there since I was ten,
-but...
-Where were you before?
Connecticut.
[Max] You're a liar!
-I guess I'm a fake Puerto Rican, right?
-Okay, all right.
-What would you have done differently?
-I wouldn't have painted on a beard.
I looked like a Neapolitan ice cream.
-Do you do your own makeup?
-I started doing it
a month before auditioning for the show.
In Puerto Rico, we just go up
to our fabulous makeup artists, like,
"Paint me and do my hair
and dress me up, and I'm gone."
-Yeah.
-It's, like, my mistake. Sorry.
Yeah. Kandy, my dear,
you are one of my favorite hos, and...
That's saying a lot,
because I know a lot of hos.
Next, the silver fox of season seven, Max.
Yes. Now, this season,
when the queens were talking about sex,
you weren't having it at all.
You were like...
Listen, these girls, they don't talk
about anything else besides sex.
But I was tired of it. Just for a moment.
-Okay.
-I'm not...
I'm not that big of a prude,
honest to goodness.
You coached Jaidynn and Pearl
through a few tense moments.
Tell us about that.
Well, Jaidynn is an actress.
She is a performer.
For her to say, "I'm not," that was
nerves, so we had to calm down.
Pearl had to calm down, we had to regroup,
and then we had to go kill it.
-Yeah.
-I love it. That's great.
That's great advice.
Well, Max, when it comes to my feelings
for you, there are no gray areas.
Thank you.
Up next, Jaidynn Diore Fierce.
What surprised you the most
about being on the show?
Um, well, I didn't think
we were gonna be locked up so much.
-Child.
-You're sequestered.
And that was... I was imagining myself
going out to dinner with you, darling.
-Yeah.
-I thought we'd go to Hollywood Boulevard.
Get some munchies,
some cauliflower, corn bread,
green beans, a turkey.
And I wasn't able to do that.
I was sitting in my hotel room,
-beating myself up and eating Doritos.
-That's different from your normal life?
You revealed that your mother
and your brother knew that you did drag.
-Yes.
-But they didn't know that you're gay.
-Right.
-And now?
-Where is that right now?
-Well, I think it was...
she didn't want me to be that way.
I don't think they understand,
-you know, fully, who a gay person is.
-Well, that's funny,
because we have a little surprise for you.
Take a look at this.
Surprise, surprise!
I didn't get a chance to talk to you.
You had some concerns.
I've experienced rejection in my life,
so it's very hard for me to reject mine,
because I know how hurtful
and painful rejection is.
<i>You know, this is not a battle,</i>
<i>it's just...</i>
one thing that we're just gonna learn
to just go ahead and do what we do,
and that's love one another.
My love is not based on what you do.
My love is based on who you are.
And you're my precious,
handsome Christopher.
What are you feeling right now?
I feel like my family is now gonna be able
to get to know who I really am,
after 26 years of my life.
If I don't get anything else, I got
the peace and the freedom to be who I am
around my family, and to be happy.
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i>, still bringing
families together. Hallelu.
All right.
Up next, Miss Fame, girl, hey.
Hi.
-By the way, how's your head?
-Well, there have been a few complaints.
[Miss Fame] What?
You and Katya came clean
-about being sober.
-Right.
-And what's the reaction been?
-You know what,
I've had so many people write me
personal stories about how much time
they had, how inspiring it was.
It's just a dream come true
to be able to walk through
the obstacle of addiction
and be able to...
live your life.
Miss Fame, all season long, you served
fierce couture, gorgeous fashions,
and people only want
to talk to you about chickens.
I'm not mad about it.
At least they're talking to me.
[RuPaul] Yeah.
I grew up on a farm
with the chickens, so...
Can you talk a little chicken?
-Can you do that?
-I can, but I think it's best I have...
a special guest come out
to help me do that.
-Is Colonel Sanders here?
-Hold on one moment.
Colonel Sanders? I thought he was dead.
-Oh, my God, you fucking bitch!
-Gorgeous!
She's got bigger hair than me tonight.
-Do you do tricks with it?
-I'm afraid of it shitting on my couture.
Oh, dear.
Miss Fame, whether in fashion or poultry,
you have a bright future ahead of you.
-Just don't cluck it up, okay?
-I promise I won't!
[RuPaul] Okay.
Welcome back to the grand finale
of <i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i>.
We are moments away from finding out
if Ginger, Pearl or Violet Chachki
will be crowned
America's next drag superstar.
But first, some fierce contenders
that gave our top three a real run
for their money. Let's take a look.
{\an8}This isn't Maury Povich.
{\an8}<i>Drag queens say,</i>
<i>"Paint for the back row."</i>
I paint for the check-cashing place
down the street.
If you're gonna be the comedy queen,
you gotta go all the way.
You right, girl, you right.
<i>I'm back. Good evening,</i>
<i>distinguished panel of judges.</i>
Sashay away.
All right, public school. Calm down.
{\an8}[speaking Russian]
{\an8}<i>I'm just your average, run-of-the-mill,</i>
<i>Russian bisexual transvestite hooker.</i>
I'm not going anywhere.
Ru and I are great friends.
-Miss Fame did our makeup.
-[Michelle] Ah!
{\an8}When do I get to blow them?
{\an8}-I can't say that either?
-[laughter]
{\an8}Well, hello.
{\an8}<i>I'm Kennedy Davenport. I spin, I flip,</i>
<i>I jump off the stage in six-inch heels.</i>
-Kennedy, did you rehearse your team?
-That was a rough spot.
Next. Whoo!
-[Ross] Kennedy...
-[Ross and Kathy singing] Davenport!
Shut up!
[RuPaul] <i>Newark, LaGuardia,</i>
<i>Kennedy Davenport.</i>
Ain't nobody got time for that.
-So, Trixie Mattel.
-Hi, Ru.
When you first left, the internet
went cray cray. What was that like?
I felt very supported and loved.
I felt like less of a loser.
-Well, losing is the new winning.
-Yes!
What's your life been like
since <i>Drag Race</i>?
Oh, my gosh.
If I never get a chance again,
I have to thank you, because...
you reached into my little blond,
pink life and changed it so much.
[cheers and applause]
I'm glad you got to experience this.
Now, I hear you do
a mean RuPaul impersonation.
I could never.
-Let me hear it.
-Okay.
-Yeah.
-Trixie, on the runway you're a doll,
but your comedy seems manufactured.
-Are you mad?
-Sashay away.
Three times! Three times!
Next up, Katya!
Katya, all season long, you were
plagued with doubt. What was going on?
-I was terrified the whole fucking time.
-Really?
RuPaul, you are sitting there, I see you,
-but I want to tackle you to the ground.
-Uh-huh. Yeah?
I want to stuff your entire wig
inside my mouth...
[RuPaul] Okay, yeah.
-And I want you to pee on me.
-Okay.
-Yeah.
-And listen.
The first time you came over
to me, I was, like,
waiting my whole life for this.
-Sure.
-And... I don't know.
There's something in my brain
that said, "She wants to kill you."
And I... I know you don't want to...
I mean, I'm 98% sure at least.
Oh, no, I did want to kill you.
And then I just couldn't...
I don't know.
But now, having seen the show,
do you see that it's unfounded,
that you have no reason to doubt yourself?
Do you you were fabulous?
Watching the show has given me...
some self-esteem.
So thank you so much, Ru.
Katya, you are a freak. And...
-I freaking love you.
-Oh, my God.
[cheers and laughter]
All right, up next,
LaGuardia, Newark, Kennedy.
Now, Kennedy, when I started
saying that, I had no idea
that you would actually
fly off the main stage.
-Have you ever hurt between me down there?
-No, I mean, I'm a trained dancer.
-You mean "dahn-cer."
-"Dahn-sah."
[RuPaul] Yes.
So I did the necessary things to stretch,
to make sure that did not happen.
But there's more down there
that could get hurt.
Yeah, way more than Katya.
-It's true.
-Yeah.
[RuPaul] Yeah.
Throughout the season,
we joked about "the struggle is real."
It became one of your tag lines,
but in your family, in your background,
that's a reality.
I know that you recently reunited
with your mother after a long separation.
My mother's been in and out.
My dad got custody when I was two,
and my sister was two months.
And she would make me mad
because she said she'd come,
and she never did, and she was in and out.
-She was on her own journey.
-But she's here tonight with you,
-right?
-Yeah.
{\an8}[RuPaul] Chicory, are you there?
Is that Chicky right there? I love it.
{\an8}-Hey, Mama Chicory.
-Hi.
I am so glad you are here with us tonight.
Give her a big round of applause.
And on another note,
if you ever have the chance to get out
and see Miss Kennedy Davenport in concert,
live, it will give you life. Trust. Yes.
-Yes, it's true.
-Thank you.
{\an8}Now it's time
for viewer questions. Who's first?
{\an8}-Hi! I have a question for Trixie...
-[RuPaul] Uh-huh.
{\an8}-From Sarah.
-Yeah.
"You and Max knew each other in college.
Did Max speak
with that fake-ass British accent then?"
[crowd hooting and cheering]
I don't think so, but I've never been
to that area of Wisconsin.
-Maybe they talk that way.
-Yeah, that's true.
It's just an elocution thing, a diction
and an elocution thing, not an accent.
-What'd she say?
-She says it's elocution, not an accent.
-"Alacutia"?
-Uh-huh.
[RuPaul] Yeah.
-Is she from Inglewood?
-[RuPaul] Yes.
-I know her. I know her.
-I went to high school with her.
Yeah.
{\an8}-Well, Delta Work, you better work.
-I have a question from Amy in Boston.
"If there's an <i>All-Stars Two</i>, which queen
from season seven deserves to compete?"
Kennedy, who would you condone?
Nominate. Who would you nominate?
To be honest and to answer the question,
I really would choose Katya.
So you guys know something
about <i>All-Stars Two</i> that I don't.
Well, thank you, ladies.
Now it's time to announce the winner
of this year's Miss Congeniality.
Give it up for last year's winner,
Ben DeLaCreme.
Well, Ru, we're here to announce
this year's breast in... Best in Show.
Sorry. Actually, it's the award
for season seven's Miss Congeniality.
I dropped the envelope out of my bosoms.
Michelle, would you join me?
Great, thank you.
Thank you so much.
The winner of season seven's
Miss Congeniality
and a cash prize of $5,000,
courtesy of Logo.... I know, right? Is...
Katya!
Condragulations.
Is there anything you'd like to say?
[speaking Russian]
Now, thanks to all of you for voting,
ladies and gentlemen. Walk the runway.
[electronic music playing]
Welcome back to the grand finale
of <i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i>.
Are y'all ready to crown
America's next drag superstar?
Good. Please help me welcome back
to the stage your top three queens.
Ginger Minj!
[RuPaul] Pearl!
[RuPaul] Violet Chachki!
Looking good, ladies.
There are only six people on Earth
who know what it feels like to be crowned
America's next drag superstar.
Please help me welcome
your reigning queen, Bianca Del Rio!
[RuPaul] Wow.
Wow!
[RuPaul laughs]
Bianca Del Rio, my queen. How are you?
I'm good. I'm like the Tin Man.
I don't have a heart. But I'm good!
I want to know, what has
this past year been like for you?
It's been absolutely unreal.
I've had this amazing journey.
I've been able to travel the world,
spread my hate, do my thing, I...
No, truly, I've been in Australia,
London, Amsterdam, Akron, Ohio.
Places I never expected to visit.
It's been unreal and amazing.
I have to say that the opportunity
this lady has given me changed my life.
Therefore, I cannot thank you enough.
It's been amazing.
-So respect it.
-Thank you, Bianca.
In addition to the title
of America's next drag superstar,
the winner will walk away with a crown
and scepter provided
by Fierce! Drag Jewels
and a sickening supply of makeup
from Anastasia Beverly Hills
-and a cash prize of $100,000.
-[cheers and applause]
Now,
the time has come to crown our queen.
As always, I've consulted
with the judges and the fans,
but the final decision is mine to make.
Ginger Minj.
[cheers and applause]
Pearl.
[cheers and applause]
Violet Chachki.
[cheers and applause]
The winner of <i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i>
and America's next drag superstar is...
[coughs]
Katya?
Would you please step forward?
Katya.
May I please have a sip of water?
[laughter]
[cheers and applause]
-Yes!
-You fucking bitch.
Where were we? Oh, of course.
The time has come to crown our queen.
The winner...
of <i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i>...
and America's next drag superstar...
is...
Violet Chachki.
[cheering]
Congratulations.
Thank you.
Is there anything you'd like to say?
Come through!
Now, prance, my queen. Prance.
Condragulations. Wonderful.
Remember, if you can't love yourself,
how in the hell are you going
to love somebody else?
Can I get an amen in here?
{\an8}-[all] Amen.
-[RuPaul] All right.
{\an8}Good night, everybody.
{\an8}I love you!


{\an8}[RuPaul laughs]
{\an8}[music playing]
{\an8}Greetings, earth queens.
I come in peace.
{\an8}I'm Miss Fame, I'm 29 years old,
and I'm beyond-this-planet beautiful.
Well, it looks like I'm the only one here.
Thank God.
My brand is classic,
chic fashion model.
I think I might choose a center spot.
Center stage, it feels appropriate.
I'm ready to show everybody
what I'm meant to do,
<i>which is leave a beauty mark</i>
<i>on the face of the planet.</i>
Hi, fellas.
{\an8}My name is Ginger Minj,
and I am a overweight, asthmatic,
{\an8}chain-smoking cross-dresser
from Orlando, Florida.
I like to describe myself
as a glamour toad.
-You look gorgeous.
-Something subtle for groceries?
Just a little something
to pick up some apples.
I know that I will never be
the prettiest one,
but I will always be the beautiful one.
How are y'all doing?
<i>My name is Jaidynn Diore Fierce,</i>
{\an8}capital F-I-E-R-C-E,
because I am what? Fierce.
Hi, gorgeous.
-How you doing? Come on, Miss Sickening.
-Okay, girl.
And is there another big girl?
I can only be the only big girl.
She's gonna serve you body. She's gonna
serve you everything you need to survive.
I'm always gonna give you life.
[laughs]
[Jaidynn] Uh-oh... Who is it?
Oh, la, la, la, la, la, la.
{\an8}I'm Violet Chachki, I'm 22 years old,
and I am a one-of-a-kind collectible.
-Hey, gang.
-Come on, shoes.
How are you doing?
[Violet] <i>My biggest strength</i>
<i>is probably aesthetics.</i>
I'm very visually appealing.
Is that conceited?
-Miss Fame.
-Violet Chachki.
Violet Chachki,
you can't forget that. [laughs]
I've seen Miss Fame's work before, and I'm
pretty impressed, but not that impressed.
[Violet] Tall fish.
{\an8}Well, it's about time.
{\an8}My name is Max,
and I'm a starlet on the rise.
-And you're Max?
-Yes, I'm Max.
-Period? Just Max?
-Max, period or capitalized,
or any way you want
to say it or spell it.
Cool.
I do drag because I have the yearning
for old Hollywood glamour.
-Where are you from, Max?
-I'm from Wisconsin, actually.
[Violet] Wisconsin.
Well, yes, this is a contest for queens,
but not the Queen of England, girl.
-Can I look at your paper?
-Of course.
[Miss Fame]
Let me teach you a beauty trick.
[Miss Fame] Blot away that shine.
I don't know if that came across shady,
but thank you, Max.
C'mon season seven!
-[Miss Fame] Is this Russia?
-[Katya] With love.
{\an8}My name is Ekatarina Petrovna Zamochkova,
but you can call me Katya.
[Jaidynn] Come on, accent.
{\an8}I'm just your average, run-of-the-mill,
Russian, bisexual transvestite hooker.
Is this the Shulman Bar Mitzvah?
[speaking Russian]
Katya is at the intersection
of glamour and comedy.
You can find her right on the corner,
selling her ass.
-Is this Soviet Union inspired?
-It's my great-grandma's army uniform.
[laughter]
-I'm here! We made it, bitches!
-[all] Yes!
{\an8}I'm Jasmine Masters,
and I'm 37 years old. Ding!
-How did you get this body?
-Girl, I don't know.
Jasmine is class and elegance.
Jasmine is... [snapping fingers]
...it.
-Where are you from?
-Nashville.
-Nashville, I'll be there. And you?
-Atlanta.
All right, Atlanta. Hotlanta, girl.
No one says that, but yes.
Okay, work.
Hi, my honeys, I'm home! [laughs]
Are there any other queens here?
Oh, just me, I guess. [laughs]
{\an8}My name is Mrs. Kasha Davis. [laughs]
I'm an international celebrity housewife,
because of that one time
I performed in Canada.
-Nice to meet you.
-I like your tits.
-Mine are still bigger, though.
-[all] Whoa, whoa!
-Jiggle, jiggle, jiggle.
-I'm jealous.
I don't have any fat to push together.
This isn't Maury Povich.
{\an8}My name is Trixie Mattel,
and I'm 24 years old.
Oh, my goodness!
Well, here's another comedy queen.
She has her overdrawn lips
and clown makeup. She is ready to go.
I'm a hair and makeup artist.
So...
I think a lot of the queens don't
necessarily get where I'm coming from.
Drag queens always say,
"Paint for the back row."
I paint for the check-cashing place
down the street.
I hope you girls have a sweet tooth,
because Kandy is
in the motherfucking house.
[Jaidynn] She's got a tag line.
{\an8}I'm Kandy Ho, and I'm 28 years old.
-From Puerto Rico.
-[all] Puerto Rico!
Kandy is hot.
Kandy is <i>candente</i>.
If you touch her too close,
you might get burned.
[cheering]
-[Jaidynn] Look who walked in, bitch.
-'Sup?
{\an8}I'm Pearl. I'm 23 years old.
I would describe Pearl as some kind
of robotic, Stepford Wife bitch.
-[Pearl] Hey, girls.
-[all] Hi, welcome.
I notice this black trim around her chin,
I'm thinking, "What the hell is that?"
But hey, you like it,
rock your own boat.
Come on, chin strap.
-Well, hello.
-[cheering]
{\an8}I'm Kennedy Davenport,
and I am the dancing diva of Texas, honey.
-Wait, Kennedy!
-Yes.
-Oh, my God!
-That's me.
I spin, I kick, I flip,
I jump off the stage in 6-inch heels.
That's what puts the diva in it.
Get over here.
I wanted to meet you forever, girl!
I'm a big fan of Kennedy Davenport.
I've been wanting to meet her for so long.
Like, Ru turned the party for me.
Oh, my God! [laughs]
For real, y'all,
I'm geeked the fuck up.
I'm geeked! I'm geeked!
Hey, it's me.
Say hello to my little friend!
{\an8}I'm Sasha Belle,
I'm 28 years old,
{\an8}and I have been mentally preparing myself
for this for years.
[Miss Fame] Just anywhere will do.
I could tell you every episode,
what the challenge was, who went home.
I feel like I've cracked the code.
Hey, girls, what's going on?
I'm the next Drag Superstar
because I've done my homework.
Girl, please. No, sorry.
Next.
Who's ready for some hot tuna casserole?
'Cause mama's home.
Ugh!
[laughter]
[Jasmine] No, ma'am.
{\an8}I'm Tempest DuJour,
and I'm 46 years old.
[Miss Fame] A baby!
My drag style
is influenced by Phyllis Diller
and the campy
and kitschy people of the world.
-Your baby is adorable.
-Thank you. It's Amber, Amber Alert.
[Max] Amber Alert.
Tempest, she's an old-fashioned drag.
She tries to be funny, I guess.
-So how old are you?
-[Jaidynn] Oh!
[Tempest] How old am I?
Really?
Who the hell does that?
Who in their first meeting says
"How old are you"?
[Tempest] You don't stop dreaming
at a certain age.
[alarm sounding]
{\an8}[RuPaul] <i>She is all ready to have hers!</i>
<i>Welcome, bitches.</i>
<i>-Your Ru-Ru here.</i>
-[cheering and laughter]
<i>You want to grow up</i>
<i>to be supermodel of the world?</i>
<i>You'd better learn how to sissy that walk,</i>
<i>girl, 'cause you're born naked,</i>
<i>and the rest is... Balenciaga!</i>
{\an8}Oh, my God.
What do you think it means?
Hello, hello, hello!
Fabulous!
Welcome, ladykins.
Now, I hope you're tucked tight
and ready for the ride of your life.
[all] Yes.
Because everything you think
you know about <i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i>
-is about to change.
-[all gasp]
Your first challenge
isn't just a photo shoot.
Oh, hell, no!
It's a fashion week extravaganza.
Presented by DKoye
the product, hair care.
To make
an unforgettable first impression,
you need to dig in your trunks
and model two
of your very best looks,
one from your spring collection
and one from your fall collection.
This is right up my alley, and I can't
wait for everyone to gag on my eleganza.
Your runway will be part
of this week's final evaluation.
Kill it on the catwalk
or end up fashion roadkill.
Your choice.
Dang, this is a lot for the first day.
They got us doing runways.
Hashtag too much.
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.
{\an8}[sighs] Why do fashion shows
always start so late?
{\an8}For today's mini challenge,
we have to showcase
{\an8}our spring and fall looks on the runway,
sponsored by DKoye, the product for hair.
This is not a mini challenge.
This is a maxi mini challenge...
with wings.
Oh, wait a minute, it's starting.
{\an8}[RuPaul] Serving spring glamour,
Ginger Minj.
{\an8}[Ginger] <i>I'm doing runway for Michelle</i>
<i>Visage, RuPaul and Carson Kressley.</i>
I think I can see her tool.
[laughter]
[Ginger] <i>I know I can excel</i>
<i>at anything I put my mind to.</i>
{\an8}[RuPaul] Kandy Ho.
Milan, Paris, New York...
{\an8}Pacoima.
{\an8}[Kandy] <i>I'll give you face, I'll give</i>
<i>you ass, I'll give you legs.</i>
This Latina,
she's coming for all of you.
{\an8}[RuPaul] <i>Max.</i>
{\an8}[Carson] Yes, darling. Sell the garment.
I'm making sure that I'm delivering,
and I get to fully portray the character.
[Alaska] I've had pelvic exams
more thrilling than this.
{\an8}[RuPaul] Jaidynn Diore Fierce.
[Carson] It's very Apollonia.
Apollonia six and seven.
-[RuPaul and Carson] And eight and nine.
-[Michelle] All the girls.
{\an8}-[RuPaul] Katya.
-[Carson] Oh...
-[Carson] I do love a onesie for spring.
-[RuPaul] Yes.
-Excellent use of the cape.
-[RuPaul] Yes.
How dull.
{\an8}[RuPaul] Mrs. Kasha Davis.
[RuPaul] I love you,
but give me Park Avenue.
[Michelle laughs] Yes.
<i>Mrs. Kasha Davis is a lady.</i>
Anybody can be a girl,
but it takes a lot of balls to be a lady.
{\an8}[RuPaul] Mitzi Gaynor.
Trixie Mattel.
{\an8}[Michelle] We finally know
what happened to Baby Jane.
My family's Native American.
We grew up very, very poor.
<i>But Trixie, she has it all.</i>
The biggest problem in her life is
what to wear the next day.
{\an8}[RuPaul] Next up, Pearl.
-[RuPaul] Fur for spring.
-[Carson] Yes.
[RuPaul] Blame it on climate change.
Bitch, I'm from New York,
and you can wear fur in spring, okay?
{\an8}[RuPaul] Tempest DuJour.
{\an8}[Michelle] Who is under that skirt?
[RuPaul] My first guess
would be Jimmy Hoffa.
[Michelle]
Oh, Geraldo should have gone there.
{\an8}[RuPaul] Miss Fame!
[Carson] I would read her,
but she's red all over.
My strongest suit is modeling. Ideally,
that will carry me to get that crown.
-I see a red bottom, and it's not a shoe.
-Oh!
{\an8}[Miss Fame] <i>I'm giving you</i>
<i>just a gag-worthy moment. </i>
{\an8}[RuPaul] Jasmine Masters.
[RuPaul] No jacket required.
[Jasmine] <i>Jasmine Master is</i>
<i>bright as summer. I am here.</i>
H-E-R-E, bitch, I'm here.
{\an8}[Carson] Simple midriff.
It's tasteful.
{\an8}[RuPaul] Violet Chachki.
[Michelle] Oh, dear, she has a toothache.
-[Carson] I can see her spleen.
-[RuPaul] Spleens are very in this year.
-[Carson] Spleens are the new orange.
-[RuPaul] Yes.
{\an8}[RuPaul] Kennedy Davenport.
Niecy Nash.
I'm old school and
a touch of new school.
[Kennedy] Everything is bigger in Texas,
and I fit right on in.
[Michelle] She needs a casserole.
[RuPaul] But not tuna.
{\an8}[RuPaul] Sasha Belle.
{\an8}<i>I see those judges,</i>
<i>give 'em a little look.</i>
{\an8}I need to show them
how much I want this.
[Carson] She already has a fan.
[Alaska] Who uses fans anymore?
Now it's time to do our fall look.
Child, the struggle is real.
{\an8}[RuPaul] Let's see what they're
serving for fall. Ginger Minj.
{\an8}Ginger Minj is a plus-size diva.
{\an8}She always wants to look
neat, petite, and ready to eat.
-[RuPaul] She's like a magazine editor.
-[Carson] Yeah, popular wildlife.
{\an8}It's so hideous,
I think I'll put it on the cover.
{\an8}[RuPaul] Kandy Ho.
Fur again.
[Carson] More fur.
It's shaved beaver, I believe.
[Michelle laughs]
{\an8}[RuPaul] Max.
{\an8}[Carson]
I'm having Jil Sander flashbacks.
-Yes, right?
-And I like it.
-[RuPaul] Very Tilda Swinton.
-[Carson] Very.
{\an8}[RuPaul] Jaidynn Diore Fierce.
I see Chaka Khan.
[Carson] She's every woman.
This is definitely a signature
Jaidynn Diore Fierce look.
[Jaidynn] I'm the other,
other, other Tyra.
{\an8}-[RuPaul] Katya.
-[Carson] Fur's back.
[RuPaul] Yes, fur is back.
[Katya] I'm giving you dead animal
camouflage, Duck Dynasty realness.
Pamela Anderson, I'm so sorry.
[RuPaul] Oh, my God, she killed it.
I mean, she really killed it.
[Michelle] Literally.
{\an8}[RuPaul] Mrs. Kasha Davis.
-[RuPaul] Look at those curves.
-[Michelle] These are not for sale.
[Carson] I'm thinking Colombian
mother of the bride.
[Michelle chuckles]
{\an8}[RuPaul] Trixie Mattel.
{\an8}-[Carson] The handbag matches.
-[Michelle] Is that a sequins dress?
-[RuPaul] That is a sequins dress.
-[Michelle] Yes.
[Michelle] It's like two pigs
fighting under a blanket back there.
{\an8}[RuPaul] Next up, Pearl.
You can't lose with black, you know?
[Michelle] She's a lady DJ.
[Michelle] Eat your heart out,
Paris Hilton.
I'm sure she's listening
to <i>Born Naked</i>, my new album.
-Of course.
-Can you hear us right now?
[Carson] Hello? Nothing.
{\an8}[RuPaul] Tempest DuJour.
[Tempest] <i>The look I've chosen</i>
<i>is intended to show</i>
that I can have more than one kind
of campy, kitschy look.
-[Carson] I like the quilted poncho.
-[Michelle] It's a car cover.
[RuPaul laughs]
Please make it stop.
{\an8}[RuPaul] Miss Fame. Wow.
-[RuPaul] Golden lady.
-[Carson] It's not lame, it's <i>lamé</i>.
[Michelle chuckles]
[Carson] I do like the fascinator.
-I'm fascinated by fascinators.
-Me too, I could talk about them for days.
{\an8}[RuPaul] Jasmine Masters. Wow.
[RuPaul] Purple Rain.
[Jasmine] <i>Jasmine is</i>
<i>in a purple trench coat with black fur.</i>
Well, not really fur.
Just some old carpet I straightened out.
[Jasmine laughs]
{\an8}[RuPaul] Violet Chachki.
[Carlson] Looking smart in tartan.
[Michelle] Getting a reveal.
[all] Oh!
[RuPaul] Bay City Roller.
I'm giving you tartan eleganza. Being able
to serve two looks in one is a talent.
It's okay.
{\an8}[RuPaul] Kennedy Davenport.
Yes, she's going back to her roots.
-[Michelle] All that green.
-[RuPaul] She's a sexy choir master.
[Carson] Yes.
[Michelle] Exactly what I was thinking.
{\an8}[RuPaul] Sasha Belle.
Oh, my word!
{\an8}-[Carson] Fan's back. Wow.
-[Michelle laughs]
-[Carson] What's going on in front?
-[Michelle] The underbelly of a lobster.
-[RuPaul] I want one in every color.
-[Carson] Now we know what to wear.
-[Michelle, RuPaul] Yeah.
-I'll be wearing lobster.
Yeah. I go for my first
shell fitting next week.
[Carson] Oh, God!
Hi, everybody.
It's so nice to finally meet all of you.
Everybody's taking off their drag, and I'm
like, "Who the fuck are these people?"
Trixie... Did somebody from the crew
just wander into the workroom?
Pearl? Trade.
Ginger's transformation is remarkable.
She goes from Kathy Bates to Bob Hoskins.
-Hello, hello, hello, ladies!
-[all] Hi!
Well, well, well. This is the most
draggedy season premiere ever!
And we're just getting started. Pit crew!
[cheering, applause]
-[applause]
-Oh, my goodness!
Oh, my goodness!
I think the new pit crew member
may be Jewish.
[cheering]
<i>Mazel tov</i>.
All right, ladies,
the pit crew arrived in the buff
because for the first time
in Drag Race her-story,
you'll be making your
main stage debut...
naked...
-...and afraid.
-[hooting]
[screams]
You need to create a resort-wear look
that tears away to reveal
{\an8}a nude illusion.
Because you were what?
{\an8}Hashtag, born naked and the rest is drag.
No tea, no shade, no pink lemonade,
but looking at some of these queens,
I'm thinking, "Ru, you don't want to see
these girls naked. I know you don't."
{\an8}The Maxi Challenge this week is
to create resort wear that has a tear-away
{\an8}to reveal a nude illusion.
I pride myself on utilizing literally
none of my natural features,
so a challenge where I compete
with these beautiful fishy girls
with perfect bodies
is a worst-case situation.
{\an8}I'm just hoping
this looks expensive.
{\an8}My brand that is Miss Fame is
runway shows, fashion magazines, glamour.
So I love this challenge.
I really want to win badly.
That looks resort-y.
Does anybody have scissors?
Be a good Christian and let me use them.
-Hey, cutie girl.
-[all] Hi.
-How are my nudie-patootie?
-[Jasmine] Nude.
-Well, Tempest DuJour.
-RuPaul.
I'm excited to see what you come up with.
I know you're a costume designer.
I am. I teach it,
so I feel a little pressure
from my students who'll be watching this.
When you auditioned a few years ago,
you were still heavy.
-Yeah. I was just under 400 pounds.
-Ex-squeeze me?
<i>I'm trying to lead by example.</i>
<i>That was the catalyst for the weight loss.</i>
Part of it was,
I gotta be alive for these kids.
{\an8}I've been with my husband now
for eight years,
{\an8}<i>and I have two amazing</i>
<i>and beautiful adopted children.</i>
I'm at a place in my life now where
my children are more important to me
than that bucket of fried chicken.
I'll let you get back to work.
I want to see what you come up with.
-Thanks, Ru. Bye.
-Thanks.
-Kandy Ho.
-Hey, mamas.
From the Ho family of products.
Tell me about your nude illusion.
Traditionally on our show,
Puerto Ricans like to show a lot of body.
I love to show body.
I think this runway is right on my alley.
-It's on your alley? [laughs]
-Yes.
-Okay. Do you know how to sew?
-I don't.
How do you become a drag queen
without knowing how to sew?
I think it takes more than sewing,
because you can know how to sew,
but you can have
the worst taste ever.
Any sensible queen should know
how to make a dress.
You know, it's part of the game
you have to play.
Oh, bitch!
-Why, Jasmine Masters!
-Yes, mother Ru?
What are you planning
for the reveal on the main stage?
It's like a butterfly in a cocoon.
-I've heard of those, yes.
-I'm going to be
some type of a cocoon that grows.
So, as I'm walking down the runway,
I'm gonna grow.
The butterfly is actually in the cocoon.
This is the cocoon.
-Right...
-Which is me, the butterfly.
-You know, like a butterfly in a cocoon?
-Uh-huh.
Every step that I take down the runway,
the butterfly inside is growing.
Oh, yeah.
So once I get to the end of the runway,
the butterfly is there.
Okay, great. Great.
Well, keep working. All right.
{\an8}Jasmine's resort tear-away
is two hula hoops with fabric around it.
Who the hell is going
to a resort wearing that?
All right, ladies. Get ready to
put on a show, and then take it all off.
Good luck!
And remember, don't fuck it up.
-[Trixie] Your partner, are you married?
-Yeah. We got married last year.
[Trixie] My boyfriend's family,
last Christmas, they really liked me.
Then they found out about drag
and called him in a panic.
-"Don't be with somebody like that."
-[Miss Fame] For real?
{\an8}They don't like drag.
I don't understand how they don't get
{\an8}that it's just me playing a person.
His mom said, "Trixie's clown drag
makes me sick to my stomach."
[Miss Fame] Oh, my God.
They were right about one thing.
[laughter]
-This is really happening.
-[Violet] I know. Someone's going home.
{\an8}I am terrified for this elimination.
We have to be naked,
and I have the body
of a 55-year-old Irish rock climber.
Give me a fucking break!
[First chords of "Cover Girl" playing]
[RuPaul laughs]
Welcome to the main stage
of <i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i>. Well, look at you!
-It's like the gay Mount Rushmore.
-[laughter]
My bosom buddy, Michelle Visage.
You're serving a little Britney there.
{\an8}It's either this or a snake.
I chose this.
{\an8}Carson Kressly.
I'm so glad you joined the queen-dom.
{\an8}I'm glad to be here.
{\an8}And look who's back,
the other Miss Ross,
{\an8}Ross Mathews. I'm glad to have you
in my big opening.
-[Ross] That's a first.
-[all laugh]
And our extra special guest, the funniest
woman in the universe, Kathy Griffin.
{\an8}Ru, I brought my real smile
and a lot of fake hair.
{\an8}[RuPaul laughs]
-[in a deep voice] Me too.
-[all laugh]
This week, our queens were challenged
to show off
their best spring and fall fashions.
Tonight, they're ready to debut
their tear-away resort wear
in the first ever naked runway.
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.
{\an8}[RuPaul] Up first is Russia's own Katya.
[Ross] Katy-awesome.
[Katya] <i>It is my dream to walk</i>
<i>down this main stage runway,</i>
<i>and I have to do it naked!</i>
-<i>I rip off the thing...</i>
-Oh!
[Katya] <i>And I'm giving you</i>
<i>Russian red hippie realness.</i>
<i>I think they're buying it. When in doubt,</i>
<i>show 'em your asshole! I don't know!</i>
[Michelle] She dropped something.
-[Kathy] What an ass!
-[Carson] Thanks.
-No, her.
-[RuPaul] Her fringe matches the drapes!
[laughter]
{\an8}[RuPaul] Mrs. Kasha Davis.
{\an8}[Michelle] Mrs. Roper Realness.
[Kasha] <i>The runway is surreal. I get</i>
<i>to center, pull the Velcro, and I'm naked.</i>
<i>I slipped it off because my husband</i>
<i>was on the side of the pool.</i>
[Kathy] I could put
a saddle on that camel toe.
[laughter]
[RuPaul] Remember that time
Jo Anne Worley posed for Playboy?
[Michelle, Carson] No.
{\an8}[RuPaul] Sasha Belle.
{\an8}[Michelle] Diane von Fistenberg.
[Sasha] <i>I'm feeling amazing.</i>
[Sasha] <i>I'm giving you J-Lo just waking up</i>
<i>from a one-night-stand in the Bahamas.</i>
[RuPaul] Well, it looks like everybody's
got a little bit of black in them.
[RuPaul] Sasha Belle,
you could ring my bell, girl.
{\an8}-[RuPaul] Miss Fame.
-[Michelle] I want to live forever.
{\an8}[Miss Fame] <i>I'm wearing a custom Miss Fame</i>
<i>fashion poncho. And then: bam.</i>
-[Ross] Hello.
-[Miss Fame] <i>And I'm shining like a star.</i>
<i>-I'm a Goddamn brand.</i>
-[RuPaul] She serves Eve. Summer's Eve.
[laughter]
{\an8}[RuPaul] LaGuardia, Newark, Kennedy.
[laughter]
-[RuPaul] She's almost there.
-[all] Oh!
[Michelle] That's not a Brazilian,
it's an Egyptian.
[Kennedy] <i>Honey, I am feeling it.</i>
<i>Beautiful, sexy, the runway is mine.</i>
[RuPaul] She has quite
a back story going on.
[laughter]
{\an8}-[RuPaul] Tempest DuJour.
-[Kathy] She is of the day.
[Michelle] Let me just take this off.
It's a little warm in here, isn't it? Oh.
[Tempest] <i>I don't have fish to serve,</i>
<i>so I'm gonna give them crabs.</i>
-[Carson] They might as well be gold.
-[Kathy] Where did you get your belt?
-[Michelle] Red Lobster.
-[Ross] I love their cheese biscuits.
{\an8}-[RuPaul] Trixie Mattel.
-[Ross] She can't play with no balls.
[Trixie] <i>I'm valley girl,</i>
<i>she's at the resort, playing tennis.</i>
-[Michelle] Show your birdie.
-[Trixie] <i>Surprise!</i>
<i>It kind of looks like a doll,</i>
<i>so I'm giving you hinges.</i>
<i>Life in plastic is fantastic.</i>
[Kathy] A living doll.
[Rupaul]
She's like Skipper's sister, Stripper.
{\an8}-[RuPaul] Pearl.
-[Michelle] Oh.
{\an8}[Carson] That's what I call
Greek Goddess dressing.
{\an8}[Michelle] Let's see your clam, Pearl.
[Pearl] <i>My resort tear-away look</i>
<i>is tacky, '90s, Versace-inspired,</i>
<i>and bubblegum pink pearlfection.</i>
[RuPaul] It's like a runway on Ambien.
[Kathy laughs]
{\an8}-[RuPaul] Max. Brace yourself, ladies.
-[laughter]
[Max] Nothing says resort like polio.
-[all] Wow!
-[Michelle] Yes!
[RuPaul] She can strip! It's a miracle!
[Max] <i>As I'm walking down the runway,</i>
<i>I'm clinging for dear life to my crutches</i>
<i>like a wounded predator.</i>
[Michelle] This is Helmut Newton's
Nadja Auermann shoot.
-[RuPaul] Yes, it is.
-[Carson] Using her props as a crutch.
{\an8}-[RuPaul] Ginger Minj.
-[Michelle] Good morning, star shine.
{\an8}-[Ross] Look at her.
-[Michelle] Sweet little lemon drop.
-[all gasp]
-[Ross] We have a crack problem.
[RuPaul] That's the kind of crack
you'd find on the street.
[Ginger] <i>My concept is to be naked,</i>
<i>but still classy.</i>
<i>I'm southern. I like to be classy.</i>
-[RuPaul] Impressive pearl necklace.
-[Kathy] They can be so messy.
{\an8}[Michelle]
Especially when they're layered.
{\an8}[RuPaul] Jasmine Masters.
[Jasmine] <i>I drop the cocoon</i>
<i>and a butterfly is coming out.</i>
[Ross] She got circumcised, look.
[Jasmine] <i>You see a little tits,</i>
<i>a little ass and a little cuh-cuh.</i>
<i>When I dropped that cocoon,</i>
<i>baby, it was all she wrote.</i>
-[Ross] Afro, she did it.
-[Michelle] Yes, she did.
[RuPaul] Now, Jasmine appeals
to our fringe audience.
-[Carson] Yes.
-[laughter]
{\an8}-[RuPaul] Kandy Ho.
-[Carson] What did you call me?
{\an8}[Kandy] <i>I'm giving you Greek Goddess.</i>
[all gasp]
[Kandy] <i>I take my tear-away off,</i>
<i>and I'm just giving you curves.</i>
<i>I'm giving you this sexuality</i>
<i>that none of the other girls have.</i>
-[Carson] Nice buns, all three of them.
-[RuPaul] Moon over Puerto Rico.
[Kathy laughs]
{\an8}[RuPaul] Jaidynn Diore Fierce.
{\an8}-[Ross] Oh, Beyoncé who?
-[Kathy] Hi, gorgeous.
[Ross] She wishes she had those curves.
[Kathy] Oopsies, nudity!
[Ross] Was that supposed to happen?
[Jaidynn] <i>I'm giving the judges curves</i>
<i>and swerves and plumpiliciousness,</i>
<i>and I got to show the judges</i>
<i>how sexy I am.</i>
[Michelle] Touch all of this skin, honey.
[RuPaul]
I like big butts and I cannot lie.
[Kathy] No.
{\an8}-[RuPaul] Violet Chachki.
-[all] Aw.
{\an8}-[RuPaul] Blanche Dubois.
-[all nod]
[Ross] Bam, there it goes. Yes.
-[Carson] Take it easy.
-[all gasp]
-[RuPaul] The devil wears "nada".
-[Kathy] Uh-huh.
[Violet] <i>I feel great. I love being naked.</i>
<i>I love my body.</i>
<i>I'm comfortable with just a piece</i>
<i>of duct tape on and a smile.</i>
[Carson] This reminds me
to never eat, ever.
Welcome, ladies. When I call your name,
please step forward.
Ginger Minj.
Jaidynn Diore Fierce.
Pearl.
Mrs. Kasha Davis.
Katya.
Max.
Trixie Mattel.
You...
are all safe.
[RuPaul] You may leave the stage.
And while you're at it,
put some Goddamn clothes on!
[Kathy laughs]
[RuPaul] Ladies, it's time
for the judges' critiques.
-[RuPaul] First up, Sasha Belle.
-Your fall look, crustacean chic.
{\an8}-It was a little overwhelming.
-[Michelle] You're doing a nude illusion.
{\an8}Why are you showing huge,
black undergarments?
I think I was confused
by the assignment.
Well, to be fair, all of the girls
were told the exact same thing.
All right, next up, Miss Fame.
{\an8}On the runway, the looks are fantastic.
They're bold.
You look frighteningly fierce.
{\an8}And I love a pointed shoulder.
Let's go back to <i>Dynasty</i> while we can.
I thought the little blue number was cute.
I just expected a little bit more.
Next up, Kennedy Davenport.
In that spring look, you are giving me
Oprah Winfrey. [imitates Oprah] Kennedy...
-Davenport!
-Yes!
I loved your Bob Mackie butterfly.
-If you readjust the girls, the nipples--
-I can't. It's the way it's painted.
-Michelle's surgeon can fix you right up.
-Yeah.
[laughter]
Next up, Tempest DuJour.
How did it feel walking the runway?
I just recently lost a ton of weight,
so doing nude body
is a cathartic moment for me today.
-Condragulations on your weight loss.
-Thank you.
On that note, your runway look tonight,
you're wrinkly, you're droopy.
You're a thin girl now.
Let's talk about your runway numbers.
I'm not a fan of quilt-like materials
because they tend to make us look bigger.
You just lost all this weight,
and you just put on 50 pounds.
Next up, Jasmine Masters.
How are you feeling up there?
I am so happy, I'm shitting out
happiness to be here.
I loved your "Cirque de So-Gay" tube
that you popped out of.
Then I was like,
"Take off the fringy thing!"
I want to see that gorgeous body.
More nudity!
And your fall look, I don't get it.
It just looks old and dated.
[RuPaul] Kandy Ho.
Nothing says resort
like a tunic with no pants.
And I was just like, "Oh, God, I can see
her <i>chocha</i>." That's Spanish for vagina.
You're a beautiful queen.
You've got the body.
Your contouring on the other hand...
Girl, this is not a nightclub. This is TV.
It looks like you literally
contoured on a beard.
No.
[RuPaul] Up next, Violet Chachki.
In the tartan look, when you put your
thing down, flipped it, and reversed it,
-I almost fell off of my chair.
-And speaking about a reveal...
I would've somehow liked to have seen it
jujed a little, 'cause I'm getting boy.
I actually really enjoyed
seeing your real boy body.
You had that essence of those crazy skinny
models that may or may not have boobs.
Thank you, Kathy.
Ladies, I have one final question,
and I want the naked truth.
Which queen has least
impressed you thus far?
{\an8}-Sasha?
-I'd have to say Pearl.
{\an8}-[RuPaul] Miss Fame?
-Jaidynn.
{\an8}-[RuPaul] Kennedy Davenport?
-Trixie.
{\an8}-[RuPaul] Tempest DuJour?
-Ginger.
{\an8}-The naked truth, Jasmine.
-Sasha, because she just came out plain.
-All right, Kandy Ho?
-Tempest. He is mature,
but I think in drag, you have
to upgrade yourself to not bore people.
Interesting. When we did introductions
the first day, she didn't say hello.
Her first response was, "How old are you?"
I wanted to know your age because you look
older, and your look wasn't my favorite.
I just wanted to know
where you were coming from. That's it.
-All right, Violet Chachki?
-Sasha.
-She kind of faded into the background.
-How did I fade into the background?
-I wore a lobster dress.
-[laughter]
Well, thank you, ladies.
Now, while you untuck backstage,
the judges and I will deliberate.
Okay, now, just between us
gay icons, what do you think?
-[RuPaul] <i>Sasha Belle.</i>
-Her nude-illusion look was kind of messy.
That body suit sucked.
Come on.
It had a black bra.
Misunderstanding, my ass!
-[RuPaul] <i>Miss Fame.</i>
-The fall-spring looks made a statement.
She's just so pretty.
I like a little stank on my drag queens.
The proportions of Miss Fame's body
reminded me of Marlene Dietrich
in the later years.
-She had a little stank on her then.
-Yes.
-[RuPaul] <i>Kennedy Davenport.</i>
-I just ate her with a spoon.
She might get a little costume-y.
-Why is that a bad thing on a drag queen?
-No, I--
It's not like a star-trooper costume
from Party City.
I'd like to see that.
<i>Tempest DuJour.</i>
Her body suit was all saggy.
I wish she could pull it all together.
-But here's the thing, she's a costumer.
-Yeah.
The style's wrong, but the heart is right.
[RuPaul] <i>Jasmine Masters.</i>
I love the sassy kind of sister
with the NeNe Leakes hair.
-But the other outfit was so wrong.
-I want to see some fabulousness.
-Is that too much to ask for on this show?
-[all] No.
-[RuPaul] <i>Kandy Ho.</i>
-Girl, are you painting on a beard?
I had a beard once. She was wonderful,
but I don't bring her here.
[laughter]
Kandy Ho, Kandy who?
Look, don't you talk
to a 53-year-old comedian about age.
You picked the wrong panel, bitch.
[RuPaul] Violet Chachki.
Her fashion looks were high fashion,
and that's what I want to see here.
Tonight, I am getting boy
with a tape tuck.
I could not disagree with you more.
She took a risk!
-It wasn't feminine enough.
-[RuPaul claps]
Silence! I've made my decision.
Bring back my girls.
Welcome back, ladies.
I've made some decisions.
Kennedy Davenport,
you're safe.
Violet Chachki, on the runway
and on the main stage,
you took fashion risks,
and they paid off big time.
Condragulations, you are the winner
of this week's challenge.
[applause]
You'll receive a gag-worthy supply
of DKoye the product, hair care.
[applause]
{\an8}Yay, I won! I'm the winner.
I feel like I'll be saying that a lot.
Miss Fame,
you're safe.
Sasha Belle,
you're safe.
[sobbing]
Tempest DuJour, your runway presentation
left the judges feeling...
crabby.
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
Kandy Ho,
your fashion looks were worn,
and your nude illusion was,
shall we say, overshadowed.
Jasmine Masters,
your personality is off the hook,
but your runway fashions
looked off the rack.
Jasmine Masters,
-you're safe.
-Thank you.
Kandy Ho, I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
{\an8}What the fuck?
I did an amazing job.
There are other girls
who should have been in my place.
Two queens stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me
and save yourself from elimination.
[dramatic music]
The time has come...
for you to lip-sync...
for your life!
{\an8}[Tempest] <i>I'm thinking to myself,</i>
<i>"Hold your head up high.</i>
{\an8}Just show the best you have to show."
Good luck, and don't fuck it up.
{\an8}<i>I don't know what Miss Crab Lady</i>
<i>is doing in that lip sync,</i>
{\an8}but the bearded Ho is turning it out.
{\an8}Miss Tempest, she got these squiggly
arms going on, and she is living,
so I'm living for her gig, baby.
[Ginger] <i>Kandy's dance moves are fierce,</i>
{\an8}but it looks like she's gonna meet you
on the playground after school
and beat the shit out of you.
What's next, bitch, the Macarena?
[RuPaul laughs]
[cheering]
Ladies, I've made my decision.
[dramatic music]
Kandy Ho, shantay, you stay.
-You may join the other girls.
-Thank you.
Tempest DuJour,
this may not have been your day,
but I expect you
to take the world by storm.
-Thank you.
-Now,
sashay away.
<i>I could not be more proud of myself.</i>
You know, what means most to me
is what my kids see.
I want them to see
they can live their dreams,
have a chance to do whatever they want.
You're never too old or too anything.
{\an8}Condragulations, ladies.
You have been reborn, naked.
{\an8}Now remember: if you can't love yourself,
how the hell will you love somebody else?
{\an8}-Can I get an "Amen" up in here?
-[all] Amen.
{\an8}Alright now. Let the music play!
{\an8}Bye!


{\an8}[RuPaul] <i>Previously on</i>
RuPaul's Drag Race<i>...</i>
{\an8}Come on out, Kitty Girl.
{\an8}-[overlapping chatter]
-[Violet] Are you serious?
{\an8}God dammit!
{\an8}[Katya] Everyone is back.
{\an8}Each of you will be making over
an eliminated queen
{\an8}-as your conjoined twin.
-[Violet] Oh, my god.
[RuPaul] And the eliminated queen
in the winning pair
will return to the competition!
I know you're both pageant girls,
which is why this is predictable for me.
Next to the others, it didn't stack up.
I wish they looked more like breasts.
Pearl, you are the winner
of this week's challenge.
Trixie Mattel,
that means you're back in the race, girl.
Ginger Minj. Shantay, you stay.
Jaidynn Diore, sashay away.
{\an8}[Violet] I feel
I've been through the ringer.
{\an8}-It's so weird to see you over there.
-I know!
{\an8}Girl, that was crazy.
Ever since we started this challenge,
{\an8}I've not really been in a good place.
I've been in my head.
{\an8}This was my wake-up call.
Ginger, you're better than this.
{\an8}You need to make sure
you pull it together.
{\an8}[RuPaul] <i>That's okay.</i>
{\an8}-[Violet] Welcome back.
-[Ginger] Welcome.
{\an8}-[Pearl] Oh, my god.
-Thank you, guys.
{\an8}I'm back and I deserve to be here.
I'm gonna kill the next challenge.
-Thanks, Pearl, for helping me get back.
-[Violet] Why did you bring that tramp?
I can feel the sisterhood.
{\an8}Should have been the top six,
but we have a top seven, thanks to Trixie.
-You better bring your A game.
-It's a war, bitch.
You can smell the resentments,
as much as you can smell Violet's BO.
I'm pissed off, to be honest with you
and this is not a read on you
but if I walked out there
with a dress I just picked,
they would have clocked me
for not trying hard enough.
{\an8}I'm not on the same page as Pearl.
She's been relaxing.
I came here to play, and to win.
All you can do is chill the fuck out
and just do you.
It's working for me.
The dynamics have changed
since Trixie went home.
{\an8}Some people are falling to pieces,
some people are rising to the top.
{\an8}Some people are cruising
on the Pacific coastal highway.
{\an8}[coughs] I think I swallowed a feather.
{\an8}[RuPaul] <i>The winner of RuPaul's Drag Race</i>
<i>receives a one year supply</i>
{\an8}<i>of Anastasia Beverly Hills cosmetics,</i>
{\an8}<i>and a cash prize of $100,000!</i>
{\an8}<i>Our extra special guest judges</i>
<i>Demi Lovato and John Waters.</i>
{\an8}[tires screeching]
[electronic music]
Yay.
Another day. Another journey.
{\an8}Today is a new day with an extra bitch,
but one day you're in,
the next day you're out, Miss Trixie.
Is anybody excited
about what today might avail?
That's pretty fancy language
for a farm girl.
[chuckles]
I learned a few things in the big city.
-[alarm sounds]
-[Fame] Whoa.
[Ru]
<i>She done already done had herses!</i>
<i>Good morning, Baltimore. </i>
<i>Having female trouble?</i>
<i>Well, don't be a crybaby.</i>
<i>Because all you need</i>
<i>to become America's next drag superstar</i>
<i>is hairspray and polyester.</i>
<i>Oh, and don't forget to hide your pecker.</i>
[applause]
-I love Steven Spielberg.
-[laughter]
-Hello, hello, hello.
-[all] Hi!
Ladies, y'all went through it
during our little reunion last week.
So listen, this is a good time to vent...
o-fficially.
Now, in the great tradition
of <i>Paris is Burning,</i>
the library is about to be open, hey!
-Because reading is what?
-[all] Fundamental.
-That's right, children.
-Mm-hmm.
First up, Ginger Minj.
The library is open, darling.
Okay. Trixie Mattel.
Making fun of you
is like shooting clownfish in a barrel.
Unfortunately,
that's about as fishy as you'll ever be.
Miss Fame,
I think everything about you is original,
except for those lips,
those cheeks and, oh...
everything you present
to the judges on the runway.
You bitch!
Pearl, you've come out of your shell,
maybe you could use that as a butt pad?
-[RuPaul] Ooh.
-[laughter]
Violet Chachki,
you keep training those corsets, girl.
Pretty soon, your waist size
will be lower than your IQ.
Miss Fame,
you are such a talented makeup artist.
I never met anybody who's able to shove
their head so far up their own ass
without smudging their eyeliner.
Ginger Minj, I disagree with the judges.
You should bring your black hairspray
down further, full coverage.
-[laughter]
-[RuPaul] Ooh!
Katya, at this point, you should just make
like your hairline and recede.
Trixie Mattel, haute couture?
More like haute glue.
-[laughter]
-That was good.
Is that... Ben Affleck?
I must be hungry for the dick
if I think this thirsty bitch is her.
[chuckles]
Katya, now you get to increase
your hooking fee.
Thank you, <i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i>.
Fame, she wasn't funny.
It was like... crickets.
And you like...
[crickets chirping]
Miss Trixie, girl, I am waiting
for you to change that lip color,
'cause your face looks like
the back of a baboon's ass.
[laughter]
Oh, look, it's a giraffe.
No, it's a horse.
Oh, it's just Miss Violet,
serving her [neighs] realness.
Katya, where do you get your outfits?
American apparently not?
Ginger Minj, did you ever save Carol Anne
from the poltergeist in the TV?
Violet, I don't believe the rumors,
 that you took Sharon Needles' crown.
I don't believe
you're taking this one either.
Kennedy Davenport.
You've got your eye on the prize.
And the other eye on the crown.
Katya, are you confused?
The saying is,
"Young, dumb, and full of cup."
-RuPaul...
-Bitch.
The library is closed
and Pearl, the door is over there.
I'm gonna post
all of my favorite reads on logotv.com.
The winner of today's mini challenge is...
-Trixie Mattel!
-[applause]
I'm back.
Trixie Mattel has way more up her sleeve.
You've won
a $500 gift card from SequinQueen.
Thank god.
This week, we are paying tribute
to the Sultan of Sleaze,
The Baron of Bad Taste,
the legendary director John Waters.
Awesome.
From his early cult classics
like <i>Pink Flamingos</i>
to his mega hit <i>Hairspray</i>,
{\an8}<i>John worked with one of my idols--</i>
<i>the late, great Divine.</i>
{\an8}<i>And when these two worked together,</i>
<i>they made magic. Take a look.</i>
<i>I am Divine!</i>
{\an8}[pants]
{\an8}[screams]
[laughter]
Now, I hope you take
some Divine inspiration from that
because for this week's maxi challenge,
you'll be screen testing
for parts in a new Rusical
based on some
of John Waters' most iconic scenes.
{\an8}#JohnWaters4Ever.
{\an8}So I'm gonna give you a quick moment
to break into three teams.
Go ahead.
[laughter]
Pearl, me, and Violet
looked at each other and we're "ugh".
[Fame] <i>We didn't choose to be together.</i>
<i>We were the remnants left.</i>
None of us excel
in these kind of challenges.
Ladies,
we're providing wigs from Weaven Steven.
You know, to help get you into character.
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.
Our scene is called Cha Cha Heels,
and it's based on <i>Female Trouble</i>.
Can I be Dawn?
I wanted to be Dawn Davenport,
because it's a bigger part,
and I see opportunities
to just go over the top.
You know, Dawn is singing.
You can sing, right?
-No.
-[laughter]
-But aren't they all singing?
-Dawn is the most singing.
So we start listening to the music,
and she start hearing
those notes that Dawn was singing...
[roughly]
Oh, no, honey!
Lord, help us all.
{\an8}Our challenge is musical adaptations
of famous John Waters scenes.
{\an8}John Waters has a filthy,
twisted, delinquent sense of humor.
That dog over there just took a poo.
He's my hero.
{\an8}Our team gets assigned "Poo",
{\an8}which is inspired by a John Waters film
called <i>Pink Flamingos</i>.
<i>I'm playing Middle Divine,</i>
<i>Fame gets to play Bad Divine,</i>
and Pearl is playing Good Divine.
I'm trying to understand your character,
because you're playing the devilish angel.
-Huh?
-You're hovering on her shoulder.
-And then coming like this...
-There's only one part where I do that.
-Right.
-[Violet] Let's run through it.
-[Violet] That's a minor detail.
-All right.
-Sorry.
Know why I stopped there?
I feel like our voices sound the same.
We're doing the same voice impersonation.
Why don't you just be
lower and grumblier and grosser?
That's not funny. Deeper is not funny.
{\an8}Oh, my god.
-Hello, hello, hello.
-[all] Hi.
{\an8}-Hey, ladies.
-[both] Hi.
{\an8}Who's playing Divine,
and who the mother?
{\an8}-Divine. Mother.
-[Ru] Okay.
-Now, Kennedy, you're a singer.
-Yes.
-Do you sing?
-[laughs] No.
And it was so funny
'cause she was like, "Can I be Dawn?"
-I start hitting the notes. She said...
-We gotta switch.
Last week, you were criticized
for bringing too much pageantry,
so this challenge
could force you out of your comfort zone.
{\an8}This is another opportunity
for me to display a different side of me,
so there's no pageant here, baby.
{\an8}-Hi Ginger. Hi, Trixie.
-Hi, Ru.
{\an8}-Are you familiar with Divine's work?
-Mm-hmm.
{\an8}When I was younger,
I convinced my grandmother
that <i>Pink Flamingos</i> was for children,
and I wanted to be Divine.
That was a changing point in my life.
[RuPaul] Well, she was
the first drag superstar.
Now, I know that you sing. Do you sing?
-I sing.
-So this is gonna be a breeze for you.
We're gonna top
our own expectations of ourselves.
Neither of us
have ever topped anything before, so...
-Well, can't wait to see it.
-Me either.
All right, ladies, gather round.
In moments, you'll be screen testing
with the help of Michelle Visage
-and composer Lucian Piane.
-[applause]
And tomorrow on the main stage,
the category is...
-"Ugliest dress ever."
-[laughter]
So good luck and by all means,
fuck it up.
{\an8}-[both] Hi.
-Hi, Kennedy, hi, Katya.
{\an8}[Katya] <i>It's our turn to shoot.</i>
<i>We look ridiculous, which always helps.</i>
Ready to tear the house down.
[clicks tongue]
This is all about having as much fun
and going as crazy as you can.
{\an8}Our Lady J is going to lead you,
so let's begin.
-And, action!
-A five, six, seven, eight.
[laughter]
Cut. Katya, I love how
you're getting all down, keep that up.
Take two, ladies.
Cut, cut. Cut, cut, cut. Try it again.
[fumbles lyrics]
Is...?
Cut. Cut.
-Why are you so scared?
-I'm not scared.
It's just the live keyboard
kinda throwing me off.
Ain't no half-stepping this time.
Let's see if we can finish it in one take.
We'll be taking the tree down this time.
Action.
She didn't throw the thing down!
She's to drop this Christmas tree on me
as the big, final gag and then...
She forgets?
-Hi, Ginger Minj and Trixie Mattel.
-Hi.
[Trixie]
<i>Being back, I need to be flawless. </i>
I need to show the judges
made a mistake when they cut me.
All right, action.
Cut. You both can carry the tune,
so that's awesome,
but what I'm not getting
is these characters.
Uh, Ginger,
you're playing it a little too sweet.
{\an8}Sweet? Bitch, have you met me?
[both]
Cut. I think we need
a little bit more from Babs.
This is a John Waters film! Bigger!
Now it's getting lost. It's falling flat.
They want Trixie to be over the top.
Take that criticism and apply it
as much you apply glitter to your eyelid.
[Michelle]
Violet Chachki, Miss Fame, and Pearl.
Aren't you ladies Divine?
{\an8}Now it's our turn
and we're doing the song "Poo."
I know you're proud of this face, girl.
[laughter]
-Drink her in.
-It's much more than a look.
This is probably
the most iconic John Waters scene of all.
Give it all you got. And... action!
-Well, maybe just a sample.
Cut. Miss Fame, I feel
if she's trying to convince this one,
she would start maybe a little smaller
and then get bigger.
-Well, maybe just a sample.
All right.
[hums]
-[hums]
-Okay, cut.
Pearl, we need more energy from you.
-Even right now...
-Oh, imagine that.
[Lucian] I need to hear you.
But the biggest problem for me
is that you're in three different things.
Remember you're interacting.
There's a scene here.
Right now, it's like three individuals.
Ah, fuck me, dude.
Sorry, I knew my lines,
but it was hard to just jump in
when the bitch before me
didn't say her lines.
All right, let's see
what John Waters thinks of these tomorrow.
{\an8}-[Fame] Yay.
-Ugliest dress, it's finally my week.
{\an8}This week's runway look
is "the ugliest dress ever".
How did you choose your ugliest dress?
I mean, did you just go...
And pull it off the rack?
-Are you feeling good?
-Yes, really good.
Don't trust that feeling.
I already lip synced once,
I don't want to do it again.
{\an8}I'm worried because when someone gets
brought back, they immediately go home.
<i>And I am not ready to go home.</i>
She's going real soft today.
[Fame] I like how you block out
your hairline to put dark brown over...
It gets rid of the texture.
Do I talk to you
about how you do your makeup?
-No, but you should be.
-[Pearl] You're an idiot.
Bitch, you're very blessed, your talents
have taken you far, and I'm struggling.
[Pearl] It's okay,
your insecurities can take you there.
And your lack of will to be here
has really gotten you far.
{\an8}When it comes to Fame,
anyone could read her,
and she's like oh... [rolls tongue],
like, totally joins in, it's cute.
But, like, the second I would,
I always felt
some weird underlying tension.
I don't know. She's, like, odd.
What's been your big struggle with drag?
Well, my whole career has been a struggle.
[Kennedy]
It's my primary source of income.
The bookings are very scarce.
Drag, it barely paid the bills.
I have no retirement. I have nothing.
It's just a lot of sacrifices being made
because you wanted to pursue
your dream as an entertainer.
{\an8}A full time job
as a female impersonator is not easy,
<i>especially when you have bills to pay.</i>
But I stuck with drag
because entertaining is my passion.
It's the life of a working artist.
It's hard, but satisfying and exciting.
I cannot believe
John Waters is gonna be here.
Him and Divine are such legends.
It's crazy.
When I started doing drag,
I started seeing those movies,
and it made me feel like it was okay
to be as un-beautiful as I wanted to be.
I always liked to be shocking and funny
before I be pretty.
-We know.
-[laughter]
[music]
[RuPaul laughs]
[Ru] <i>And what?</i>
Welcome to the main stage
of <i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i>.
Our very own motor mouth Maybelle,
Michelle Visage!
{\an8}I can see
all your female troubles from here.
And the reigning Miss Baltimore crabs.
{\an8}-Carson Kressley!
-[laughs]
-Are you a fan of <i>Polyester</i>?
-I love the movie. Hate the fabric.
{\an8}And pop goddess Demi Lovato!
You're finally here. We're so excited.
It's an honor,
and I've wanted to do this for so long.
Does this dress make my ass look fat?
Yes.
But the ass on the front is even better.
And the man of the hour,
legendary filmmaker and author
{\an8}John Waters! Welcome.
Well, thank you, Miss RuPaul.
It's obvious which category
you fit into, the best.
-I prefer the scattergory category.
-[laughter]
This week,
we challenged our queens to sing out
in Divinely-inspired
John Waters screen tests.
And tonight, they're trashing the runway
in their ugliest dresses ever.
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the filthiest woman win!
{\an8}[RuPaul]
First up, Newark Laguardia Kennedy.
{\an8}-[Carson] It's Rose Kennedy Davenport.
-[RuPaul] Yes, honey.
[Kennedy] <i>At the church,</i>
<i>Sister Beulah Mae hits the runway.</i>
<i>I had a little accident in the back.</i>
<i>I didn't know that.</i>
[John] She's picking her seat now.
{\an8}[RuPaul] Ooh, Katya!
{\an8}[John] Terrible to waste craft week.
{\an8}[RuPaul] Crochet, you stay.
[Katya] <i>If Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio</i>
<i>barely survived a meth lab explosion</i>
<i>and then she was cast</i>
<i>in a porno musical of Raggedy Anne.</i>
<i>That is what I am giving you.</i>
[Michelle] Yeah, she's not a hooker.
She's a McCall's girl.
-[RuPaul] Knitter, please!
-[Michelle] Oh, my god.
{\an8}[RuPaul] Up next, Ginger Minj.
{\an8}Michelle's favorite color!
[Carson] It's a Tracy Turnblad look.
[Ginger]
<i>This is one of the most atrocious frocks</i>
<i>I think</i>
<i>I have ever placed upon my little body.</i>
[Demi] That's about
as lime green as Katy Perry's hair.
-[Michelle] Don't do that color.
-[Demi] Never.
{\an8}[RuPaul] Next up, Trixie Mattel.
{\an8}-[Carson] Molly Ringworm.
-[John] Baby Jane as a young girl.
[Michelle]
Romy and Matell's High School Reunion.
[Trixie] <i>This is the kind of dress</i>
<i>you'd be mortified you ever wore.</i>
<i>It's so wrong.</i>
[RuPaul] They always say
you can wear the bridesmaid dress again.
-Not true.
-[laughter]
{\an8}[RuPaul] Up next, Pearl.
{\an8}-[Carson] Very toddlers &amp; tequilas.
-[John] It's the Japanese that do that?
[Pearl] <i>Tonight I am giving you</i>
<i>cutesy, googly-eyed glam.</i>
[Michelle] I've got my Kawaii on you.
[RuPaul] Jeepers, creepers,
where'd you get those peepers?
{\an8}Violet Chachki. Come through, mama!
[John] She looks like Connie Marble.
[Violet] <i>This dress may be hideous,</i>
<i>but I'm modeling it well.</i>
[Carson] Pride flag? It's the shame flag.
[RuPaul] Her clown posse's on fire.
[laughter]
{\an8}[RuPaul]
Miss Fame, that must be her eatin' dress.
{\an8}-If it ain't brocade, don't fix it.
-[Fame] <i>I'm serving my ugly dress.</i>
<i>I'm showing this shapeless,</i>
<i>big triangle of fluff.</i>
[RuPaul] That's how Miss Fame pops a tent.
Welcome, ladies, it's time to take a look
at your John Waters screen tests.
<i>First up, Kennedy Davenport and Katya</i>
<i>in </i>Cha Cha Heels.
Come here, Dawn! Santa brought presents.
-Jesus, I'm comin'!
-Please, Dawn.
Let's not fight. It's Christmas!
I ain't gonna be singing
no Christmas carols.
Where's your Christmas spirit, Dawn?
I better be gettin' cha cha heels.
-Please, Dawn, it's Christmas!
-Dawn...
But it's Christmas! Please, Dawn!
But it's Christmas! Please, Dawn!
Ugh!
<i>Next, Ginger Minj and Trixie Mattel</i>
<i>in </i>Eggs.
-Your country breakfast is ready.
-[laughter]
Babs, I'm so hungry!
-Please come here.
-[Trixie] I'm comin', mama!
[both]
[both]
-Deeply, deeply disturbing.
-[laughter]
[RuPaul] <i>Next, Pearl, Violet Chachki,</i>
<i>and Miss Fame in </i>Poo.
-Maybe you're right.
And she also says...
-Don't listen to her!
Oh, hell, no.
-Maybe just a sample.
It's still warm!
[all]
-[man] Cut!
-I'm so glad that's over.
I'm starving.
You got anything good around here to eat?
-Absolutely filthy.
-[laughter]
All right, my Divine dolls,
time for the judges' critiques.
Let's start with Kennedy Davenport.
I don't think your look is ugly enough.
It's kind of old lady chic.
As Dawn Davenport,
you lived up to your name perfectly.
The rage was there.
It was very much a tribute to me.
-I was flattered.
-It's an honor.
You know, Kennedy,
it wasn't until just now
I realized you played Dawn Davenport,
and you are Kennedy Davenport.
-[boing]
-Welcome.
[laughter]
Next up, Katya.
You went beyond playing the straight
mother and added a new layer of filth.
You did a beautiful obscenity,
so I wanted to congratulate you.
As for this outfit... ugh, those colors.
They just... give me life.
It's all really ugly. Well done.
But I think the hippest girl in Brooklyn
would love that dress and wear it today.
All right, next up, Ginger Minj.
[Michelle]
Tonight, the color is horrendous.
Your performance as Edie
was a masterpiece.
[John] There was moments
when it looked exactly like her.
-She had some loveliness that you played.
-Thank you.
[RuPaul] Trixie Mattel.
To me, it's not terribly ugly.
There's leopard print in there, so--bing!
I think I might have actually worn this.
It's from the Gunny Sacks catalogue, 1986.
You know, in this scene in the movie,
Divine isn't angry,
so I thought there was a moment of pathos.
-You did that well.
-Thank you.
But I do feel
like Ginger outshined you a little bit.
[RuPaul] Next up, Pearl.
Your dress
is the least ugliest out of everyone's.
I'm not gonna lie. I feel cute.
With your performance,
you knew your lines.
A bit hesitant.
We're getting down to the wire here.
-Yeah.
-So you need to go forth at this point.
Yes. I didn't even understand
you were supposed to be the good Divine.
[RuPaul] Next up, Violet Chachki.
On your runway look,
more than anybody on this stage,
you nailed this challenge
because you're giving us ugly.
-It's a talent.
-Your performance as Divine.
Out of the group,
you looked the most authentic.
But I didn't quite understand the padding.
If you were gonna go full Divine, do it.
I thought the performance
was a little bit flat for me,
just because it didn't seem to me
you had your confidence with the material.
[RuPaul] Up next, Miss Fame.
Miss Fame, you need ugly lessons.
Because that dress, to me,
is incredibly elegant.
The performance wasn't my favorite.
It was put on so much.
As an actress, you don't have to say,
"Look at me, I'm bad!"
It should come naturally.
[RuPaul] At this point in the competition,
I have to ask the question:
who deserves to go home tonight and why?
-Kennedy Davenport.
-I would have to say Fame.
Because clearly, the struggle is real.
-[RuPaul] Katya.
-I would probably say Fame.
She's been in the bottom consistently
over the past three or so weeks.
-Ginger Minj.
-I would have to agree and say Fame.
I don't know
how much more she has to offer.
-[RuPaul] Trixie Mattel.
-Fame.
She dropped the ball
on her look and her performance.
-[RuPaul] Pearl.
-I love her...
But I'd probably have to agree
just based on not winning a challenge yet.
-[RuPaul] Violet Chachki.
-Trixie got to come back.
She should be looked at
with a magnifying lens, it should be her.
All right, Miss Fame,
I want to hear from you.
Fuck all these bitches.
Truth be told, there's this part of Pearl
that's too cool for season seven,
and that frustrates me
because I'm fighting to stay.
-She knows what I'm talking about.
-I don't.
I don't think
I'm too cool for season seven at all.
I'm actually really surprised
to hear that from her.
Well, my queens,
I think we've heard enough.
While you untuck backstage,
the judges and I will deliberate.
Just between us filthy, dirty girls,
what do you think?
Let's start with Kennedy Davenport.
She was hilarious. She had the anger.
She could look like a church lady and go
to a rage-filled Divine at the same time.
Even though she was doing Dawn Davenport,
she was still putting her flavor into it.
-[RuPaul] Katya.
-Katya was certainly ugly drag tonight.
Her performance,
she took this really kind of nothing role
and turned it
into something meaty and substantial.
She was not afraid to play not glamorous.
A lot of drag queens I know
are afraid to do that.
You were looking at me when you said that.
All right, moving on. Ginger Minj.
She embodied Edith Massey as the egg lady.
She really did go balls deep.
-[RuPaul] Trixie Mattel.
-As Babs, she did a good job.
It still wasn't enough
compared to what Ginger was doing.
-It's hard to compete with a Ginger Minj.
-I've tried.
-[RuPaul] Pearl.
-She's doesn't give a lot when performing.
That outfit--not only is it not ugly,
it's incredibly flattering for her.
So she does not follow directions.
Violet Chachki.
That was the ugliest dress.
[Michelle] She's posed in it,
like when Lucille wore a potato sack.
That moment of "I'm fabulous."
I think her performance was about
as talented as a colorblind makeup artist.
-[RuPaul] Miss Fame.
-She has something that I root for.
When she said, "Fuck those bitches,"
I was like, "Okay, I like her."
-Her ugly dress was not ugly.
-The performance was ugly.
If I told her to change something, "no".
She hears, but she doesn't listen.
You know who the star of that scene was?
The dog!
Silence! I made my decision.
Bring back my pussy willows.
Welcome back, ladies.
I've made some decisions.
Kennedy...
you're safe.
Thank you.
Katya, you're safe.
Ginger Minj.
This week, you gave us green... eggs...
-And hammed it up.
-[laughs]
Condragulations.
You're the winner of this challenge.
Thank you.
[RuPaul] You've won a hair-raising
custom wig wardrobe
from Weaven Steven.
{\an8}Oh, my god, I won another challenge.
{\an8}I'm the first bitch this season
to win three.
[RuPaul] Trixie Mattel.
-You're safe, <i>huevos ranchero</i>.
-Thank you.
Pearl, your dress
was not a sight for sore eyes.
And your Divine performance
was a little B.M.,
Barely Memorable.
Violet Chachki,
your ugly dress made us happy.
But your Divine performance
was kinda crappy.
Miss Fame, your ugly dress
had too much beauty
and your Divine performance
was a real doody.
Violet Chachki...
[sighs]
You're safe.
Thank you.
Pearl, Miss Fame, I'm sorry, my dears,
but you are both up for elimination.
{\an8}She called me out. I'll send her packin'.
[RuPaul] Two queens stand before me.
Prior to tonight, you were asked
to prepare a lip sync performance
of "Really Don't Care" by Demi Lovato.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me
and save yourself from elimination.
-The time has come...
-[thunder claps]
...to lip sync...
...for your life!
[Fame] <i>I hate we had to have this energy,</i>
<i>but I have to fight to be here,</i>
{\an8}and I hope and pray that I get to stay.
Good luck, ladies. And don't...
fuck it up.
{\an8}[<i>Really Don't Care</i> plays]
[Violet] <i>They said each other</i>
<i>should go home,</i>
{\an8}so I'm sure flipping each other off
came from a real place.
Ladies, I've made my decision.
Pearl... Shantay, you stay.
You may join the other girls.
Miss Fame,
your 15 minutes with us may be up,
but your legend will live forever.
Now, sashay away.
The cosmic queen departs.
[laughs]
[Fame] <i>I feel sad. This was like</i>
<i>a dream come true to be a part of this.</i>
I didn't expect it to be so challenging,
you know, and it really, really was.
<i>This experience opened up things</i>
<i>that I never would have expected,</i>
<i>There's no limitation</i>
<i>from this point forward.</i>
Maybe take a few acting classes.
But everything else, I feel like...
<i>I feel like I did good.</i>
My sickening six, condragulations.
And remember:
{\an8}If you can't love yourself, why, darn it,
{\an8}how the hell you gonna love somebody else?
{\an8}-Can I get an "amen" up in here?
-[all] Amen.
{\an8}-Can I buy a vowel?
-Yes.
{\an8}All right, well, then let the music play.
{\an8}[RuPaul] Bye!


{\an8}[RuPaul] <i>Previously on </i>RuPaul's Drag Race<i>.</i>
{\an8}This week's maxi challenge: Snatch Game!
{\an8}Whoo!
{\an8}Aaah!
{\an8}Wrong note, sugar. Shut up!
{\an8}I said, "Haunted house."
You have the look down 100%.
What was missing was everything else.
Don't come as Chaka's sister.
That's all she has to say about that.
Kennedy Davenport, Ginger Minj,
first tie in Snatch Game herstory.
Jaidynn Diore Fierce, shantay, you stay.
Max, sashay away.
-Oh, my God.
-Ooh, child.
"Love you, darlings."
My Max is gone. I'm so sad.
-It's getting real now.
-It is.
Can we talk about what RuPaul said
at the end about someone coming back?
I fear I've let
one of the eliminated queens go home...
...too soon.
-I want Jasmine to come back.
-I don't!
She's been gone for too long
to come back now.
-What about Kandy Ho?
-She can't lip-sync four times.
{\an8}How can I say this delicately?
I don't want anybody to come back.
Nobody wants that.
<i>Nice to know you. You're beautiful.</i>
Stay home.
[engine starts]
<i>The winner of RuPaul's Drag Race</i>
<i>receives a one year supply</i>
<i>of Anastasia Beverly Hills cosmetics</i>
<i>and a cash price of $100,000!</i>
<i>With True Blood's Nelsan Ellis</i>
<i>and LeAnn Rimes!</i>
[Ginger] Come on, girl.
-[Jaidynn] Good morn-ting.
-[Violet] Then there were seven.
I mean, eight.
Can we just say that we'll all
band together and go on strike?
Yes, baby.
[RuPaul] <i>Ooh, girl.</i>
<i>She done already done had herses.</i>
Be careful, my pretties.
What goes around comes around.
<i>And that bitch</i>
<i>that you threw under the bus</i>
<i>might be the one driving the Greyhound</i>
<i>next time your ass needs a ride.</i>
[horn honking]
[Violet] <i>Damn!</i>
-Hello, hello!
-Hi!
-Are you decent?
-Yes.
-Because we've got company.
-No!
Here we go.
Come on out, company.
Latrice! It's like seeing Sharon Stone,
except, you know...
fat and black.
[RuPaul] Ladies, let's face it.
Competing on <i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i>
is a lot like being in a women's prison.
So, for today's mini challenge, you need
to prove that "orange is the new drag".
Oh, pit crew!
-[Pearl] How sexy.
-[RuPaul] Hey, Latrice,
would you like to inspect
the pit crew's underwears?
Get those nuts away from my face.
All right, kitty girls, you need
to drag up these prison uniforms
using supplies from the commissary...
plus any contraband that you smuggled in.
You have 20 minutes.
Ready, set... Attica!
Welcome to Tuckahoe Prison for Ladies.
[Latrice] Drag queen walking.
You angry, ain't you? Just mad.
-I never expected to be in jail.
-Looking the way you look,
you didn't think that was a crime?
Do the time, don't let the time do you.
Don't drop the soap.
[RuPaul] All right, time's up, ladies.
It's time for the Tuckahoe Prison
fashion show.
First up, Ginger Minj.
But the others call her Wide Receiver.
{\an8}-[Latrice] I know that's right.
-[RuPaul] She's in here for burning bush.
Her dream conjugal visit
would be from the NBA.
The whole NBA.
Kennedy Davenport,
A.K.A. Ho 'N' Good Stuff.
-[Latrice] Working that side ponytail.
-[RuPaul] Sure is.
Her prison job is washing
tray underwear and cooking ramen noodles.
Ooh, look at them ashy knees.
Next up is Pearl, A.K.A. Lil' Bitch.
-[RuPaul] I wonder who Big Bitch is.
-That would be me.
Lucky you. Her prison job is nail tech.
Actually, she did my nails.
-Does she do toes too?
-She do toes too.
Miss Fame, A.K.A. Bam-Bam,
A.K.A. Sad Eyes, A.K.A. Pinky.
She got a lot of A.K.A.'s.
Call her Sad Pink Eyes for short.
Yeah. She smuggle
weave bond inside a cake.
She do weaves? Yes, girl,
no good weave goes unpunished.
{\an8}Katya, A.K.A. Olga.
{\an8}Now, her favorite prison activity
is having gingivitis.
That explains that smell.
Dental damn, girl.
She's in here for 30 years
for smuggling geese out of the Ukraine.
Violet Chachki A.K.A. Princess.
She's a bad bitch.
Her prison job is crack dealer.
I know what kind of crack she's serving.
Hey. Jaidynn Diore Fierce,
A.K.A. Slutisha.
She's here for selling something for sale.
I know what that means.
She's from Cell Block XXX.
-[RuPaul] Oh, damn, girl.
-[Violet] Yes, Beyoncé.
[RuPaul] Yes, mommy.
Nice job, ladies.
We'll be posting all of your mug shots
at logotv.com. But the winner
of today's mini challenge is...
-Kennedy Davenport!
-Oh, my God!
{\an8}Boom. I look good in orange, don't I?
Well, thank you, Officer Latrice Royale.
-Bye, Latrice.
-Bye, girl.
Now, as I promised last week,
one of the eliminated queens
is returning to the competition.
Do you want to know who?
-No.
-Not really.
All right. Are you ready?
Come on out, kitty girl.
-Oh, my God.
-Oh, no.
[shouting]
[Trixie] Oh, my God!
-Hi, Trixie.
-Hi.
Looks like I'm gonna trade some girl
some soap for some new makeup.
But wait a minute. Wait a minute.
[Miss Fame] Oh, my God!
Tempest?
-Tempest DuJour.
-Hi, Ru.
[RuPaul] Why, you old geezer.
Now, I've got this sneaking feeling
that...
-Oh, my God!
-It ain't over.
-[Jaidynn] Are you serious?
-[Sasha] What?
[laughs]
Lo and behold.
-Hey, bitches!
-What?
[Kennedy] <i>That's when all the bitches</i>
<i>start coming through the door.</i>
God damn it!
Everyone is back.
All 14 of us.
[woman screams]
Oh, my gosh.
The whole gang's back together again.
Didn't we get rid of these girls?
Why is they back?
{\an8}I'm a lil' bit con-fursed.
That's right. I invited back
all of the eliminated queens.
Which one gets to stay?
Well, that's up to you.
For this week's maxi challenge,
each of you will be paired
with an eliminated queen.
And you'll be in charge
of making her over as your twin.
-As your... conjoined twin.
-[Jaidynn] Oh, my God!
{\an8}-[Sasha] Oh, my...
-#ConjoinedQueens.
{\an8}[Violet] Real makeover.
Two queens sharing the same charisma,
uniqueness, nerve, and talent,
because the eliminated queen
in the winning pair
will return to the competition!
[RuPaul cackling]
Kennedy Davenport, since you won
the challenge, you get to pick your twin.
And then you get to pair
everybody else up.
Oh, bitch.
Damn!
-Kennedy, who's going to be your twin?
-Jasmine.
Why he got to be black?
-Who do you choose for Ginger?
-Sasha.
[Ginger] Hey, girl!
-Who do you choose for Pearl?
-Trixie.
Yay!
-Who do you choose for Miss Fame?
-Kandy.
-All right, Kennedy. For Katya?
-Kasha.
[Katya] Hello, darling.
-Who do you choose for Violet?
-Max.
[whispers] We're gonna kill this shit.
The suspense is killing me.
-Who did you pick for Jaidynn?
-Tempest.
{\an8}Kennedy knows exactly what she's doing.
I could see the cogs turning.
There's nothing physically alike
about the two of us.
And I'm not doing blackface.
Gentlemens, start your engines.
And may the best women win!
All right, I'm glad you're back.
If anybody had to come back
and be my partner, I'm glad it's you.
That's a fucking lie. I'm not happy to see
any of these bitches walk back in,
because I have fought too hard
for my spot here
to have somebody go take a vacation
to come back and join the race.
So, it seems like everybody else
will be joined at the hip or at the head.
We got to do something that stands out.
Okay, okay, we can do this.
We can make it work.
What if we connect at the boob?
Like, just share one big boob.
Yeah. No, I like it.
Yes, we need to be funny,
but we actually have to look good too.
[Ginger] Sasha Belle don't sew.
I don't sew. So...
I don't know what the hell we're gonna do
to make this sewing challenge work.
We should do something gorgeous but gross,
just like my drag.
It's pretty but nasty at the same time.
-Yeah.
-We can be beauty queens...
Like in a beauty pageant?
-Like, little kids, though.
-Yes.
-Absolutely.
-But creepy.
{\an8}There's so much to do. I'm stressed out.
But if I'm gonna be doing all of this,
I'm really happy it's for Trixie.
We can give you acne,
and I'll have perfect skin.
Yeah, okay.
-Hello, hello.
-Hi.
Welcome to<i> RuPaul's Drag Race: Reunited</i>.
Violet and Max.
-Hello.
-Hello.
Max, you have a chance to come back,
so the stakes are very high.
-Yes, ma'am.
-What is your strategy to win?
You know, taking Max's style
and really amping it up,
-and turn it a little tchotchke, tacky.
-So you're in the driver's seat.
-Yes, ma'am.
-You're still in the competition,
so you're calling the shots.
-Where will you be conjoined?
-We love corsetry.
We'll be completely hourglass together.
{\an8}Girl, please,
we don't need to see how small
{\an8}you can make your waist
with this damn corset every challenge.
-Get back to work.
-I.J.S. I'm just saying.
Miss Fame.
-Hi, Ru.
-Kandy Ho.
-Hi.
-You're an unlikely pairing.
-Did you all connect before you left?
-We never got a chance to connect at all.
But I wish I had a bit of Kandy.
She's fearless, and I'm full of fear.
There's an energy she exudes on stage
I need to have in my life to be better.
I said, "I wish I'd have had the chance
to get to know more about you,
and here's our chance
to really know who one another is."
{\an8}Miss Fame, she talks so much.
Her answers are paragraphs.
She's got such a balance
and a fearlessness about her.
Her energy is what I need. There's been
moments in my life where conversation,
it's like it goes right through my head,
and I want to be able to show who I am.
Girl, just shut the fuck up. Just shut up.
Miss Fame, you've talked about
being too cerebral and in your head.
-Yeah.
-And, in fact, how is your head?
-You know, I was talking with her--
-See, that's it right there.
-You missed that joke.
-I missed--
Wait a minute. Stop it.
You have to listen.
I've said that to you several times.
"How is your head?"
The answer's roaming around,
but you have to listen.
So I'm gonna ask you again.
Miss Fame, how's your head?
Fine.
Are you kidding me?
No, but knock it out of the park.
Can't wait to see you as twins.
-Thank you, Ru.
-All right.
-Ginger and Sasha.
-Hey.
Isn't this crazy? It's totally wacko.
That's kind of how I feel.
I'm not gonna lie.
So you're not happy about this.
What is your strategy to win?
We said, "Let's do something
that's completely outside of the box,
and let's be joined at the nipples."
-Ex-squeeze me?
-Exactly.
Yeah, we want huge, huge boobs.
{\an8}Y'all better not try to have no kids.
No kids gonna suck on them titties.
-This is what keeps us together.
-This is gonna be quite interesting.
Girl, I'm worried. I feel
this looming presence over me saying,
"Something's about to knock you down
to the bottom, and this might be it."
All these hoes will make me feel
like it's day one all over again.
I know, day fucking one.
{\an8}We have to make up the bitches
that went home to be our conjoined twins.
-Katya.
-Hi.
-And Mrs. Kasha Davis.
-Hello, darling.
-This is your big chance to come back.
-I know.
-So what's your idea?
-We're aging hookers from Atlantic City.
-Aging hookers?
-We were born connected by our vaginas.
-But we make do with the other orifices.
-There's several other options.
And we have worked together,
which wasn't my best work.
That's right.
I don't mean to harp on negativity,
but you two worked together
when you got booted.
{\an8}We have worked together,
and it never really flowed that well.
We want to welcome... welcome you
to the first annual Despy Awards.
I'll let you get back to work.
-You have lots of conjoining to do.
-Conjoining.
If I have to go home,
and one of those eliminated whores stays,
I'm gonna have a wonderful time
going to their house and burning it down.
-Well, Kennedy and Jasmine.
-Hey.
Jasmine, how happy are you to be back?
As happy as a ship full of sailors
and one hot hooker.
-That's real happy!
-Yes.
Why did you choose Jasmine?
We come from the same background
as far as drag is concerned.
-Okay.
-And I can make her look like me.
If you're really good,
Jasmine gets to stay.
I would really like that.
She has a lot to offer.
I hope we are the winners,
so she can come back.
-Wow.
-We gonna whip it good.
Whip these hoes' asses, honey.
-Bitch, don't fuck it up.
-Yes, ma'am.
Get back to work,
and I'll see you in a minute.
-Right.
-Right.
You see where the fire is, all right.
Bitch, I'm back up in this piece.
-Tempest and Jaidynn.
-Hey, Ru.
I got to say, of all of the twins here,
you two are the oddest couple.
Yes, honey.
-What are you planning?
-We're gonna do some disco divas,
-some disco mammas.
-Really?
Our back story
is that our mamma was the whore of 54.
And then one night, she had
multiple partners that created us.
We wanted to play on our size differences,
so my "business" is in her back.
-[Jaidynn] Like this.
-[Tempest] You can see us both.
-This time, you got to bring it double.
-Double duty.
-Duty, duty, duty.
-Yes.
-Hashtag "double duty."
-Okay.
-We ready, boo.
-Get back to work.
-All right.
-Thanks, Ru.
We have to slay this,
because I ain't going home.
-Pearl and Trixie.
-Hi, Ru.
-Hi, RuPaul.
-Together again.
-I know.
-Again.
Let's see. Trixie, what more
do you have to show us?
Before I left in a lip-sync accident,
I was told by the judges,
"You're funny, but you're not going for
gold." And so that's what I want to do.
Every chance you step out on that stage
is your chance to do it.
There are no dress rehearsals in life.
You've got to take those opportunities.
-So what's the strategy?
-There's always a prettier twin.
-Yeah.
-That's us.
We want to look related,
but possibly in an in-breeding accident.
All right, you kids get back to work.
Cannot wait to see your conjoined twins.
{\an8}I'm bringing everything I had before
with new fire under my ass,
because I know what it's like
to fucking lip-sync and go home.
It's not cute. It's not cute at all.
{\an8}[Violet] Is this you guys
making it sexy? Or very slutty.
That was a compliment, not a read.
Now I tell people when it's a compliment.
-You have changed the most.
-Do you think so?
-That was sarcasm.
-No, in a positive way.
{\an8}I am most impressed
with the change in Violet. I'm blown away.
{\an8}She's much nicer. She's not just biting
and sending out insults.
She's a contender,
and I think that's a great thing.
[Sasha] Temp, I'm so happy to see you.
{\an8}Can I get a cut?
[Sasha] Ooh, I like that fabric.
-Girl.
-[Sasha] How's the game been for you?
I'm pulling the look together
for the both of us. We should be a team.
-[Sasha] Are you insane yet?
-I was gagged.
[Violet] You have no idea.
Come with me.
I need to take a moment
to process my feelings
before I go all Yosemite Sam and explode.
I love Sasha, but she's not pulling
her weight. I'm not a sewer's sewer.
-I'm not good enough for two people.
-Yeah.
If I went home,
I wouldn't expect to be brought back.
They went home for a reason.
I'm just freaked out.
{\an8}[Jasmine] She look
like her nerves are bad.
{\an8}-Who?
-Ginger.
{\an8}She don't want none of us back.
This is the most nervous I've seen Ginger.
She's almost completely shutting down.
If I go home, I want it to be
because of something I did or didn't do.
We've really got to do something
to pull this together
{\an8}-Good morning.
-Back in the messy workroom.
Come on, wig.
{\an8}Today is our conjoined twin runway.
Someone's staying,
and it could possibly be Max.
-Are you ready for the challenge?
-I'm ready, honey.
-We're gonna be sickly now.
-Yes.
{\an8}It's awesome to be back
with my bitch Jasmine.
But she's been a lot of sadness
ever since she left.
I told her to hold her head up.
You still have your dignity.
You still are Jasmine Masters.
And Jasmine tells me that no one
has ever told her to keep her head up.
Bitch, if I get back up in here,
I'm slaying, bitch.
I ain't holding my shit back.
She had a bad run,
but everybody deserves a second chance,
and I do believe she has
a lot to offer this competition.
-Has anyone ever painted you before?
-No, especially someone who looks like me.
I'm thinking about what my sweet...
devout Mormon mother
is gonna be thinking about all this.
-She's never seen the show but...
-Oh, yeah?
I did the whole reparative therapy thing,
trying to turn straight.
-Oh, dear!
-Yeah.
I did the whole conversion
to be straight therapy.
It was horrible. It's all about,
"You've got to pray harder, fast harder,
and date girls." Like it's suddenly
gonna turn you straight.
-Damn.
-It nearly destroyed me.
{\an8}Talking about personal issues
and upbringings gives us an opportunity
to show those kids who are struggling
that there's someone who can empathize.
You know the suicide rate in gay kids
is way above the national average, right?
-It...
-It breaks your heart.
-It's crazy.
-It destroys lives.
Lucky for you, you had a realization
about who you were in reality.
It's kind of a miracle, and it's something
I'm really grateful for every day.
If you can help one kid
live another day, then it's worth it.
[Miss Fame] Is your mom
the closest person you have?
-Oh, yeah.
-Was she a single mom?
No. They broke up when I was young,
but she's been married for 16 years.
-[Trixie] Talking about your family?
-[Kandy] My step-father.
[Trixie] I had a step-dad too,
but we weren't close.
He was super abusive. I was over it.
The police actually took me out
of my home when I was 15.
-That's pretty sad.
-Yeah, it kind of sucked.
You don't really have a clear perception
of abuse, because it's all you know.
Right, exactly.
{\an8}I had a hard time with my step-dad.
If I was being too sensitive or acting
too feminine, he would call me a trixie.
For years, that was one of the worst words
I could think of, so I took that name
and it used to have all this hurt to it,
and I made it my drag name,
and now it's something I celebrate.
If I hadn't gone through all that shit,
Trixie Mattel might not even exist.
[<i>Cover Girl</i> playing]
Welcome to main stage
of <i>RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
Michelle Visage, you brought the twins.
{\an8}I did. They wanted to come out
and say, "Hey, kitty girl."
{\an8}Super judge Ross Mathews,
are you up for some double trouble?
-Is it triple-X?
-Ha-ha-ha!
{\an8}And one of my favorite actors,
Nelsan Ellis.
{\an8}Baby, this ain't <i>True Blood</i>.
This is <i>Ru Blood</i>.
-Hi, Ru-alicious, dipped in beauty.
-So happy you're here.
-It's good to be here.
-And LeAnn Rimes,
{\an8}-how are you? You look gorgeous.
-Thank you, I'm so good.
{\an8}I don't know what I got myself into,
but I can't wait.
This week, our queens were challenged
to reconnect with former rivals.
And now, they're ready to make
their conjoined runway debut.
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best twinsies winsies.
{\an8}[RuPaul] First up,
Miss Fame and her twin, Kandy Ho.
{\an8}[Michelle] Sexy, sexy sutures.
This look is a staple on the runway.
[RuPaul] Yes.
[Miss Fame] <i>I'm in love with</i>
<i>this fierce surgical sisters look.</i>
<i>I'm giving you full surgical realness.</i>
[RuPaul] Conjoined twins are like buses.
You don't see one all day,
and then two come at once.
[Michelle] Exactly.
{\an8}[RuPaul] Jaidynn Diore Fierce
and her twin, Tempest DuJour. Disco divas.
Tempest is my plus-one.
[Jaidynn] <i>We done tripped out of Studio 54</i>
<i>right onto the runway. Get into the disco.</i>
[Tempest] <i>I feel like a pioneer woman</i>
<i>who's being pulled by an oxcart.</i>
[LeAnn] Jaidynn, don't have
Mexican for dinner.
{\an8}[RuPaul] Kennedy Davenport and her twin,
Jasmine Masters. Sister, sister.
Take that, Tia and Tamara.
[Kennedy] <i>We are giving</i>
<i>fashion model turns</i>
<i>and we are serving up</i>
<i>Cotton Club realness.</i>
[Michelle] One Beyoncé short
of a Destiny's Child.
[LeAnn] Oh, my gosh.
{\an8}[RuPaul] Pearl and her twin,
Trixie Mattel.
{\an8}Come on, let's go.
[RuPaul] Mama always said
Pearl was the pretty one.
[Michelle] And she wasn't lying.
[Pearl] <i>We're doing this weird routine</i>
<i>where she won't cooperate.</i>
[Trixie] <i>I'm taking every opportunity</i>
<i>to reach for the joke.</i>
<i>I need to show the judges</i>
<i>that they made a mistake.</i>
-[RuPaul] Trixie, how's your head... gear?
-[Michelle] She gives good headgear.
{\an8}-[RuPaul] Violet Chachki and Max.
-[Nelsan] They have a <i>Chicago</i> look.
-[RuPaul] Yes, they do.
-[Ross] Roxie Hard-on.
[Violet] <i>We're trying</i>
<i>to move symmetrically.</i>
<i>We are serving</i> Carnivàle<i>,</i>
<i>Cirque du Noir, and I'm living.</i>
[LeAnn] I'm jealous of their asses.
[RuPaul] What a two-faced bitch.
{\an8}Ginger Minj and her twin, Sasha Belle.
{\an8}-[Michelle] Milk time!
-[RuPaul] Yes.
[Ross] Naomi and Wynonna Jug.
[Ginger] <i>Sasha Belle and I are giving</i>
<i>new meaning to bosom buddies.</i>
<i>We are attempting to serve you</i>
<i>some Peggy Bundy realness.</i>
[RuPaul] They definitely win
breast in show.
{\an8}Katya and her twin, Mrs. Kasha Davis.
{\an8}It's so good to see Joan
and Jackie Collins back together again.
[laughter]
[Katya] <i>We are giving old, Atlantic City,</i>
<i>pussy-connected, leather-skin realness.</i>
-[Michelle] They'll hit the slots.
-[Ross] They'll play the slut machines.
[RuPaul] Welcome, ladies.
Now it's time for the judges' critiques.
First up, Miss Fame
and her twin, Kandy Ho.
It's been done a few times,
the whole plastic surgery thing.
I agree. It's the least creative
of the conjoining, just at the hip.
Miss Fame, how's your head?
I've never had any complaints.
Got it!
-I am so proud of you.
-It took me weeks!
Next up, Jaidynn Diore Fierce
and Tempest DuJour.
Your legs stretch up to the heavens.
-Are you talking to me?
-Yeah.
I thought the concept was really cute.
It's a bit basic.
It's a tough stage
for y'all to be on tonight.
[RuPaul] Next up,
Kennedy Davenport and Jasmine Masters.
I know you're both pageant girls,
which is why this is predictable for me.
Michelle, I just disagree.
You walked out here,
and you held your poise and your face,
but in that great kind of stupid I love.
We was thinking
Miss Ella and Miss Billie Holiday meet up,
and we're fighting for the mic,
and she always singing my note.
When you describe that, I totally get it.
I wish you would have brought that more.
Next up, twisted sister Pearl
and her twin, Trixie Mattel.
Good evening,
distinguished panel of judges.
This storyline is magical. I can't look
without cracking up at you, Trixie.
That's to your detriment, Pearl.
She's stealing the show from you.
It was nice to see Trixie shine.
And Pearl, you were in there with it.
-Thank you.
-Next up, Violet and her twin, Max.
-Oh, my God!
-Yeah, yeah!
It took Violet to get Max
to give me what I wanted.
-Honestly, I'm feeling this.
-She's gorgeous!
-I thought y'all told your story.
-Thank you so much.
But there was a lot of pressure to do
something that would make us bust a gut.
-And you didn't do that.
-Next up, Ginger Minj and Sasha Belle,
A.K.A. A Tale of Two Titties.
I love the idea.
I'm not crazy about the execution.
There's something white on the bottom
of your boobs, Ginger. What is it?
It might be hot glue.
I hot-glued this to me.
The boobs,
I wish they looked more like breasts.
Next up, Katya and her twin,
Mrs. Kasha Davis.
Listen, she's older than dirt,
but I know true talent when I smell it.
And she smells
like she just pissed herself.
I haven't laughed as hard
as I did tonight when you guys came up.
I've seen these women up at the casino
at the slot machines.
-The casino, the bingo hall.
-Yes!
-Sometimes you got to get ugly to win.
-High five. Ugly-beautiful.
-Miss Fame did our makeup. Can you tell?
-I know, she's so good!
Thank you, Katya. Thank you, ladies.
While you untuck backstage,
the judges and I will deliberate.
Between us quintuplets, what do you think?
Let's start with Miss Fame and Kandy Ho.
In this season, we've seen
a plastic surgery thing already.
Really, that's the best that you can do?
It's too easy, and the stakes
are too high to go so basic.
<i>Jaidynn Diore Fierce and Tempest DuJour.</i>
Standing next to the other queens
on this stage, it didn't stack up.
I wanted something more
and I think they could have brought it.
[RuPaul] <i>Kennedy Davenport</i>
<i>and Jasmine Masters.</i>
I wish they'd gone over the top
with crowns, sashes, and flowers
and did the whole thing, over the top.
If they had connected at the head
or something a little weirder,
it would have worked better.
-[RuPaul] <i>Pearl and Trixie Mattel.</i>
-They were absolutely stunning.
-How fun was this?
-They were the best storytellers.
-[RuPaul] <i>Violet Chachki and Max.</i>
-They could've gone over the top,
but it would have taken away
from their beauty.
The biggest moment was me seeing Max
in a different light, and I loved that.
[RuPaul] <i>Ginger Minj and Sasha Belle.</i>
I couldn't get past the costume,
the construction.
I don't think I minded how shoddy it was
because it looked a bit like John Waters,
and that was always low-budget.
-But he attitude didn't sell that.
-It just felt, no pun intended, flat.
[RuPaul] <i>Katya and her sister,</i>
<i>Mrs. Kasha Davis.</i>
They brought the funk and the fun.
They brought the house down.
-Not to mention they were conjoined...
-[both] At the vagina!
-[Ross] <i>Yeah.</i>
-What's better than that?
Silence. I've made my decision.
Bring back my girls.
Welcome back, ladies.
I've made some decisions.
Pearl, as a conjoined twin,
the judges found you creepy and sad.
Pearl, condragulations.
You are the winner of this challenge.
Trixie Mattel, that means
you're back in the race, girl.
{\an8}I'm back, yay! I thought I was,
"Fourth episode, queen, bye."
I thought I was Mimi Imfurst.
Now I'm, "Me, me, I'm second chance."
Pearl, you've won your very own
custom website from Squarespace,
-plus a fabulous weekend in New York...
-Oh, hey!
...where you'll meet
with the Squarespace team
-to make your portfolio and online store.
-Yes!
{\an8}This story has come full-circle,
taking Trixie out and bringing her back.
-Katya, you're safe.
-Thank you.
-Kennedy Davenport, you're safe.
-Yes!
Jaidynn, your disco inferno
did not set the judges' pussies on fire.
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you're up for elimination.
Violet Chachki.
-You're safe.
-Thank you.
Miss Fame,
your plastic surgery story needed work.
Ginger Minj, you served tatas with hahas,
but the execution was... wah-wah.
Ginger Minj, I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
{\an8}Frankly, I'm not surprised.
Stevie Wonder could see this one coming.
[RuPaul] Miss Fame, you're safe.
Two sets of conjoined queens
stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me and save yourselves...
from elimination.
The time has come...
for you to lip-sync...
for your life!
Good luck, and don't fuck it up.
[Jaidynn] <i>I got this big girl</i>
<i>strapped to my back, and I'm serving</i>
<i>hashtag "the best I can do</i>
<i>right now in the situation."</i>
[Katya] <i>Ginger and Sasha</i>
<i>are giving themselves a mastectomy. </i>
{\an8}Tempest and Jaidynn look like Larry Bird
and Raven-Symoné in a butt-fuck position.
This is the most epic lip-sync ever!
No matter how much fun we are having,
this is my last chance.
<i>This is</i> The Hunger Games <i>of drag,</i>
<i>doing whatever the hell it takes to win.</i>
[cheers and applause]
Wow. That was outrageous!
Now, I've made my decision.
Ginger Minj, shantay, you stay.
Thank you.
You may join the other girls.
Jaidynn Diore, your first, middle,
and last name should be Fierce.
Your passion brought you here.
Share it with the world.
Now, sashay away.
Thank you so much. I'm just so happy
that I got to have this experience.
Thank you.
Thank you.
[Jaidynn] Love y'all.
I love you, baby.
Work that puss.
[Jaidynn] <i>I'm a little bit devastated,</i>
but I stayed as strong as I could,
and I learned a lot about myself.
I learned that I just want to be loved
and accepted for who I am, truly.
[RuPaul] Condragulations, ladies.
{\an8}And remember, if you can't love yourself,
how you gonna love somebody else?
{\an8}Unless, of course,
that somebody else is attached to you.
{\an8}-Can I get an "amen" up in here?
-Amen!
{\an8}All right, now let the music play.
{\an8}[Michelle] Bye.<i>-Previously on</i>
<i>"RuPaul's Drag Race"...</i>
You'll be working in pairs
to create
presidential campaign ads.
-I immediately was like--
[trills tongue]
I wrote 30 pages.
-Damn, Thorgy.
-Every team is going to hope
that Bob and I fail.
Why?
[laughter]
<i>-But we both want to win.</i>
-[cackles]
[laughter]
-I think we got everything.
-Do you want a shot
of Chi Chi drinking booze?
-I think I'm good.
-Okay.
-Thorgy Thor.
-I got totally confused
when you didn't say
anything about the booze.
-There were too many ideas.
-Chi Chi DeVayne.
-We just had
to push you a little bit
for you to be in your skin.
-Just be you.
Honey, that's why we sent you
a plane ticket.
-[RuPaul] Bob The Drag Queen
and Derrick Barry.
-I would love to see
a fully realized
glamasaurus rex.
-Okay.
-Don't just give us
that same old pretty makeup.
Show us something
completely different.
-Condragulations.
You are both the winners
of this week's challenge.
-Chi Chi DeVayne,
shantay, you stay.
-Thorgy Thor.
Sashay away.
[relaxed music]
-Mmm.
-Whoo, mama.
-Goodness.
-Girl.
-Poor Thorgy.
-I cannot believe
that all happened.
-That was a--
that was a rough one.
-That was, like,
so emotional.
-"Please take down Bob.
She's terrible."
-[laughs]
-"Anyway, love you guys.
"Top three,
Naomi, Bob and Deryk.
That was shady.
Thorgy."
-There you have it, girl.
-Whoa, that was really shady.
<i>-[Kim Chi] Damn, Thorgy.</i>
But you're not here anymore,
so I guess it really
doesn't matter, huh?
-I thought we had
a special connection.
-Well, you realize
that's so typical Thorgy.
I mean,
that's my homegirl.
I was so excited to see her
when I got here.
And I was sad to see her go.
<i>-[Bob]  Even though she got</i>
<i>competitive with me,</i>
that's Thorgy.
I love her anyway.
<i>And I really am gonna miss her.</i>
That was a lip-sync
for the ages, mama.
-That was epic.
-I'm at a loss for words,
'cause it was so unexpected.
Child, I'm gonna erase
this shit.
<i>-[Chi Chi] Real talk, y'all?</i>
Derrick's ass should've
been lip-synching tonight,
and I know I'm not
the only girl
that's thinking it.
-When they said that
Derrick was in the top,
I was like, "Okay,
I did not see that."
-That's where her jealousy
kicked in.
<i>-[Kim Chi] Purely based</i>
<i>on the runway look,</i>
I think Derrick should've
been in the bottom.
<i>Derrick's black-and-white</i>
<i>runway</i>
<i>looked like he stepped</i>
out of the thrift store
bargain sale day.
-Bob and I
smeared the shit
out of each other
like Ru told us to do,
so I felt like Bob and I won.
I think the other queens,
those bitches better be scared,
because now I'm competition.
Oh, you didn't win a challenge?
<i>Oh, I did?</i>
And I didn't have to do
anything Britney to win.
-I think it was your ensemble
that they read you for.
Your outfit.
-Yeah, I think that's
where all the negative was.
And they want you to start
carving yourself.
-It's just funny to me,
because this is my drag.
-First let's start with
blocking those brows down
and changing your paint.
Derrick paints
like a real woman would paint,
and that's not drag.
-The thing is, they have seen
this look from you,
so I think they want to see
something else you can do
with a higher arch brow--
-Yeah, and I get that.
I get that,
that I really didn't
change my makeup
besides doing black and white,
but I wanted to look
like an old movie star.
-I'll tell you this.
If they tell you to do
more draggy, block that brow.
-Yeah.
-Bring it up to your goddamn
fuckin' hairline.
-Right.
If I come out, and I do not
have my brow raised,
there is no excuse
for me to be here.
-Derrick talking about
she gonna change her makeup,
do this, do that.
<i>Like, girl, we've been telling</i>
<i>you that from the beginning.</i>
Like, what the fuck?
-Oh, my goodness.
-Girl, it is too damn late.
[dramatic music]
-Oh!
-Bye, boo-boo.
<i>[car engine starts]</i>
<i>-The winner</i>
<i>of "RuPaul's Drag Race"</i>
<i>receives a one-year supply</i>
<i>of Anastasia</i>
<i>Beverly Hills cosmetics</i>
<i>and a cash prize</i>
<i>of $100,000.</i>
<i>With extra special</i>
<i>guest judges</i>
<i>David and Amy Sedaris!</i>
-Oh!
-Whoo!
Fantastic five!
-[laughs]
<i>-[Naomi Smalls] Today is gonna</i>
<i>be super important</i>
because the crown is so close
you can taste it,
<i>and you do not</i>
<i>want to be that bitch</i>
that got sent home so close.
[siren wails]
all: Whoo, girl.
She done already done
had herses.
<i>-Now, they say you can't</i>
<i>judge a book by its cover.</i>
Ha!
<i>You need to grow</i>
<i>a spine, girlie.</i>
<i>Be a real page-turner.</i>
<i>And for the love of God,</i>
<i>don't forget to tuck</i>
<i>your bookworm.</i>
-Hello, hello, hello.
all: Hi!
-Ladies, at this point
in the competition,
you're family.
And sometimes, to bring sisters
closer together,
it's good to do
some family role-playing.
And we're gonna do it
with puppets.
[cheers and applause]
Why?
all: 'Cause everybody
loves puppets.
-Everybody love puppets.
[laughter]
Pick a puppet that represents
one of your competitors,
and drag it up.
First up, Kim Chi.
-All right, girl.
-Dig deep for a puppet.
Who is it?
-Chi Chi.
-Oh, no.
-All right, next up,
Chi Chi DeVayne.
Oh, dear.
Ooh!
-[gasps]
-It's--
-Derrick Barry.
[laughter]
-I have Bob The Drag Queen.
-[Bob] They gave me hair.
That was nice.
[laughter]
-Next up, Derrick Barry.
-Ooh!
-The hair!
[laughter]
-I got Naomi.
-All right, Naomi.
Vogue over to the hole.
-Kack-k-k-kack
ka-kack-ka-kack, pow.
-Derrick Barry.
-It's gonna be even worse
than her snatch game.
-All right, Bob, you're up.
-Kim Chi!
-Yay!
-Look at Kim Chi go.
Oops! Oh, no!
[laughter]
Oh, shit!
[laughter]
-All right, ladies.
You have 20 minutes
to drag up your puppets.
Go.
-All right!
[upbeat music]
-I need the tiniest lashes
possible for Derrick.
-Wow.
I wear 301s, cunt.
-Okay, let me get the fabric
that is the cheapest,
without a sparkle, for Naomi.
-Because I don't have
to rely on fabric.
-You do have to rely on
your body, though, apparently.
-Oh, snap.
<i>Derrick and Naomi,</i>
I think they're getting
tired of each other.
-Wow.
-Remember, honey.
I paint for
the Las Vegas stage,
where you actually have
to look like someone.
You just have
to look like Raven.
-No, I have my own
drag aesthetic.
It's called Naomi Smalls.
-Mmm.
It's called Naomi Smalls?
Keep giving me material, honey.
-Ooh!
-Time's up, ladies.
Let the bitch fest begin.
Coming to the stage, Kim Chi.
I used to be 350 pounds.
And what did you
get down to?
349.
Oh, my God!
Condragulations, girl.
Well, the camera adds
ten pounds.
I ate, like, seven cameras.
Do you have a bit
of a speech impediment?
Speech impediment?
Oh, my God!
Kim, this is ridiculous.
Thank you.
Bye, Kim.
Oh, fuck.
-All right, this is Kim Chi.
And--oh, Chi Chi,
you're still here.
[laughter]
Ooh, um, the judges keep
telling you the word titties,
and all I can see
is your boy nipples.
Shit.
I'm a cheap queen.
Let's talk about
your two-inch heels.
[laughter]
They coming to the stores,
I paid 100 bucks.
When I saw the bag,
it said $14.99.
Why does your hair bump
never blend in to your hairline?
<i>-Bitch, my hair is blended in.</i>
Most of the time, girl.
-See, I told you,
I'm a cheap queen.
-So, Naomi, I'm wondering.
Is this your roller girl look,
neon look,
or Madonna kimono look?
They're all the same.
[laughter]
<i>[dopey music]</i>
-No, ma'am.
I have never looked like that
in my entire life.
I would never wear some
shake and go Beyoncé wig.
-There's one thing
I do want to talk--
Ooh, you're doing
a split, girl.
That's the most talented thing
I think I've seen you do
on this competition.
-Damn, Derrick,
you are cutting deep, bitch.
<i>This is a puppet show.</i>
Kids are here.
-The one thing
I want to talk to you about
is your snatch game.
Your New York was really bad.
-Damn, shady.
-Oh, Flavor Flav!
No, you didn't!
Okay, try to do that.
[monotone]
Oh, Flavor Flav.
Oh, no, you didn't.
-Derrick, does it hurt,
me having my hand inside you?
No, I'm used to sitting on
two dicks at one time.
[laughter]
<i>-[Bob] Derrick and Naomi,</i>
<i>they're like Tom and Jerry.</i>
Like NeNe Leakes
and Kim Zolciak.
-Derrick,
tell me about your drag.
Well, I don't really
have a drag style.
There is no Derrick Barry.
There is Britney Spears.
But I hand-sewed
this piece of fabric
that's just buttoned up
around my waist.
[laughter]
-That sucked.
-Hey, everybody.
I'm Bob The Drag Queen.
Hey, Bob, how you doing?
I'm doing well.
I talk a lot.
I work at every club
in New York.
[laughter]
I have a big mouth!
I think I'm all that,
even though my wigs
look like Chi Chi's.
Yeah!
Jokes, jokes, jokes,
jokes, jokes, jokes, jokes.
So what are you gonna do
when you run out of jokes?
I know what I'll do.
Walk into the club purse first.
Bam!
[laughter]
Walk into the club purse first.
Bam!
New York, baby!
[laughter]
-Wow.
So you bitches
just didn't hold anything back,
did you?
The winner
of today's mini challenge is...
Chi Chi DeVayne.
-Whoa!
[cheers and applause]
-I never lose a challenge.
[laughter]
-All right, ladies.
For this week's maxi challenge,
we're having a book ball.
-[laughs]
Oh, word.
-Now, in honor
of our guest judge,
author and humorist
David Sedaris...
[cheers]
I'm challenging you
to put together
three different looks
that tell the story
of your life.
First category is
Baby Drag Realness.
You know, when you were
five years old,
and you slipped
on those first pair of heels?
Second category is
That's My Mama Realness.
A drag look that pays tribute
to your own sweet mama.
Third category is
Autobiographical
Eleganza Extravaganza!
A couture creation
made entirely...
out of books.
-Ooh.
-Oh.
-#RuPaulBookBall.
[laughter]
For your first two looks,
you can use clothes,
shoes, and accessories
from the Out of the Closet
Thrift Store.
Gentleman, start your engines,
and may the best woman win!
[cheers and applause]
-Is that really how I sound?
How Derrick did my puppet?
-Is that really how I sound?
You're like Paris Hilton.
It's just like
giving me one note.
-Damn.
-I actually thought
that was very clever.
-You're not mad at it?
-No.
-Oh, cool.
-Not at all.
Bitch, I have tough skin.
-It looks like it.
-[scoffs]
You really testing out that
tough skin, ain't you, girl?
-And Derrick has thin hair.
-Ha-ha!
-[squeals]
[laughter]
-Wow.
I also have a career
with my wigs on.
You'll have a career once
you start gluing yours down.
-Baby.
-Popcorn.
[crunches]
-The fun thing
about Naomi is
she only has one thing to say.
And then she has
to think for, like,
hours to come with another read.
-[crunches]
-I have one thing to say.
I'm not that smart.
-Whoa.
-Were you upset by my puppet?
-I honestly don't remember
what you said.
-Everything was factual.
-[laughs]
-Why do you guys
hate each other?
Can't you guys just get along?
God damn it.
-I do not hate Derrick.
I do not like his drag.
-This is getting intense.
-You don't hate me;
you just hate my drag.
-There, exactly.
-Yeah.
-It's gonna
get severe up in here!
[laughter]
It's gonna get severe
up in here.
Gat, gat, boom!
<i>-[Chi Chi] Derrick and Naomi</i>
are starting World War III
in this bitch.
Y'all is going for blood
today.
The shit has hit the fan,
honey.
-This week's challenge
is the Book Ball.
<i>We have to come up</i>
<i>with three looks.</i>
So we have Baby Drag,
a mama look, and Book Drag,
where we have to design
a high fashion costume
out of books.
-Watch out
for the paper cuts, ladies.
-Hey, sexy librarians.
all: Hi!
Hello!
-Hi, Derrick Barry.
-Hi, Ru.
-You're cutting up my book.
-I know.
My Eleganza Extravanganza
is taking elements of your book
and mixing them
with famous paintings.
Because I feel like
celebrity female impersonation
is such an art form.
-Right.
But you've come
under a lot of fire
in terms of aesthetic.
And also last week, the judges
called you out on your makeup,
specifically to make
it look more draggy.
'Cause you paint.
You just paint what's there.
Do you know how to paint
an illusion on your face?
-Yes.
I will definitely be
giving you a brow.
-Yes, darling.
-Definitely, darling.
-If the judges
want me to wipe my eyebrow out
and draw on a new one,
I'm gonna do that.
<i>I'm ready to take a risk,</i>
and I want to show the judges
I came here
to really challenge myself.
-Why, Chi Chi DeVayne.
-Hey, Ru the Q.
-What are you gonna do
for your Mama Drag look?
-My mother,
to me she's high glam.
She always wears platinum
blonde hair, long eyelashes.
She loves leopard.
She's a party girl.
I definitely get my ability
to dance from my mom.
I didn't realize it
until we went to,
<i>like, a wedding one time.</i>
Lady know how to cut a rug.
-Now, tell me this.
What are you gonna do
for your Eleganza Extravaganza?
-I'm the unconventional queen.
I've worked with paper before,
so I'm just going
to wow you guys.
-Well, Chi Chi,
remember what was said
last week.
We want Chi Chi.
Now, we want
an elevated Chi Chi.
We want you to be refined.
We say country,
that's not a bad word.
-Yeah.
-It's flavor.
Savor in it.
-Okay.
-Bask in it.
Never be ashamed of it.
-I'm realizing
that country is in.
<i>So I guess I got</i>
<i>to heighten what I do.</i>
I just want to pull it off.
I want to do good.
-Well, hello there, Bob.
-Hey, RuPaul.
-Now, last week, the judges,
Michelle, specifically,
called you out to see
if you could do glamazon drag.
-I'm gonna go glamorous
for my book look.
So I'm taking this corset.
I've already got
three pieces glued down.
Look at me go.
-Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
-Do a corset
that kind of branches out,
goes past the bosoms.
-Yes.
-Then I'm gonna do
like a gradient color.
-Well, 'cause you know,
Michelle
calls your drag ratchet drag.
-Yeah.
-I am in love with
the way you look tonight.
Less ratchet, more fashion.
-Do you call your drag
ratchet drag?
-I've never called it ratchet,
but that term doesn't offend me.
-Is that a conscious decision?
-It's a conscious decision.
'Cause if you come
to one of my shows,
it's like me
on stage by myself
for an hour and a half.
And if I'm gonna be in, like,
a gown with huge earrings
and big old sculpted up-do,
by the time my show's done,
my eyebrows become my moustache,
I'm sweating.
See what I mean?
So I'm gonna show up
in a leotard.
-You're so confident.
What scares you?
-My mom got sick recently.
She has, like, a chronic
and really rare form
of pneumonia called BOOP,
which sounds cute,
but it's not
that cute, actually.
I got the scariest call,
which is like,
"You need to come here."
I was, like, really freaked out.
-Yeah, yeah.
<i>-My mom had been</i>
<i>very physically fit,</i>
<i>and then she was just,</i>
<i>like, skinny and frail, and,</i>
like, her hair was falling out.
And she couldn't do anything.
Like, anything.
-Wow.
-I mean, it was really hard
to see my mom like that.
<i>[somber music]</i>
All of the things
in my life that,
like, make me a good person are
because my mom
taught me to do it.
I don't have a lot of people
like my mom in my family.
[crying softly]
Fuckin' got me, you bitch.
-Wow.
That's pretty rough.
What do you think your mom
would think about you
in this competition?
-[laughs]
My mom thinks
I'm the best ever.
My mom is the funniest
person I know.
My mom is my hero,
<i>and she showed me</i>
<i>that you can do anything.</i>
More importantly,
come through anything.
-All right.
Well, I want to see
gorgeous Bob The Drag Queen.
-Note taken.
-All right.
Thanks.
-Here we go, girl.
-Hi, Naomi.
-Hi, Ru.
-Now, this is of course
an autobiographical challenge.
-Yes.
-We're looking for your story.
Who are you?
-I'm Naomi Smalls.
-Yeah, that's kind of vague.
I want more.
How are you going to insert
more of you into this challenge?
-My mom is such a huge part
of who I am.
I'm such a huge fan of hers.
-And she had how many kids?
-She had one
in her first marriage,
and my dad had two
in his first marriage,
and they got together
and they had one,
and then eight
of them are adopted.
-And that is...
-That's 12.
-12.
Wow.
-For That's My Mama Realness,
I want to portray
what a classic beauty my mom is.
<i>She doesn't need huge hair</i>
<i>and big diamonds.</i>
She doesn't need anything
to amp her up.
She just knows she's perfect
in my eyes.
-Now, a few weeks ago,
you were almost fading
into the background.
-Right.
-But you came up from behind
and just knocked 'em dead.
-Well, I'm actually
kind of thankful
that I was in the bottom two,
because it literally lit a fire
underneath my ass.
This is what I want to do,
and I should just
fuckin' bring it
every single time.
-Well, you know, two weeks ago,
it was a design challenge
that you won.
-Mm-hmm.
-And I want
that same excitement
from you in this challenge.
-[Naomi Smalls] I'm just
nervous, because the judges
like what I'm doing so far,
and I don't want to give them
any reason to doubt me.
I want to prove to them
that I'm not a one-hit wonder.
-Well, I can't wait to see
what you're going to do.
-Thank you, Ru.
-Get back to work.
-Hi, Kim Chi.
-Hi, Ru.
-You're a design queen.
-Yes, I am.
-So this is something
you can sink your teeth into.
What are you planning?
-With all three of the runways,
it's kind of like
a visual fairy tale.
So I'm going to start off
as a little sprout.
-Uh-huh.
-And through drag,
I blossom into the artist
that I'm going to become.
-Wow.
So, now, this challenge
has a part
that pays homage
to your mother.
What is that gonna look like?
-Oh, my gosh.
So this one I'm really
excited about.
I brought a traditional
Korean hanbok,
<i>because my mother</i>
<i>taught me to be proud</i>
of who I am and my heritage.
-It's something
your mother has worn before?
-Yes.
-Has she seen you in drag?
-She doesn't know
that I do drag.
-What?
-I know.
My mom thinks
I'm a makeup artist.
-You know she's gonna
see this show.
Are you afraid?
-I am a bit afraid
that she might see
all of this as,
like, a waste of time.
I just want my mom
to be able to be proud of,
like, everything that I do.
You know, the person
that I am today.
-You think she doesn't
know that already?
-I don't think so, no.
-Hmm.
<i>[plaintive music]</i>
-Have you never
shown her that side of you?
-Not really,
'cause I just
don't like being
vulnerable with my mom.
-Right.
-'Cause then she might think
that I'm a weak person,
and I want to portray myself
as anything but that.
<i>-[Bob] I think that Kim</i>
<i>should tell her mom.</i>
'Cause I feel like
if you're not really
opening yourself up
to your family,
<i>then you're robbing them</i>
<i>of the experience</i>
of getting to know
and experience you
for who you are.
I mean, in theory, I know Kim
better than her fuckin' mom
knows her.
That's not fair.
-Is that why you got
so emotional on the runway
when you were being critiqued?
-I felt like I tried my best,
but it just didn't work out.
So I just got really frustrated.
-I just felt
like there was a sense of shame
when you broke down.
Somehow they're
all linked together.
I'm not sure how.
And that's what I'm
trying to get at.
<i>-[Kim] I'm very hard on myself</i>
<i>about being perfect.</i>
Especially growing up,
because I wasn't
the model child,
and I was the "artistic" one.
<i>And last week's performance</i>
<i>was a letdown,</i>
because I feel like
my mom probably
wouldn't be proud
of what I did.
-I just want to do really well
in this competition.
-You have done really well.
It's top five.
You are so talented.
Everybody knows that about you.
But do you know it?
-I know it, yeah.
-But do you own it?
-I will own it.
-Will own it?
After this challenge,
or later this--
-No, right now. I will own it.
-Okay.
I need you to really
hear yourself say that,
because that's the key
to this competition.
If you see it,
we can see it, you know?
All right, get back to work.
-Thank you.
-Ladies!
Gather round.
Now, listen,
I've got good news.
Tomorrow on the main stage,
in addition to
David Sedaris,
we will be joined
by his twisted sister...
-[gasps]
-Actress and author
Amy Sedaris will be here.
[cheers and applause]
Oh, right, and there's
one more thing.
In addition
to your three Book Ball looks,
you'll be performing
an opening number.
A tribute
to Amy's comedy classic,
"Strangers With Candy"
in full
Jerri Blank-inspired drag.
[laughter]
-That's gonna be ridiculous.
-So Chi Chi,
you won the mini challenge,
so you're in charge
of the choreography.
-[laughter]
-So good luck,
you boozers, users, and losers.
And don't fuck it up.
-All right.
-Down to production.
<i>-[Chi Chi] For today's</i>
<i>challenge,</i>
we have to come up
with three different looks
for the Book Ball
and a dance number.
<i>It's a tribute</i>
<i>to Jerri Blank,</i>
<i>the character Amy Sedaris</i>
<i>plays on the TV show</i>
<i>"Strangers With Candy."</i>
<i>It's about embodying</i>
<i>this particular character.</i>
-Chi Chi, you don't even
need the teeth in.
-Oh, damn.
-I told y'all she says
shady shit all the time.
-Oh, we can't say things
in jest?
-Let's start from the beginning.
We're gonna have--
[humming]
Got it?
-No.
[laughs]
-Okay, let's do it again.
-Wait. So when I--
I get to the end,
I do it step turn this way?
-[Bob] Why not for this time
you stand behind me,
so you can actually see someone
doing it in front of you?
-Okay, that sounds much better.
[laughs]
-Ready, and--
[humming]
Got it?
-There's the walking.
It's literally,
walk, walk, walk, turn.
-Oh, God.
-Start over.
-Hey, hey,
I've got something to say.
I was a teenage runaway.
Thrown in jail.
Wha--
-So Kim Chi.
-I'm worried that
I might lose this challenge
just because I can't dance,
and I don't want that to happen.
-Come on, let's do it again.
I'ma watch it
this time, guys.
-I was a teenage runaway,
I was a boozer
and a user
and don't forget, a loser!
-Bob can actually dance.
I don't know
why she plays it down
that she's just a comedian.
Girl can dance.
But I don't know how
these other girls are gonna do.
I don't know, girl.
-I was a big fan of the pole.
Also love the hole.
-Naomi, she's still modeling,
she's still voguing,
and oh,
oh, and oh.
She's not kind of channeling
that ugliness of Jerri Blank.
-You're walking like a model.
And I need you to walk
like Jerri Blank.
Yeah, think a hunchback.
-There you go.
-Yeah.
-She has a FUPA.
-Think scoliosis,
like you had in high school.
<i>-[Naomi Smalls] I actually have</i>
<i>no idea</i>
who the fuck is Jerri Blank.
What's "Strangers With Candy"?
Somebody please tell me.
[laughter]
-Think, like, first
of all, do this face,
and then come down and--
[vocalizing]
-Derrick is doing this,
like, weird thing.
She's playing like a fuckin'
caveman almost.
<i>I don't know what</i>
<i>the fuck she's doing.</i>
-This is the sexiest
you've ever looked.
<i>-We down to the top five.</i>
I ain't gonna correct her.
-[sighs]
-Whoo.
-So we're back
in the work room,
<i>and it's crunch time.</i>
-Make it or break it right now.
-We have a short
amount of time,
so it's work, work, work.
[sewing machine whirring]
<i>-I'm nervous</i>
<i>about this challenge.</i>
I'm trying to prove
that I can be glamorous.
<i>But this is not</i>
<i>my field of expertise.</i>
I don't work with unconventional
materials at home.
This is very stressful.
It's a lot of shit.
-Yeah.
-Yeah, there's
just so much to do.
This is, like, crazy.
-For my book drag,
I decided to use cardboard.
Because I want, like,
a really structured dress.
I'm taking
some very bold moves.
I'm not sewing anything.
-Thank God.
-All hot glue and spray paint.
-I mean, well, bitch,
somebody got to go home.
-[chuckling]
Oh, yeah.
-Bob's using more cardboard
than she is books.
<i>That's not the challenge.</i>
<i>Honey, you got it all wrong.</i>
You're in for a rude
awakening, girl.
<i>-[Naomi Smalls] For today's</i>
<i>maxi challenge,</i>
we're getting ready
for the Book Ball.
This challenge is
literally super-important,
because it decides
who makes the top four.
It's a huge deal.
-So, do you guys feel,
like, a lot of pressure
about being top five
and having to perform well?
-I think it would suck
especially to go home right now.
'Cause it's literally
so close you can taste it.
-Do you think you
hands-down deserve to win?
-Yeah.
I think everyone
should have that mentality.
-Agreed.
-Most definitely.
-Why do you think
you deserve to win?
-I've got the best grades
in school.
-But when you look at
RuPaul's beauty and grace,
do you feel
like you possess that,
because I don't see,
in the past winners,
the beauty that they have.
-Damn.
-That bitch
just called you ugly.
-No, no, no.
[laughter]
I've just never heard them
ever say to a previous winner
that they did ratchet drag.
-All the queens
think that I can't be glamorous
because Michelle called me
ratchet one time, in a good way.
And it's all they can cling to,
especially Derrick.
You keep thinking ratchet drag
means something bad.
Ratchet and like, this idea
of somebody being raggedy
are not the same thing.
-But Bob, I've seen,
like, your videos online,
and I think you're very funny,
but, like, the first thing
I thought was, like,
she literally wears lips
and lashes.
-Whoo.
-I guess,
but I mean, I do my thing.
You know, people
will come to my show.
-I just think, like,
makeup is very important
because the moment people
look at you,
that's the first thing you see.
-Yeah.
-I also want to say,
my makeup's
not that fuckin' bad.
-Ooh.
-You guys act like I have,
like, the worst makeup
in "Drag Race" history.
Granted, it's not the best.
I am no makeup artist.
-I don't think
your makeup is terrible,
it just looks like
you're not wearing any.
-It's a bit of a shock,
people thinking
that my makeup is so bad,
'cause no one's ever
read me for my makeup.
-I don't think you even
try to, like,
add more dimensions
with your makeup.
-I do feel, though,
the judges say,
"Oh, I can see you're trying."
-I think the judges
are comparing Bob to himself.
<i>But if you compare Bob</i>
<i>to me and Naomi,</i>
Bob's makeup is nonexistent.
I'm not, you know, like,
putting your talents down.
But I just think, like,
if all people have to see
is, like, your pictures,
to, like, judge you--
-Because there is, like,
a standard with drag.
Especially "Drag Race."
You have to have your makeup
at a certain level.
You have to have your wigs
at a certain level.
<i>-They're absolutely right.</i>
I pay more attention
to my performances
than I do to my makeup.
But what matters is,
are you delivering a product
to people who want to buy it.
That's what matters.
So if your thing is beauty,
then yeah, beauty matters a lot.
But my goal is to be
an entertainer.
And I am an entertainer.
-[Naomi Smalls] I'm not saying
that you should just be
beautiful,
and you should win
because it's a beauty pageant.
But you don't have to be
a fuckin' stand-up comedian,
or just a live singer
or a dancer.
-Why you coming--
why you coming for me, bitch?
-There is definitely
a beauty standard
when it comes to drag.
You could be doing
an amazing death drop,
but it's not gonna be
as impressive
if you look a fuckin'
busted mess.
-My name's Bennett,
and I'm not in it,
but I will say is I do think...
-You in it now, bitch.
-I think you need a talent
to not only win
but to make money in the future.
Like, I'm a dancer.
Everybody knows that I dance.
Everybody knows Bob does--
-Everything.
[laughter]
-Everybody knows.
-Whoo!
-Not makeup.
-I think you need
some kind of talent.
I mean, Naomi,
I look at you as a model.
-Oh!
-And to me,
that's the only that I've--
you know what I mean,
that I've seen.
That's what I get from you.
-Right, I agree.
I think you're
gonna take great photos,
but that does not take talent.
-Being a drag queen
is such a talent.
You are a performer.
You have to be a makeup artist,
you have to be a hairstylist,
you have to be--
-So if you're a hairstylist,
why haven't you glued down
your lace fronts?
-Oh, shit.
The library has opened again.
<i>Insert shady rattlesnake</i>
<i>noise here.</i>
Roo koo-koo-koo-koo-koo-koo-
koo-koo-koo-koo.
-Bitch, glue down your brows,
and then I'll glue down my lace.
-I cannot wait
to see a shot of you
and have screen caps go around,
and it's just lifted lace.
-And you know
what yours is gonna be?
It's gonna be so much light
reflected off that forehead,
because there's
no brow on there.
-[laughs]
I love that you two
can't let it go.
Derrick, you and I are not
frenemies any more.
You two are almost enemies
at this point, girl.
-And I didn't get the challenge
to do my brows
until my last challenge.
-But the judges
told you to do that.
The judges haven't told me
to glue down my wigs yet.
They're telling you
to change up your makeup
and carve out your face.
<i>-Do you not understand</i>
<i>what I do for a living?</i>
I don't carve my face out.
There's no lines on my face.
<i>That's not gonna look</i>
<i>like a female illusion.</i>
That's going to look
like drag makeup.
Not one time
did they tell me
that my makeup is not good.
-And I'm telling you,
like, as a friend,
change up your makeup.
It's not me digging at you.
-There are some digs in there.
[laughs]
-But, Naomi,
why would I change my makeup
when I impersonate
Britney Spears for a living?
-And that's why it bugs me.
Because we're coming
into this competition,
and we're representing
ourselves.
We're not representing
a celebrity.
<i>-[Naomi Smalls] I feel like</i>
<i>I'm telling Derrick</i>
what the judges
have been tiptoeing
around this entire time.
And literally someone just needs
to be blunt about it,
<i>because Derrick</i>
<i>is not understanding it.</i>
And even though Derrick
never really asked me,
but someone needs
to tell him the truth.
Who is Derrick Barry?
Chad came here
with his own aesthetic.
He wasn't doing Cher
the entire time.
-Chad had been doing drag
for years, and--
-And so have you.
-And not impersonating Cher.
-Okay.
Like, when you're coming
to represent you
as a drag queen,
not Britney Spears,
why wouldn't you come
as Derrick Barry?
-Being compared to
Britney Spears in the slightest
is the biggest compliment
in the world.
And if I have to change
my face to be myself,
then I'm not really
being myself.
I just think that you've been
upset with me doing well
in times where you didn't,
so you take digs at me
to make yourself feel better.
-I disagree with Derrick
saying that Naomi goes after him
because she's insecure.
Naomi sees Derrick's skill level
as not being up to par
with everybody else,
and that's why she's frustrated
that Derrick Barry's still here.
-Am I the first person
who's ever
said anything like this,
ever, to you?
-That has said
my makeup is not good?
-I didn't say
your makeup's not good.
It's just not drag.
-These are the most octaves
I've ever heard Naomi speak in,
that's for sure.
You get her excited, girl,
she becomes
Mariah Carey, honey.
-[laughs]
-I just have never said
that you don't belong here,
so for you to say
that I don't belong here--
-I never said
you don't belong here,
it's just that we literally--
-You did.
You said it bugs you
that I'm here.
-No, the thing
that bugs me is
that you are here
finding who you are,
this entire journey.
And we all came here
with our own fuckin' aesthetic.
-Whoo!
-I'm here
in this room with you
right now in the top five.
-Okay.
I'm so annoyed.
[laughs]
[dramatic music]
-When's dinner?
<i>[upbeat music]</i>
[laughter]
-Wow.
-Oh.
-We are getting ready
for the Book Ball.
<i>And we are all feeling</i>
<i>the pressure.</i>
This is the challenge
that is going to determine
who's gonna be
in the top four.
The heat is on.
-Is there anything
about the runway
that you're worried about?
-There's a chance
I might not use the bottom
of my outfit.
You know when you
spray paint something
but it's laying down,
then you lift it up
and things are showing that
weren't showing before?
-Yeah.
-But they want me
to be glamorous,
so I want to wear a gown.
-Short can be glamorous.
Glamorous just
doesn't mean like a mermaid,
like, long silhouette.
-Yeah, but she's like,
full-on glamour.
So I made this mermaid gown.
But it's hard to walk in,
<i>and I think I can be glamorous</i>
<i>without wearing a dress</i>
<i>the size of Kentucky.</i>
This is a risk
I'm willing to take.
-Derrick?
-Hi.
-My mirror's right here.
-I don't feel good about what
happened with Derrick yesterday.
I feel like my mom would've,
like, really, like,
slapped my hand about that.
And I'm gonna do everything
I can to bury the hatchet.
So if he needs a zip-up,
if he needs advice,
if he needs anything,
I will definitely be the one
to give it to him.
-I'm going to powder
and then glue again.
Is that what you do?
-Well, I don't cover my--
-Oh, you don't glue down,
that's right.
-But when it comes down to time
to shape, let me know.
-Yeah.
<i>The judges have asked me,</i>
so for the first time
in this competition,
I am blocking out my brows.
Ooh.
<i>I am going for</i>
<i>three different brow looks.</i>
I just want to show
that I'm comfortable
being a different character
out there.
I want my brow like here,
and then out.
Does that sound right?
-You can start....
[inaudible conversation]
-Okay
[trimmer running]
[inadubile conversation
continues]
-No.
[inadubile conversation
continues]
<i>-I'm proud</i>
<i>that he's trying</i>
to give the judges
something new,
<i>but he only wants to ask me</i>
<i>about his eyebrows,</i>
<i>and changing up your face</i>
is so much more
than just eyebrows.
But I'm giving Derrick space,
because I don't
want him to think
that I'm coming for him
about his makeup.
-What are you doing
for your mom look?
-She wore this blue dress
in our family photo,
and I did a take on that,
but it's more sheer.
-Uh-huh.
What's your relationship like?
-My mom was
great growing up.
She was my best friend.
When I came out to her
when I was 19,
that's when everything changed.
<i>When I came out to my mom,</i>
I thought she would embrace me
with open arms.
And I got the complete
opposite reaction.
The only thing she said was,
"Do you mind
if I keep this under my hat?"
-When she said that,
did you take, like,
super offense?
-I, like, shut down.
I wish I had not told her.
Her opinion changed of me,
and my opinion had changed
of her at that point, you know?
-Damn.
<i>-That's why I have a lot</i>
<i>of empathy for Kim Chi.</i>
Because I know that when a kid
feels broken down
by their parents,
it's something that will always
be in the back of their mind.
And I feel like my mom broke me,
and I just never--
I never got put back together.
-How's your relationship
now with your mom?
-It's better.
My mom has always
been a believer in my talent,
and taught me to shoot
for the stars.
And the worst that can happen
is you land on the moon.
-I love it.
You got a great mom, kid.
[laughter]
Let me see?
Look at me,
straight on.
Relax.
-Like, that is.
[laughter]
That's relaxed.
-Oh my goodness, girl.
Ooh.
That's all I can say is,
"Ooh, my goodness."
[laughter]
-You look so different.
I mean, a completely
different person.
-Really?
<i>-Everyone clowns me</i>
<i>for my makeup skills,</i>
<i>but it's not as bad as Derrick.</i>
It is bad.
I'm seeing tremendous effort
and fearlessness,
and on the other hand,
I'm seeing someone's dad
doing drag for the first time.
Welcome to the stage.
-Really?
-Yeah.
-I feel like I drew
this one higher to offset that.
-Coming to this competition,
I think Derrick should have
practiced covering his brows
at least once,
because perfecting
your drag makeup
takes a long time,
and trying to achieve that,
all of that in two hours?
-Oh, my God.
<i>[music notes burst</i>
<i>dramatically]</i>
<i>["Cover Girl"</i>

<i>And, what?</i>
[applause]
Welcome to the main stage

It's the author of

-AKA, the gay bible.
-And the author

Illiteracy is hilarious.
[laughter]
-And I didn't even

-"Workin' It."
[laughter]
-Work those nails, girl.
-This week,
we challenged our queens
to tell their stories
in three different looks.
But first, they're paying
tribute to the sick
and sickening Jerri Blank.
-[laughs]
-Gentlemen,
start your engines.
And may the best woman win.
[laughter]
[cheers and applause]
-[RuPaul] Let's get
this Book Ball rolling.
Category is Baby Drag Realness.
First up, Kim Chi.
-Big shoes to fill.
<i>-[Kim Chi] On a blazing</i>
<i>August day,</i>
<i>Kim sprouted</i>
<i>from her mother soil,</i>
<i>full of hairy bushes.</i>
<i>And as she was</i>
<i>watered with beauty,</i>
<i>this little flower</i>
<i>began to grow.</i>
-You've got to sissy that walk,
baby Kim Chi.
-The funny thing is that's
how she walks in her real heels.
-[RuPaul] Next up, Naomi Smalls.
-Lady Di-aper.
[laughter]
<i>-[Naomi Smalls]</i>
<i>As a very young boy,</i>
<i>I found a "Vogue" magazine</i>
<i>my mom had on her night table,</i>
<i>and it was high fashion</i>
<i>daydreams from there.</i>
<i>In my head,</i>
<i>I was prancing on a runway</i>
<i>in front of Anna Wintour.</i>
<i>A supermodel was born.</i>
-It Depends.
-But she sure has Poise.
[laughter]
-[RuPaul] Up next, we've got
Bob the Baby Drag Queen.
Why, that's
the biggest pearl necklace
I've ever seen.
<i>-[Bob] When I was just a little</i>
<i>boy, I asked my mother,</i>
<i>"What will I be?</i>
<i>"Am I going to be pretty?</i>
<i>Am I going to be rich?"</i>
<i>And here's what she said to me.</i>
<i>"You'll be a drag queen,</i>
<i>bitch."</i>
[laughter]
-[RuPaul] She's working
that Pebble Flintstones couture.
-[RuPaul] Next, we've got
Derrick Barry.
-[Michelle]
She changed her eyebrows.
<i>-[Derrick Barry]</i>
<i>When I was a little boy,</i>
<i>I would pretend</i>
<i>I was the Little Mermaid</i>
<i>every time I took a bath.</i>
<i>The towels were both my gown</i>
<i>and my hair all in one.</i>
<i>I was a princess in training</i>
<i>to become a queen.</i>
-Seaman lover.
[laughter]
-Yeah.
-[RuPaul] Next, Baby Chi Chi.
<i>-[Chi Chi] My grandmother</i>
<i>would tell my mom, "Girl,</i>
<i>you got something</i>
<i>on your hands,"</i>
<i>especially when she used to</i>
<i>catch me in her fabulous wigs.</i>
<i>Not much has changed now.</i>
<i>My mom still has something big</i>
<i>on her hands.</i>
<i>A big ol' drag queen.</i>
-Not the mama!
Got to love me.
[laughter]
-[RuPaul] Category is
That's My Mama Realness.
Kim Chi.
<i>-[Kim Chi] Kim Chi's mother</i>
<i>determined what she thought</i>
<i>was best.</i>
<i>And that prevented Kim</i>
<i>from blossoming.</i>
<i>However, her mother</i>
<i>had to release her seed</i>
<i>in the wind for Kim</i>
<i>to be the botanical sensation</i>
<i>she always wanted to become.</i>
-A botanical sensation?
-Weed whacker.
-It's a weed whacker, exactly.
-[RuPaul] Naomi Smalls.
<i>-[Naomi Smalls]</i>
<i>My mom, June, wanted nothing</i>
<i>more than to have</i>
<i>a large, happy family,</i>
<i>no matter the ethnicity</i>
<i>or gender.</i>
<i>All 12 of her kids</i>
<i>have their own glam shot</i>
<i>with mother dearest.</i>
<i>I guess that's</i>
<i>where I get my talent</i>
<i>for posing</i>
<i>and love for classic beauty.</i>
<i>Thanks, Mom.</i>
-Christina Darling.
-[RuPaul] Bob the Drag Queen.
<i>-[Bob] Martha Caldwell.</i>
<i>She can make a power suit</i>
<i>from New York &amp;amp; Company</i>
<i>look like Saks Fifth Avenue.</i>
<i>She also sacrificed.</i>
<i>When we would go get</i>
<i>a Happy Meal,</i>
<i>she would give me</i>
<i>her adult-size fries and drink.</i>
<i>And that's what moms do.</i>
-Viola Davis.
Why is your penis
on a dead girl's phone?
[laughter]
-Yes!
-[RuPaul] Derrick Barry.
<i>-[Derrick Barry] I always</i>
<i>imagined that Sally Field</i>
<i>would play my mom, Laura,</i>
<i>in the movie of my life,</i>
<i>because my mom</i>
<i>was just as pretty</i>
<i>as Sally was</i>
<i>in "Steel Magnolias."</i>
<i>My favorite thing my mom wore</i>
<i>was a light blue dress</i>
<i>in our family photo.</i>
<i>I'm reimagining her</i>
<i>in it as a nightgown,</i>
<i>and on the night</i>
<i>I was conceived.</i>
<i>No wonder my dad</i>
<i>hit that baby one more time.</i>
-[RuPaul] Oh, this is the story
of their lives.
-[Michelle] And they have to go
back to move forward.
-[RuPaul] Chi Chi DeVayne.
Ooh, girl.
<i>-[Chi Chi] Pop on those lashes</i>
<i>and slip on them high heels.</i>
<i>That's the motto in which</i>
<i>Albertine lives.</i>
<i>My mama is</i>
<i>the original glamazon.</i>
<i>Miss Tina.</i>
<i>That's what they call her.</i>
<i>And raising three kids</i>
<i>on her own,</i>
<i>she's the definition</i>
<i>of a true baller.</i>
-[RuPaul] Ooh,
miss got the body.
-[Michelle] Yeah. Don't
make me take my rings off.
[laughter]
-[RuPaul] Category is
Autobiographical Eleganza
Extravaganza.
First up, Kim Chi.
<i>-[Kim Chi] Kim Chi has finally</i>
<i>blossomed into the floral</i>
<i>centerpiece,</i>
<i>and now she's not afraid</i>
<i>to showcase who she really is.</i>
<i>Bold and daring, avant-garde</i>
<i>and unpredictable.</i>
<i>Come experience</i>
<i>her ever-blossoming beauty.</i>
-She's a real page-turner.
-She's making it easy
to read her, honey.
-She needs to edit the outfit.
[laughter]
-[RuPaul] Naomi Smalls.
<i>-[Naomi Smalls] As Naomi</i>
<i>Smalls,</i>
<i>I was blessed</i>
<i>with two legs and a heart,</i>
<i>and I'm not afraid</i>
<i>to show them to the world.</i>
<i>What you see now</i>
<i>is the embodiment of everything</i>
<i>I've ever wanted to be.</i>
-Cher.
[laughter]
-I think I see her bookmarks.
-Isn't she filing
for chapter 11?
[laughter]
-[RuPaul] Bob The Drag Queen.
Not to be confused
with Bob The Librarian.
<i>-[Bob] It's not about being</i>
<i>the prettiest</i>
<i>or wearing the best dress.</i>
<i>It's about taking huge risks,</i>
<i>learning from your mistakes,</i>
<i>and taking advice from people</i>
<i>who've done it already.</i>
<i>Look.</i>
<i>I may make waves.</i>
<i>I may rock the boat.</i>
<i>But damn it,</i>
<i>we're gonna make it to shore.</i>
[laughter]
-Hope you like short stories.
-She has a spastic semicolon.
-Is that what that is?
[laughter]
-[RuPaul] Derrick Barry.
-Oh.
-Ooh!
-Oh.
<i>-[Derrick Barry] In 2003,</i>
<i>Halloween brought out</i>
<i>the drag in me.</i>
<i>For the first time,</i>
<i>I dressed as Britney Spears.</i>
<i>It introduced me</i>
<i>to the bright lights</i>
<i>of Las Vegas,</i>
<i>which unleashed</i>
<i>my inner showgirl on stages</i>
<i>all around the world.</i>
<i>Coming to a theater near you.</i>
[laughter]
-That's glossy right there.
-She tore a page from my book.
And she's wearing it.
[laughter]
Several pages.
-[RuPaul] Chi Chi DeVayne.
<i>-[Chi Chi] I'm Chi Chi DeVayne,</i>
<i>and I've always been a queen</i>
<i>who uses what she has,</i>
<i>whether it be paper</i>
<i>or plastic trash bags.</i>
-[laughs]
<i>-So look out, girls,</i>
<i>here comes a little</i>
<i>country queen</i>
<i>with dreams</i>
<i>of ruling the world.</i>
<i>She's guaranteed</i>
<i>to be a best seller.</i>
-Paper shredder.
-Shredding that runway.
-Have you shred
any good books lately?
[laughter]
-[RuPaul] Welcome, ladies.
It's time for
the judges' critiques.
First up, Kim Chi.
-I love your eye makeup.
I'd love to see what
your sink looks like afterwards.
[laughter]
I felt something from each look,
and couldn't wait
for you to come out.
-I think you were the only one
that actually had
a continuing storyline.
It was the artistry
I expect from you.
You've just
outdone yourself tonight.
-Thank you so much.
-Up next, Naomi Smalls.
-With the Jerri Blank,
I don't know how you did it,
but you still were beautiful.
-[laughs]
-Every look tonight,
you were the star of the show.
Looks like you could wear that
on a red carpet.
I love that it's so exaggerated.
To me, that is drag.
-And what a beautiful,
glamorous mother.
I like the story
of having all these children
of different ethnicities,
and still loving each other
and not judging.
-I think that she's such
a beautiful woman to me.
I--I love her so much.
Um, I just hope she's
proud of me, 'cause I love her.
-Do you have a message
you want to say to your mother?
-Thank you for everything
you've ever done.
And I hope I can repay you
for the rest of my life.
I'm sorry.
[sobs]
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you.
Up next, Bob The Drag Queen.
-I thought
in the baby challenge,
you actually looked
like you weren't trying
to be too pretty about it.
You just seemed real to me.
And I thought you did
a great job reading your script.
It sounded really enthusiastic
and flowed really well.
-Tonight I challenged
you to be glamorous.
-Mm-hmm.
-I think that
you're most of the way there.
I think your makeup
looks pretty,
and I think your body's
always on point.
But I am not
getting book at all.
I'm getting cardboard.
-Well,
there is some cardboard in here,
but I don't have
any pages from my book.
-Why not?
-Well, I had this mermaid
bottom that had pages,
but once I finally saw it,
I was like,
mmm, it's a little much.
-But you took off the part
that actually is the challenge.
-Well, I'm still wearing books,
I'm just not wearing pages.
It's a book.
-Okay.
-Don't listen to them.
Yeah, maybe it's not made
out of the pages,
but I like the color,
and I like that it is different,
and it's kind of shingle-like.
You have beautiful legs,
and I love what you did
with your hair.
-I was going to wear a wig,
but I was like, uh.
-Right.
[laughter]
-Yeah.
-Thank you, Bob.
-Thank you.
-All right, up next.
Derrick Barry.
-I have seen what you've done
with your eyebrows.
I acknowledge that you're
trying something different.
But it's going to be
a journey for you.
This, tonight, for me,
I just thought
it was way too plain,
and way too basic.
-But I like that it looks
like you have a real vagina.
-She does.
-Yeah.
-Yeah.
-My mom would be so proud.
-Oh, yeah?
-Derrick, I see you trying
harder than anyone else,
and that I applaud.
But I think
you're getting lost
in what we want.
-Okay.
-We want you to do you
at this level.
And I don't know
that you're at this level.
-[RuPaul] All right, Chi Chi
DeVayne.
-Your dress tonight is really
one of my favorites.
-Thank you, Jesus.
-Each one of these looks
told a story
that made me get
to know you a little bit better,
especially with your mom.
Your mom is giving me
"Real Housewife" of
I hope my neighborhood.
[laughter]
-Real Housewives of Shreveport.
-Yeah.
-Everything that you read,
your voice
just really super sized it.
And I think you have
my favorite line
of the evening,
was that
"I'm just a country girl
with dreams."
[laughter]
You just seemed
really natural and honest,
and I think you did
a great job with that.
-Ooh, thank you.
-I completely disagree.
[laughter]
-Thank you, Chi Chi,
and thank you, ladies.
Now, while you go and curl up
with a good book backstage,
the judges and I
will deliberate.
All right, now,
just between us
best-selling authors,
what do you think?
Kim Chi.
-Kim Chi is a walking
art exhibit.
And tonight there was
so much emotion
with the stories of her mom.
-Who doesn't, by the way,
know that she does drag.
-There was absolutely no joy
when she was her mother.
She conveys a lot to me
by not saying anything.
-Yeah, there's a lot
to read between the lines there.
When she did her voice-over,
the conviction
wasn't quite there.
There's still a tentative thing.
And I think once her mother
gets to meet her,
and they get over
that part of it,
Kim Chi will fully blossom.
Naomi Smalls.
-Miss Underdog 2016.
-Yes.
-I mean, who saw this coming?
I am filled with joy for her.
She's just come full circle,
and at 21 years old,
listening to direction.
-Yes.
-And pushing herself.
-Naomi is checking every box
for me.
She is checking fashion
She is checking glamour.
She is checking performance.
She is checking heartstrings.
Now I find myself
rooting for her.
But is it too late?
-I don't think it's too late.
At least she got there.
-Better late than never.
-It's like a period.
-What's that?
-Something I had
a long time ago.
-[RuPaul] Bob The Drag Queen.
-Bob, I thought,
nailed Jerri Blank.
Out of everybody,
she had the character the best.
What I don't like is the fact
that she wore a cardboard dress,
and books are not made
of corrugated cardboard.
-Don't judge a book
by its cover.
[laughter]
You know, I didn't mind
the dress or the cardboard.
At least he added
some color to it.
And he made me laugh,
just looking at him.
-You can just tell
that he's funny.
The humor kind
of just rolls off of him.
-Derrick Barry.
-I will commend Derrick
on going all the way.
To a different species,
which was--
-Feces?
What'd you say?
[laughter]
You hear what
you want to hear.
-Exactly.
[laughter]
-Uh-huh.
-However, it was just bad,
bad night in general
for Derrick.
She had, like,
two lines for blush,
instead of being contoured
and buffed out.
This is a drag competition.
Come dimensional.
When she reimagined her mother
on a sexy night in a nightgown,
that convoluted story
I can't even put my head around.
This is all a
fuckin' reach, okay?
The thing, you're on stage,
she glued your book to a corset
and put panties on
and she was done.
This was a miss tonight.
I'm sorry.
-Yes, Derrick's wasn't up
to par with the other girls,
but is anyone trying
harder than Derrick?
And that's got
to count for something.
-She's so willing
to receive the critique.
-But this is not the place
to find out who you are.
She's at her limit.
-Chi Chi DeVayne.
-Where Derrick
is getting our critiques
and getting lost in it,
Chi Chi is getting our critiques
and figuring it out.
And it's working.
This is when the horses
are rounding that--
I've never seen a horse race,
but when they go in there right
before they finish, and, like,
one of them sort of,
like, they start to separate?
-Yes, yes.
-This is that moment.
-Seabiscuit.
-Yes. She's--
-Yes.
-And I'm hung up on that horse.
-I thought her writing
was really good,
and I could listen
to hear talk forever.
She's just got such star power.
There's a genuineness
that flows off of her.
-Yes.
-For me, I'm gonna say
probably my favorite.
-Wow.
-Because neck and neck
with Kim Chi,
and what broke it was
the performance of Jerri,
took it over the top for me.
-But Kim Chi's mama drag,
it was so completely
compelling, so mournful
and so closeted, culturally.
And that, to me,
is real acting.
I just--completely
captivated by her.
-All right.
Silence!
I've made my decision.
Bring back my...
[inhales deeply]
Girls.
Chi Chi DeVayne, this week
you shredded the runway.
You're safe.
Kim Chi.
Your botanical garden trilogy
is destined to be a best seller.
Condragulations,
you are the winner
of this week's challenge.
[applause]
-Thank you.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
-You've won a $2,500 gift card
from Fabric Planet.
-Kamsahamnida.
<i>-[Kim Chi] I'm floating in air</i>
<i>right now.</i>
I'm in a cloud with unicorns,
riding through the rainbow.
I could just jump up and down,
'cause I'm so happy.
-[RuPaul] Naomi Smalls.
You're safe.
You may join the other girls.
-Thank you, everybody.
-[RuPaul] Bob The Drag Queen.
Derrick Barry.
I'm sorry, my dears,
but you're both up
for elimination.
-I'm not mad.
I'm like, "You're right."
I get it.
<i>But I'm a little</i>
<i>disappointed in myself.</i>
<i>It's not a fun feeling.</i>
-Mmm.
<i>I feel like I let Ru down.</i>
<i>I do feel like</i>
<i>I'm in good company,</i>
because Bob's
next to me,
and there's no one else
on the bottom
I'd rather see
than Bob right now.
<i>I'm gonna take Bob down.</i>
-Two queens stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me
and save yourself
from elimination.
<i>[dramatic sting]</i>
The time has come
for you to lip-sync
for your life!
Good luck,
and don't fuck it up.
[lively dance music]
<i>-Whoo!</i>
[laughter]
[cheers and applause]
-[RuPaul] Ladies.
I've made my decision.
Bob The Drag Queen,
shantay, you stay.
-Thank you.
I just want to say,
I probably had the biggest butt
of this season
with Derrick Barry,
and I ended up
being her biggest cheerleader
in this competition.
Even if you're afraid
of something,
she does it harder than anyone.
Honestly, I love her.
And I guess that was
the lesson we learned today.
[laughter]
-You may join the other girls.
-[whispers]
You're so brave.
-Derrick Barry, you came here
as a Vegas headliner,
but you leave
an international star.
Stronger than yesterday.
-Thank you so much
for this opportunity.
I'm very proud,
and I'm humbled
by the experience
that you've given me.
And I don't want to cry,
but I'm going to because
that's just who I am.
And I thought for so long
I would just be lost
in Las Vegas,
and now I get to go
all around the world
and represent one
of my favorite icons.
So thank you so much.
-Thank you.
Thank you, Derrick.
Now, sashay away.
[applause]
-Derrick!
-Go, Derrick!
-That's how you go out
in style, girls.
[laughter]
As the international showgirl
of the world!
-Yes!
[laughter and applause]
<i>-[Derrick Barry]</i>
<i>I got to shine as myself.</i>
<i>And that's the one thing</i>
<i>I've always felt</i>
<i>that I was lacking.</i>
<i>I didn't really have</i>
<i>a character or a knowledge</i>
<i>of who I want to be</i>
<i>or who I am.</i>
But I showed up
in this competition,
and I did everything I could.
<i>And that's all that matters.</i>
<i>You have to show up in life.</i>
<i>And I showed up here,</i>
<i>and I made it so far.</i>
<i>And I cannot wait to see</i>
<i>where this takes me now.</i>
So thank you, Ru.
-[RuPaul] My fantastic four,
condragulations.
Remember, you can't
love yourself,
how in the hell you gonna love
somebody else?
Can I get an amen in here?
all: Amen!
-All right,
now let the music play.
<i>["Die Tomorrow"</i>
<i>by RuPaul playing]</i>


<i>Previously</i>
<i>on "RuPaul‘s Drag Race"...</i>
We‘re having a Book Ball.
Ooh.
Am I the first person
who‘s ever said
anything like this,
ever, to you?
That has said my makeup
is not good?
I didn‘t say
your makeup‘s not good.
It‘s just not drag.
<i>[dramatic music]</i>
When‘s dinner?
Bob The Drag Queen.
I am not getting "book"
at all.
I‘m getting "cardboard."
Well,
I‘m still wearing books.
I‘m just not wearing pages.
Okay.
Derrick Barry.
I don‘t know
that you‘re at this level.
I have seen what you‘ve done
with your eyebrows,
but it‘s going to be a journey.
Kim Chi.
I felt something
from each look
<i>and couldn‘t wait</i>
<i>for you to come out.</i>
It was the artistry
I expect from you.
You are the winner
of this week‘s challenge.
Thank you, thank you,
thank you.
Bob The Drag Queen,
shantay, you stay.
Derrick Barry,
sashay away.
Derrick.
[applause]
<i>[upbeat music]</i>
[laughing]
Ooh, my goodness.
All right, girl.
Oh, my God, Derrick‘s message
is actually surprisingly short.
She‘s a champ.
I like her a lot.
I didn‘t think I would like her,
and I ended up
really liking her.
-Yeah, me too.
-I did too.
Long live Britney.
I got to say,
being in the bottom two
-is an experience.
-Mm.
Bottom two,
not a cute look.
<i>I feel like there‘s a dent</i>
<i>in my armor now,</i>
but it‘s time to pick myself up
by my wig straps
and get back in the game.
Congratulations, Kim.
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.
I finally won.
<i>-(Him Chi)I feel really good</i>
<i>about how well I‘ve done,</i>
<i>but I can‘t be too secure,</i>
because people who won
the challenge the week before
have gone home,
<i>so no one is safe.</i>
The judges told me
I have to work on being ugly,
and I don‘t think I know
how to do that.
Can you make an ugly face
right now for us?
Can you smudge your makeup?
Like, just rub your hand
across your...
Okay, ready?
Take the lashes off first.
That‘s too far.
See?
Here I come.
[exclaiming]
Wait a minute now.
[laughing]
There you go.
Be ugly, G.
Top freakin‘...
all: Four.
You know how close we are?
Mad close.
Major.
So now that it‘s the top four,
the stakes are fucking high.
<i>Yes, we‘re all friends,</i>
but unfortunately,
someone has to go home.
This is a competition,
and I want to be
in the top three.
Bring it on.
<i>[car engine starts]</i>
<i>The winner</i>
<i>of "RuPaul‘s Drag Race"</i>
<i>receives a one-year supply</i>
<i>of Anastasia</i>
<i>Beverly Hills cosmetics</i>
<i>and a cash prize</i>
<i>of $100,000.</i>
[all cheering]
-Top four.
-Yes.
<i>It‘s the final challenge,</i>
and Ru told us to show up
in full face
and be ready
to hit the ground running.
Surprise, my top four.
-God.
-Oh.
I didn‘t know you bitches
woke up like this.
I want you to meet
director Jayson Whitmore.
Hello, ladies.
-Hi, Jason.
-Hey, Jason.
Now, Jason has worked
with some of the best
drag queens in the world,
like Alaska,
Adore Delano,
Kim Kardashian...
[laughs]
And now it‘s your turn.
For your final Maxi Challenge,
you‘ll star
in the official music video
for "The Realness."
Yes.
I‘m a video ho.
Goals.
When it comes
to a music video,
<i>it‘s not Kim Chi‘s forte.</i>
I really hope that she can rise
to the challenge.
<i>To not make it</i>
<i>into the top three with Kim...</i>
it would just suck.
Now, Jason‘s vision
includes color,
fashion, mirrors, smoke, drama.
Well, basically, just a day
in your normal life.
[laughs]
Y‘all need to serve
some #Top3Realness,
because the queen
who gets eliminated tomorrow
will be edited out
of the final video
forever.
Yes, forever.
Churl...
<i>I want to be in the top three.</i>
You can‘t be America‘s
next drag superstar
if you‘re not in the video.
So, Jason, I leave my girls‘
charisma, uniqueness,
nerve, and talent
in your capable hands.
Just keep in mind, we don‘t
have a whole lot of time,
so we need to get through
our takes really quick, okay?
Mm-hmm.
Gentlemen,
start your engines,
and may the best woman win.
All right.
It‘s so important to do well
in this challenge,
because this is going to be
the determining factor
if you‘re going to be
America‘s next drag superstar.
<i>[upbeat club music]</i>
Hi.
<i>So now it‘s time to shoot</i>
<i>our first video segment</i>
<i>with Jason.</i>
I love being in front
of the camera,
so I‘m super excited
for our music video.
Ladies, welcome to set.
This setup is going to be
all about float-ography.
You guys are required
to serve up a tight lip sync
while you appear
like you‘re floating on air.
You‘re gonna be playing
to the overhead camera
while you‘re lying
on your backs.
Up first, Naomi Smalls.
I‘m looking for the queens
to feel light and airy.
<i>They have to pay attention</i>
<i>to the fabric</i>
<i>and looking really,</i>
<i>really beautiful</i>
while they‘re floating
back into space.
Float-ography.
Action.
You‘re falling
into this whole fantasy world
that Ru is taking you to.
Give me those legs.
Oh, beautiful.
I want those nice, beautiful,
gorgeous long legs.
Cut, cut, cut.
Naomi, we want to
really watch those legs, okay?
Okay, so, like,
out like this, straight?
But we don‘t want it
to look like you‘re a board,
so use your abs
so it‘s more like this, right?
-Okay.
-So it‘s pretty, okay?
Uh-oh, she got to work out.
<i>-(Naomi)I‘m starting to freak</i>
<i>out,</i>
<i>because my ridiculously</i>
<i>long legs</i>
aren‘t floating,
and I can barely hold myself up.
Manual labor is not my thing.
[laughs]
And action.
Yeah, that pose is perfect.
Keep that pose.
Yes, love that.
All right, and cut.
Great job, Naomi.
It‘s awesome.
Thanks.
[grunts]
Bob, just remember
you‘re floating in air.
I am, like, dangling
off this thing.
And action.
Don‘t put your legs like that.
It‘s not pretty.
Okay.
Ooh.
This shit is not easy.
<i>I am fucking sweating.</i>
I‘m going from looking
like Viola Davis
to looking like Patrick Ewing.
<i>This shit is not cute.</i>
Ooh.
Chi Chi, remember,
you‘re top four.
Lot of energy, face.
Mm-hmm.
[laughing]
And action.
Gorgeous.
Beautiful.
You‘re falling
into the world, yes.
I love that.
Your legs look stunning.
Love ‘em.
<i>Chi Chi is doing great.</i>
I was like, "Fuck you,
you fucking fit
prison trade bitch.
All right, so, Kim Chi,
you better turnt it out.
The hardest part about
this challenge is definitely
moving, period.
Action.
Make sure you look
towards the camera, love.
Find the camera, girl.
All right, cut.
-Hey, Kim Chi?
-Yes?
I‘m getting a lot of chin,
and I‘m not getting
a lot of face,
and I really would love it
to be, like, very graceful,
like you‘re falling
into this whole other world.
-Okay.
-And action.
Give me surprise.
Give me grace.
Kim Chi looks like a fucking
upside-down turtle.
Help.
[chuckling]
Help.
Watch those legs.
<i>I‘m trying to give good face.</i>
Keep the legs moving.
But as the clock ticks on,
it just gets harder and harder
to keep my legs up.
There you go.
What--oh, shit!
<i>[dramatic music]</i>
Oh, shit!
Whoa, is she okay?
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.
Drag queen down.
I‘m fine.
I‘m fine.
<i>Classic Kim Chi.</i>
<i>She‘s fallen more than anyone</i>
in Drag Race history.
Sorry.
Oh, my goodness.
<i>Poor Kim Chi.</i>
I don‘t know, girl.
Your makeup might not save you
on this one.
All right, that‘s a wrap
on the float-ography.
Quick change, and I‘ll meet
you guys back here on the set.
<i>[upbeat techno music]</i>
-Hi.
-Wow, welcome.
Look at you.
<i>-(Chi Chi)It‘s time for our</i>
<i>second take of the video,</i>
<i>and it‘s avant-garde.</i>
I have no idea
what avant-garde is,
but I‘ma do my damnedest.
This is actually going to be
all about you performing.
Avant-garde for the music video
is all about self-expression,
<i>movement, face,</i>
and art.
And action.
More energy.
Okay, cut.
Bob, you‘re at a five.
I want you at a ten.
Can you give me a little bit
more comedy, please?
Okay.
Yes, love that.
[chuckling]
Work it.
Yes.
You did it, girl.
[laughing]
Yeah!
That was great.
All right, Kim Chi, you‘re up.
She‘s so cute.
<i>Kim Chi‘s avant-garde look</i>
<i>is like</i>
Colonel Sanders is about to
cut her head off
and pluck and fry her ass.
She look like a spring chicken.
And action.
Yes.
Ooh, I love that.
With attitude for days, please.
Yes.
Beautiful.
All right, Naomi.
And action.
Yes, mama, work it.
Whoo, sorry.
Okay, cut, cut, cut.
Let‘s do that again, girl.
Come on, Kim Chi.
Who can‘t walk
in heels now, bitch?
Action.
-Yes.
Oh, give me those legs
for days, girl.
<i>Naomi‘s very mesmerizing</i>
<i>to watch.</i>
<i>Like, every pose she strikes</i>
is very perfect.
-Yes.
Paris is burning right now.
Whoo.
Give me Ru fever glam.
Now, that is how you do it.
All right, Chi Chi,
you‘re up next.
And action.
-Yes.
Little bit more dance.
Yeah, love it.
Yes, bitch.
Okay, cut, cut, cut.
Let‘s untangle Chi Chi
from her gown.
-Chi Chi?
-Mm-hmm?
Have you danced
in gowns before?
No.
Okay, well,
we better learn quick.
-Okay.
-And action.
-Bam.
-Bam.
-Ah.
Give me fierce,
fierce avant-garde.
And pose.
Pull your dress up.
Pull your dress up.
-Pull your dress up.
-All right, let‘s cut.
Let‘s cut, cut, cut, cut.
We got a wardrobe
malfunction again.
Again?
Fuck!
Like, I am the dancing diva
<i>of "Drag Race,"</i>
<i>and this frickin‘ gown</i>
<i>it‘s pissing me off.</i>
Okay, cut.
Ladies, we have one more setup.
Go get changed,
and I‘ll see you in a few.
Bob, this is a scene
with your biggest competitor:
you and the mirror.
And action.
-We‘re loving that.
-Serving glamour.
Give me fierce.
[laughs]
Yes.
Bob‘s glamour look
is really interesting.
His right hand looks like
he fisted a coal mine,
and his left hand looks like
he fisted a gold mine.
<i>Yes, work it.</i>
<i>Glamour.</i>
-Fierce.
-Ooh, that‘s cool.
Then you see something
in the mirror.
[chuckling]
Gorg.
Loving it.
We‘re feeling you.
And pose.
Perfect.
And cut.
Okay, we got it.
That‘s a wrap, guys.
That‘s a wrap.
[claps]
<i>What‘s done is done.</i>
<i>Now it‘s up to Ru.</i>
Judge, jury, and executioner.
All right, that‘s a wrap
on "The Realness," ladies.
-It was incredible.
-Excuse me, excuse me.
-Coming through.
-Oh, God.
Coming through.
-Perhaps you can help me.
-Okay.
I‘m here for the photo shoot,
the past winners‘ photo shoot.
[all laughing]
Oh, shit, Tyra,
you look horrible.
[laughing]
And Jinkx got a tan.
And you must be that sweet thing
that won season seven, right?
Whatever--oh, fuck.
This is season eight.
Bye.
Sorry.
Excuse me.
What the fuck?
[laughs]
Damn, bitch, you about
ten episodes late.
Where the fuck you been?
Is there no security
on the goddamn lot?
all: It‘s the last day
of school.
Sign my yearbook, everyone.
<i>It‘s our final day</i>
<i>in the workroom,</i>
and it feels like
it‘s our last day of school,
and we‘re finding out who‘s
gonna get valedictorian
or something.
What do each of you think
you‘ve learned
about yourself
throughout the competition?
I‘ve learned that apparently,
I can come off as very arrogant,
but I attribute it
to confidence.
<i>-(Bob)I‘ve not always been</i>
<i>this confident.</i>
I was like
a little chunky kid.
I was really effeminate.
I had really dark skin,
<i>and kids can be mean to you,</i>
<i>so once I found out</i>
<i>what I was good at</i>
<i>and I really embraced it,</i>
<i>people started to like me.</i>
Find something about you
that you like,
and focus on that.
<i>If I don‘t like my face,</i>
<i>if I don‘t like my skin,</i>
<i>if I don‘t like my weight,</i>
but I think to myself,
"I have nice teeth,"
and it may just start
with one tooth.
"Look at that tooth.
That‘s a nice tooth, man."
<i>And then once you can accept</i>
<i>that little thing</i>
about yourself,
you can just accept you
for who you are.
I‘ve learned
that I can‘t walk in heels.
I can‘t dance,
and I have a lisp.
[laughs]
<i>To be honest,</i>
<i>you could be overweight,</i>
you could have a lisp,
you could have jacked-up teeth,
<i>but you too can turn it around.</i>
You know, people just, like,
like me for who I am
and I shouldn‘t try to be
anybody else.
First impression of Kim Chi,
I thought she was
very talented,
‘cause I already knew of Kim Chi
before I got here,
so I was, like,
already impressed
with her, and...
And then all that changed.
No, but, like, Kim is amazing.
Aww, you‘re amazing.
<i>I was a huge fan of Kim Chi</i>
<i>before I came here,</i>
and now she‘s one
of my best friends here.
She‘s, like, a big,
lovable panda.
I really don‘t know another way
to explain it.
DeVayne.
I--I didn‘t realize
how much I hated
where I was from
and how I talk.
I never, ever thought
I was funny.
Like, I never realized
all of that until I got here.
That‘s why I think you‘ve
grown the most, honestly.
-Yeah.
-This is why.
My journey in this competition
has been up and down.
<i>Making the top three would be</i>
a dream come true.
This means a whole lot to me.
I need to stop comparing
myself to others
and just appreciate what I have,
because what I have is amazing,
and I just need to own it.
I don‘t need to be doing
death drops
and stand-up comedy.
But you know who does
death drops?
Bob.
-[laughter]
-Known for her death drops.
I really did find myself here.
<i>That‘s, like, the best prize,</i>
and I‘m so proud of myself.
<i>[upbeat music]</i>
And probably all of y‘all
I do not want to go home.
I do not want to go home,
either.
I just hate the fucking food
in California.
It‘s gross.
Whole Food and bullshit.
It‘s so good.
Kim, you like all the food
in the world.
-I mean
[laughing]
While y‘all talking about me
eating turkey necks,
this bitch Kim Chi says she eats
fried chicken buttholes.
It‘s good.
I‘m kind of grossed out.
Yeah, that‘s gross, now.
You eat people‘s butthole.
Why is chicken any different?
[all laughing]
Touché, Kimberly.
Touché.
And those motherfuckers
are undercooked!
[all laughing]
[laughing]
Welcome to the main stage
of "RuPaul‘s Drag Race."
Tonight, it‘s just family.
This week, we challenged
our top four queens
to star in the official
music video
of my song, "The Realness,"
and tonight, they‘re ready
to make us gag,
decked out in their
very best drag.
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.
<i>Up first, Bob The Drag Queen.</i>
<i>Not to be confused</i>
<i>with Bob the barista.</i>
No foam.
<i>This is it.</i>
<i>-(Bob)This is the final runway,</i>
<i>so I wanted to wear a tuxedo</i>
<i>and do a feminine version</i>
<i>of it,</i>
<i>so I‘m wearing this crazy,</i>
<i>sequined jacket.</i>
<i>This is quintessential</i>
<i>Bob The Drag Queen.</i>
Tell me about it, stud.
[laughing]
Mrs. PG.
Pass it on.
<i>Up next, Chi Chi DeVayne.</i>
-Miss DeVayne, if you‘re nasty.
-Uh-huh.
Serving opulence.
She owns everything.
<i>-(Chi Chi)I‘m going full-on</i>
<i>pageant.</i>
<i>I have big buns on my head.</i>
<i>To me, it just screams</i>
<i>"best drag."</i>
<i>I‘m trying to show the judges</i>
<i>that I‘ve gotten over</i>
<i>all of these obstacles</i>
<i>that I have gone through,</i>
<i>and I am worthy of this.</i>
Oh, which way are you going?
-[mouthing] That way.
-Oh, that way.
Apparently, she goes
both ways.
Oh!
-Kisses.
-Mm.
If you like it, then you
should‘ve put a bun on it.
Okay, are you ready
for Kim Chi?
I‘m hungry.
Magnificent Maleficent.
-That‘s a cock-a-doodle-doo.
-[laughing]
<i>-(Kim Chi)I‘m wearing a feather</i>
<i>corset</i>
<i>covered in goose</i>
<i>and pheasant feathers,</i>
<i>and I‘m feeling like</i>
<i>a dark, evil princess</i>
<i>who came here to destroy</i>
<i>my competition.</i>
She‘s working that walk,
Michelle.
-She is.
-Mm-hmm.
Only took till the finale.
Well, kimchi gets better
with a little time.
It does;
it‘s--actually,
usually the next day,
it tastes a lot better.
-Yeah.
-[laughing]
"The Raven," Edgar Allan Ho.
Ha ha ha!
Are you ready
for Naomi Smalls?
Ooh, dark lady.
The notorious Twiggy Smalls.
-Uh-huh.
-Yes.
Well, she‘s also serving
a little Kendall Jenner.
She is, yeah.
<i>-(Naomi)I am showing the judges</i>
<i>that I‘m not relying on sequins</i>
<i>and rhinestones</i>
<i>to zhuzh up my outfit.</i>
<i>This is Naomi Smalls glamour</i>
<i>to a T.</i>
<i>I refuse to blend in.</i>
<i>I want to be the star.</i>
The beat goes on,
and so do those legs.
Thanks for Cher-ing.
[as Cher] Yes, gypsies,
tramps, and weaves.
Ladies, here
at "RuPaul‘s Drag Race,"
we have the luxury
of celebrating who we are,
but we must never forget
that even today, there are
little boys and girls
who feel they don‘t fit in.
So I want you to turn back time
and share the wisdom
you have today
with the child you were then.
So Bob The Drag Queen...
-[laughing]
-Aww.
-This is you...
-That is me.
-At four years old.
-Yeah.
What do you have to say
to little Christopher?
I say, "Hey, girl."
I would tell myself, "You‘re
gonna want to change for others.
Do not do that."
I just wanted to be like
my brother or like my uncles.
I was so different than
every other guy in my family.
I just wanted to blend in
and be like them,
but once I realized how
important it really is
to be me,
then I really shone through.
And I would also say,
"Don‘t take out
that student loan
-freshman year of college."
-[laughs]
"Just pay out of pocket
like you did the rest of it,"
because it‘s still haunting me
to this day.
Thank you, Bob.
All right, Chi Chi DeVayne,
this is you at six years old.
What do you have to say
to little Zavion?
I would tell
little Zavion Davenport
that "It doesn‘t matter
where you‘re from
"and how you grew up,
"the neighborhood
you grew up in.
"That has nothing to do
with how far you can go.
"Never be ashamed
of how you walk, talk,
because that is going to be
the key to your success."
Very sweet.
-Thank you, Chi Chi.
-Thank you.
Kim Chi, this is you
at three years old.
Aww.
What do you have to say
to little Sang?
"Hi, Sang,
when you grow up,
"you‘re going to experience
a lot of different cultures.
"People might shame you
for being too different
"and not fitting in
with the rest of the culture.
"At times, you‘re gonna
feel like
"you‘re trapped
in the wrong body,
"and you‘re trapped in a place
where you feel like
[crying] "you can‘t get out,
and you
"at times, you‘re gonna want to
think about harming yourself
"or even running away.
"But I just wanted
to let you know
"that it will all get better,
"and once you grow up,
"the things
that you are ashamed of
are going to be the truth
that other people love you for."
-And...
-It‘s all right, baby.
"And you‘re gonna be able
to embrace them.
"You‘re gonna find a group
of friends who‘s gonna love you.
"You‘re not going to feel
lonely anymore,
"and what you thought
was all just a dream
"will come true for you,
because life will get better."
[crying]
Lovely.
Kim Chi, you didn‘t just
get better.
You got fierce.
"Oh, and go to a dancing class
as soon as possible."
Ha ha!
"You will really regret it
if you don‘t."
[all laughing]
All right, Naomi Smalls.
This is you at seven.
Aww.
What do you have to say
to little Davis?
"Davis, you‘re gonna go
through a really confusing time,
"where people are gonna make fun
of your mannerisms
"and the way that you look,
"but I just want you to know
"that you need to fucking
embrace it,
"because that‘s what
makes you special.
"Be proud that you‘re not like
all the other boys,
"and just do what you do best,
"and that‘s just being you,
‘cause that‘s what people
are gonna love you for."
Thank you, Naomi.
Condragulations, ladies.
Each of you made it
to the top four
the old-fashioned way.
You mother-tucking earned it,
but in very different ways.
Now it‘s time
for the judges‘ critiques.
First up, Bob The Drag Queen.
-You can really dance.
-Thank you.
You come to life
when you use dance moves.
And you had
such great elegance
<i>and length to your body.</i>
<i>You made it look fabulous,</i>
<i>and I was like,</i>
<i>"Wow, Bob The Drag Queen</i>
is giving us some glamour."
Tonight, on the runway,
because we‘ve seen leggings
a lot from you,
I wish it would have just
gone that extra notch
to do a gown.
I was sort of torn
on the leggings,
which, by the way, is what
I would do to those leggings
-if I tried to put ‘em on.
-[laughs]
But I think this is a really
good place for your drag.
Let‘s talk about your journey.
You‘ve managed to do
a really good job
of standing out.
You have managed to be hilarious
throughout,
and you‘ve also listened
to the judges and grown.
I see an evolution with you.
Thank you, Bob.
Thank you.
Up next, Chi Chi DeVayne.
Ooh, girl, you‘ve
come a long way
from Shreveport, Louisiana.
I heard that.
[all laughing]
Tonight, is it
the most creative thing
we‘ve ever seen
on the main stage?
No.
But you look stunning,
and I love the pageant hair.
It‘s one of my favorite things
in the world,
is that pageant hair
with the 18 buns on top.
The music video,
very nice job.
<i>That was, like, your moment</i>
<i>where you were living,</i>
‘cause you were, like,
in the mirror,
and you were all done up,
and it was just you being you.
The wind scene, you looked
gorgeous in that.
<i>Because you dance,</i>
you had the fluidity,
and you knew just what to do
on that black box.
[all laughing]
I have to talk
about some of your journey.
Your taste level was, um,
questionable.
Am I surprised
that you‘re here?
Yes, if I had a time machine
and came here now,
I would be shocked,
but you put in the work,
and I love a surprise ending.
You‘re like the M. Night
Shyama-lama-lan
of drag queens, right?
I didn‘t see this coming.
Our little girl has grown up.
Chi Chi, if I had moisture
left in my body,
I‘d probably
shed a tear tonight.
[all laughing]
But I dried up years ago.
Yes, everybody knows it.
Thank you, Chi Chi.
Up next, Kim Chi.
Even though we fought
this awkward body movement thing
this whole season,
I think you‘ve really
gotten to a place
where you can work it now.
For avant-garde, you were
like a glamorous,
Dame-Edna-inspired chicken.
It was so captivating.
And seeing your journey
of self-acceptance
and your journey
to challenge yourself
has been really impressive.
As a matter of fact,
in your entire journey,
I don‘t think there was one look
that you didn‘t kill,
and tonight is just the cherry
on top of the hot fudge sundae.
Thank you for bringing
your artistry
to the main stage
of "RuPaul‘s Drag Race."
Up next, Naomi Smalls.
You look absolutely
beautiful tonight.
Of course, it‘s iconic Cher
for us,
so it makes us super happy.
-[as Cher]
-Snap out of it.
You have brought it,
<i>and this music video</i>
<i>was no exception.</i>
For avant-garde, I want you
to look like an alien,
<i>and that blue look</i>
<i>with the white boots</i>
<i>gave that to me.</i>
And what I love most about you
is you‘re so sweet.
You‘re that great
combination of, like,
you‘re a fierce bitch that could
cut a bitch on the street,
but you‘re also, like,
a sweet little, like, kitten.
I‘m so happy to see you here,
because I think
you bring something
really special and unique.
You listened, you worked,
and it paid off.
We all have those moments
when you decide to, like,
bust through.
I can think of times
in my career...
it was hearing "No"
when I just said,
"Fuck y‘all.
I‘m in,"
and there was just a moment here
when you just said, "I am in."
Naomi, to say that you
are the surprise...
it‘s no exaggeration.
It‘s just as surprising
as Chi Chi for me.
This is not the final four
that I would have predicted
the first week
in the competition,
and you did it,
and you earned it.
I want to say this
to all the girls.
The theme of the winner‘s circle
is adaptability,
but at the same time
staying true
to your own unique frequency,
and that‘s the truth
not only in this competition
but in everything in life.
Taking those cues
from the universe
and applying them
but without losing who you are,
and each of you represent that,
and I am so proud
of each of you,
and that is why you‘re standing
on this stage today.
All right, ladies.
Final question.
Why should you,
and not your competitors,
be crowned America‘s
next drag superstar?
<i>[dramatic music]</i>
Bob The Drag Queen.
I have, statistically,
done the best
in this competition,
and you reward the person
who has done the best
with the highest reward.
I don‘t just do what I do
for me.
I literally do it
for anyone who can come
within range
of my obnoxious, raspy voice.
I serve the people.
I serve the community,
and more than just
doing stand-up comedy,
and actually getting
my hands and feet
into the dirt of the community
and helping it grow,
because the community
has helped me grow,
and it‘s made me who I am today.
Thank you.
All right, Chi Chi DeVayne.
I should be America‘s
next drag superstar
because I feel like I possess
the talent,
the willingness to grow,
the willingness to take
your critiques
and apply ‘em.
I can be funny just as well.
I can make costumes,
and I can beat this mug out too.
I can work a runway.
I can work a music video,
and I‘ve just blossomed,
and I feel like...
that I should be
America‘s next drag superstar,
because I‘ve shown
the most growth
out of--out of all
of these girls.
Thank you.
All right, next.
Kim Chi.
Throughout this
whole competition,
I have shown consistent
and creative and detailed looks.
I have been professional
and courteous
throughout this whole
experience.
I have been willing to adapt
to myself
in any situation I am in.
None of the girls will ever come
up with the stuff that I do.
I don‘t want to be America‘s
next drag superstar.
I am America‘s
next drag superstar.
-Thank you.
-Thank you.
All right, Naomi Smalls.
I love drag so much.
It is what, like, gets me up
in the morning,
and I have such a need
and a want to grow,
and I don‘t like
to pigeonhole myself
into just being either
a stand-up comedian
or a dancing queen
or a look queen.
I want to be able to do anything
and show everybody
that I can be successful
just being me
and loving who I am,
and that is everything
I want in the world.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Well, my queens,
I think we‘ve heard enough.
While you untuck backstage,
the judges and I
will deliberate.
Now, just between us
squirrel friends,
what do you think?
Now, y‘all were doing
a lot of praising up there,
and these kids have come
a long way.
I understand that,
but I need y‘all to get real
for the realness.
-You know what I‘m saying?
-I can get real.
-I‘ll break it down.
-You know?
‘Cause, hey, this is still
a competition,
and somebody
has to go home tonight.
<i>Bob The Drag Queen.</i>
Spandex leggings...
not so much for best drag.
I would have loved
to have seen a gown.
The makeup has always been
-not great.
-Right.
There was some growth
with the looks,
but, you know, if I‘m buying
a ticket to Bob‘s show,
it‘s not to see glamour.
It‘s to be entertained.
She‘s been consistently smart
with her humor.
-The Snatch Game was stellar.
-Oh.
I also liked
the shady politics ad.
I thought that was really funny.
I think my number one
Bob moment
was "chocolate chip cookie."
Shut it down in the acting.
Really every challenge,
Bob rose to the occasion
and was able to inject
Bob The Drag Queen
into that challenge.
<i>Chi Chi DeVayne.</i>
Look at how far she‘s come.
She had to lip-sync
for her life twice,
and she not only saved herself,
she, like, killed it.
Like, we had
a "come to Jesus" meeting
during "I‘m Telling You
I‘m Not Going."
The Bitch Perfect challenge.
That was a high point.
She was upside down,
lip-syncing.
-Uh-huh.
-Twerking.
-Yes.
-I mean, come on.
<i>Also, the Book Ball</i>
<i>was a shining,</i>
glorious moment
for Chi Chi DeVayne.
<i>As great as she looked,</i>
looking at the four queens
on that stage today,
I didn‘t know
if she‘s as original
as the other ones, you know?
-Chi Chi I‘ve seen done before.
-Mm-hmm.
-But I‘m in love with Chi Chi.
-Right.
As a judge, I don‘t know
what to do with that.
She is one of the kids
who come from the sort of
backwoods of drag.
She doesn‘t have to do
the outfits
that people in big cities
come to expect,
but in this competition,
judges wanted to see more,
and she delivered more.
<i>Kim Chi.</i>
She can definitely
serve a look
better than nobody‘s business.
I loved the Wonderful
<i>-Wizard of Oz challenge.</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>
<i>And what she did with the</i>
<i>stripes, with the little woman,</i>
I thought it was really,
really smart.
When she did the Book Ball
<i>and created the paper wig</i>
<i>out of pink pieces of paper,</i>
it‘s phenomenal.
My favorite moment
with Kim Chi
was the first time I saw her,
and I thought, "What in the hell
am I looking at?"
The interesting thing for me
was watching the struggle
of not loving
who she is in her skin.
I kind of went through
a very similar thing
when I did "Queer Eye."
It was like that thing
that I was hiding.
It was like, "Oh, my God,
you‘re the queer guy?"
Then it was, like, celebrated,
and you‘re like,
"Wait a minute."
I think that‘s gonna happen
with her owning it
and saying,
"Wait, I‘m being celebrated
for who I am,
lisp and awkwardness,"
and she will get there,
but does she have the ability
to command a stage
and work a crowd?
I don‘t know.
She has the capability
-to change drag a little.
-Mm-hmm.
-You know what I mean?
-Yes.
To really sort of shift it
in a very new,
-2000-something...
-Yes.
Sort of way,
and I‘m curious to see
where it goes.
<i>All right, let‘s move on</i>
<i>to Naomi Smalls.</i>
She has upped her game,
and she has brought it to us
on a different level.
The Wizard of Oz moment
<i>was such a game changer.</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>
<i>-My God.</i>
That was really
the turning point for her.
-I mean, haute couture.
-Yeah.
High-end fashion.
Now, in the video,
I really loved
-her avant-garde look.
-Mm-hmm.
<i>I love that she knows</i>
<i>her brand.</i>
I think the turning point
for me
was in the black-and-white movie
runway look,
<i>and she did that beautiful</i>
<i>gray makeup.</i>
And then out she comes
in the Book Ball
<i>in that paper dress,</i>
<i>which was straight off</i>
<i>of a runway somewhere.</i>
Her POV became OMG.
-[laughing]
-For me.
LOL.
She‘s one that
in a year or two
will be killing it,
but I think she‘s just
not there yet.
I don‘t believe that at all.
-Really?
-We can all get better.
But compared
to the other girls
at this point in time,
-I don‘t think she‘s there yet.
-I do.
Her drag is really good
and polished.
And she‘s fashion.
She‘s posing,
which gives me the chills
every time she does that thing
that I wish I could do,
but my belly gets in the way.
I--guess what I‘m about to say?
-I agree with Michelle.
-[exclaims]
-What?
-I know, I know.
I know, but I...
I think what she did this season
is worthy of being
in the top three
and maybe even taking the crown.
well, I‘ve just got to say
for the room, you know,
you guys have been
no help whatsoever.
[all laughing]
Silence!
I‘ve made my decision.
Bring back my girlssssssss...
<i>[dramatic notes]</i>
Ladies, before I can decide
who makes it to the top three,
there‘s just one more thing.
This is your last chance
to impress me
and save yourself...
from elimination.
<i>[dramatic music]</i>
The time has come...
For you to lip-sync...
For your life.
Good luck,
and don‘t fuck it up.
<i>[techno music]</i>
<i>-(Naomi)Drag is about</i>
<i>pushing boundaries</i>
<i>and pushing yourself.</i>
<i>This is what I love doing,</i>
<i>and I just want to do this</i>
<i>for the rest of my life.</i>
<i>I should go forward</i>
<i>into the top three</i>
<i>because I‘m a performer.</i>
<i>I‘m a supermodel.</i>
I‘m a fucking drag queen.
<i>-(Chi Chi)I am the dancing</i>
<i>queen of this season,</i>
<i>and I have that country swing.</i>
<i>I can act.</i>
<i>I can do comedy.</i>
<i>I‘m ready for it.</i>
I am America‘s
next drag superstar.
<i>Making it into the top three</i>
<i>would mean the world to me,</i>
<i>-(Kim Chi)because I am proving</i>
<i>to myself,</i>
<i>to the world, and my mother</i>
<i>that all the work</i>
<i>and all the crazy stuff</i>
<i>I‘ve been doing</i>
<i>for all these years</i>
<i>has not been a waste.</i>
I have never, ever
wanted anything more.
<i>I want this so bad it hurts.</i>
I am living my dream.
<i>-(Bob)I actually got into drag</i>
<i>because of "Drag Race."</i>
<i>I‘m a "Drag Race" baby boom.</i>
<i>Right after season one,</i>
<i>I started doing drag,</i>
<i>so this is important.</i>
<i>I came here to show America</i>
<i>why I think</i>
<i>I‘m one of the best drag queens</i>
<i>in the land.</i>
I need to make top three.
Like, I have to.
[laughing]
[cheers and applause]
-Oh, my God.
-God.
-Yay.
-It‘s the last day of school.
Yeah.
Ladies,
I‘ve made my decision.
<i>[dramatic music]</i>
Chi Chi DeVayne.
I‘m sorry, my dear,
but you will not be moving on
to the top three.
Chi Chi, you used
your Louisiana glamour
to charm the world.
Take what you‘ve learned here
and let them have it.
I just want to thank
each and every one of you
from the bottom of my heart.
Not only have you guys taught me
how to be a better entertainer,
but you have taught me
how to be a better person,
and $100,000 cannot buy that.
Thank you, Chi Chi.
Now, sashay away.
<i>It‘s a knife in the heart,</i>
<i>the back, the ass.</i>
<i>It‘s a hurting feeling,</i>
to know that you‘ve
put your all and...
it didn‘t pay off.
I‘ve learned how to love me,
my country accent,
<i>so I‘m happy, but I‘m sad</i>
<i>at the same time</i>
<i>that I didn‘t win the crown.</i>
All right, world.
Meet your top three queens.
Who do you think should be
America‘s next drag superstar?
Are you #TeamBob,
#TeamKimChi,
or #TeamNaomi?
I want to hear from you.
Sound off across
all social media,
@RuPaulsDragRace,
#DragRace.
Tweet it.
Comment on Facebook.
Blow up Instagram.
Call your mother.
Hire a skywriter.
Leave a lipstick message
in the restroom at work.
I don‘t care,
just do it now,
and tune in two weeks
from tonight
to watch the grand finale
of "RuPaul‘s Drag Race,"
where I will crown a winner.
Can I get an amen up in here?
all: Amen.
All right, now,
let the music play.
<i>[shimmering chimes]</i>





<i>Previously on</i>
<i>"RuPaul's Drag Race"...</i>
This is the 100th episode
of "RuPaul's Drag Race."
-[all] Yes!
-Whoo!
-Oh, my God.
-So I've arranged a photo shoot
with some extra
special guest stars.
[laughing]
Pose the house down.
You remind me of a dog trying
to get comfortable on the couch.
Oh, my God.
Each of you will be assigned
a legendary design challenge
<i>from a past season.</i>
[fabric rips]
[gasps]
My fucking
panties just ripped.
Shit.
Acid Betty.
Every inch was kind
of covered with a thought.
To me that's what drag is about.
Naysha Lopez.
I just don't think
it looks good.
I don't really sew.
Kim Chi.
You were giving me, like,
this Cowardly Lion
ferociousness.
I like that you kept
your areolas bald.
The breasts are the windows
to the soul for sure.
Laila McQueen.
I felt like the bottom half
was just a cop-out.
Do you think
that your missteps
would warrant you in the bottom?
I don't think that
I am the least put together.
Who do you think
is the least put together?
Naomi.
Her look is very plain.
Do you agree with that, Naomi?
No.
Kim Chi, condragulations.
You're the winner
of this week's challenge.
Yeah, girl.
Laila McQueen,
shantay, you stay.
Naysha Lopez, sashay away.
-Girl.
-Whoo.
Oh, my gosh.
Aww.
<i>-[Robbie] The first message</i>
<i>in lipstick on a mirror.</i>
Holy fuck.
Too real.
"It was a pleasure
meeting you all.
Play the cards you are..."
-[both] "Dealt
and turn da party."
-Aww.
-Cutie.
I'm sad to see her go.
She had such a nice butt.
I'm gonna miss my sister
a lot, so te amo, mamita.
<i>For me it's shocking</i>
<i>that Naysha</i>
left this competition
too sooner
<i>-[Cynthia] because I know</i>
<i>she can offer a lot more.</i>
I got to say,
when you hear the words
"lip-synch for your life"
in person,
-it's not fucking funny.
-It sucked.
Hearing the judges' critiques,
I definitely need to do more
to stand out.
Wipe her away, girl.
Shit's getting real.
Back at home I'm more of the,
like, edgier girl,
<i>-[Tyler] but, like, seeing</i>
<i>people like Thorgy, Acid Betty,</i>
<i>and Kim Chi,</i>
<i>it's like, "Okay,</i>
"I am no longer the big fish
in a small pond.
Bitch, you need to, like,
step it up."
So, Laila,
were you gagged
that I was not
in the bottom two?
I had to say something.
<i>To be honest,</i>
<i>I do not think</i>
that a lot of the girls
really deserved to be safe.
<i>Naomi's boat</i>
<i>looked like shit.</i>
<i>Cynthia's outfit</i>
<i>was a knockoff pink version</i>
<i>of Detox's from her season,</i>
<i>and Miss Derrick Barry--</i>
<i>girl, the first episode,</i>
a bikini, really?
It was so hard to read.
Between you, me, her,
and Naysha, I was like,
"I honestly have no idea
who they're gonna pick."
I don't blame Laila
for being salty
about being in the bottom two.
<i>-[Naomi] I think she's feeling</i>
<i>like she's really blending in.</i>
Everyone wants to meet the star,
not the entourage,
and right now
Laila's just giving entourage.
Oh.
<i>The winner</i>
<i>of "RuPaul's Drag Race"</i>
<i>receives a one year supply</i>
<i>of Anastasia</i>
<i>Beverly Hills cosmetics</i>
<i>and a cash prize of $100,000.</i>
<i>With extra special</i>
<i>guest judges</i>
<i>Jamal Sims,</i>
<i>Lucian Piane,</i>
<i>and "Pitch Perfect"'s</i>
<i>Ester Dean.</i>
<i>[upbeat music]</i>
-Good luck.
-Good morning.
Walk into the room
purse first. Clack.
<i>-[Thorgy] We've all survived</i>
<i>the first elimination.</i>
The race has finally begun.
-Bye, Naysha.
-There goes the prettiest one.
She was beautiful.
Emphasis on "was."
Who's the next prettiest?
I know Britney
wants to think she is.
Why can't I know I am?
-[all] Ooh!
-Girl.
She done already had her.
[siren wails]
Ooh, girl,
<i>-[Bob] she done already done</i>
<i>had herses.</i>
<i>Hey, bitches.</i>
-[all] Hey.
<i>True or falsetto:</i>
<i>America's next drag superstar</i>
<i>needs to strike a chord</i>
<i>in the key of,</i>
<i>"Gee, your drag</i>
<i>sounds terrific."</i>
<i>Otherwise,</i>
<i>you're gonna fall flat,</i>
<i>and I ain't just preaching</i>
<i>to the choir, okurr?</i>
Yes, work.
-Whoo.
-Hello, hello, hello.
[cheering]
-Yay!
-Whoo!
Now, ladies,
who likes to dance?
[cheering]
Good, because for
today's mini challenge
we're having
a Latin style dance off.
Yes.
<i>Escándalo.</i>
I want to see you swing
those hips to a song
by AB Soto featuring me,
"Cha Cha Bitch."
Yes.
Hola, Pit Crew.
[all] Whoo!
Delicioso.
The Pit Crew
is delivering clothes
provided by Out of the Closet
Thrift Store,
benefiting the AIDS Healthcare
Foundation since 1990.
Oh, awesome.
So grab your cha-cha heels,
get into quick drag,
and meet me on the dance floor.
-Go.
-Go.
Anyone need a mother
of the bride outfit?
I love it.
Someone should be doing J. Lo
and just ass out.
Actually, Spanish women
don't shave their legs, right,
so my hairy legs are good?
Back home in Brooklyn,
Thorgy is well-known
<i>-[Acid] for her alternative</i>
<i>kind of style,</i>
and it's a hairy style,
to say the least.
You know what?
I don't think I need to--
I don't want to wear tights.
All right, kids,
time's up.
Señoritas, look who's here
to help me judge
the "Cha Cha Bitch" fight.
Say hello to AB Soto.
-[all] Whoo!
-Oh, my God.
So, AB, any words
of advice for my chicas?
Yes, give me reina,
give me perra,
and work your cha cha, bitch.
[laughs] Acid Betty,
you're first.
Ready, set,
cha cha, bitch.
<i>[laughing]</i>
<i>Ain't no party</i>
<i>like a cha cha party</i>
<i>'cause a cha cha party</i>
<i>goes ah!</i>
-Yeah!
-Whoo!
-Whoo!
-Ow!
Derrick Barry.
Yes, honey,
we are serving taco Tuesday.
Cynthia Lee Fontaine.
The cha-cha heels
are alive.
Whoo!
Bob The Drag Queen.
Whoo!
Yes, ma'am.
Dax ExclamantionPoint.
Naomi Smalls.
[laughs]
Laila McQueen.
Señorita Robbie Turner.
Chi Chi DeVayne.
[cheering]
Take that, Donald Trump.
Kim Chi.
<i>[record scratches]</i>
This is sad.
Kim Chi has two left feet
and vertigo.
Work!
Thorgy Thor.
[laughs]
<i>Cha cha, bitch.</i>
[laughing]
[cheering]
Oh, my goodness.
I'ma call immigration on y'all.
Ladies, we'll be posting
all of your best "Cha Cha Bitch"
moves at LogoTV.com,
and I just got to say,
Thorgy Thor,
special shout-out for serving
Frida Kahlo realness.
Oh, thank you.
Now, ladies, two of you were
the baddest bitches of all.
The winners are...
Cynthia Lee Fontaine...
[cheering]
And Chi Chi DeVayne.
[cheering]
Let's give a big "Drag Race"
thank you to AB Soto.
-[all] Whoo!
Now, cha cha, bitch.
Ladies, I'm glad
you're all warmed up
because this week's
maxi challenge
is an all dancing,
all lip-synching extravaganza.
-[all] Whoo!
<i>-[Kim] Choreography?</i>
Mm-mm.
You'll be competing
in two teams
in the dragappella movie
"Bitch Perfect."
[cheering]
#BitchPerfect, okay?
Plus you'll be meeting
with a choreographer
who's worked with Miley,
Madonna, and J. Lo, honey.
-The red hot Jamal Sims.
-Whoo!
Cynthia and Chi Chi,
you won the mini challenge,
so you are team captains.
Cynthia, your group
is the Lady Bitches,
the sweethearts of dragapella
from the prestigious
Lace Front Institute
of Technology, darling.
[laughter]
Chi Chi, your group
is Shady Bitches.
Y'all the bad girls
from the Lake Titicaca Academy
of Braids, Weaves,
and Waffles.
[laughter]
All right, ladies,
it's time to pick teams.
Cynthia, who will you
choose first?
-Bob The Drag Queen.
-All right, all right.
Chi Chi, you're next.
Acid Betty.
It don't get
shadier than this.
Derrick Barry.
Oh, thank God
I did not get picked last.
-Thorgy Thor.
-Whoo!
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yow.
-Laila.
-Laila.
[laughter]
Let's go with
Dax ExclamationPoint.
Yay, my turn.
Robbie.
That means that Kim Chi
and Naomi Smalls are left.
Sorry, Kim, but I'm gonna
have to go with Naomi.
Which of course means that
Kim Chi goes to Cynthia's team.
Wah.
<i>It's okay.</i>
I wouldn't want me either.
Ladies, this week
you've got to use
your charisma,
uniqueness, nerve,
and talent
to chorally gratify
me and the judges.
Gentlemen,
start your engines,
and may the best woman win.
[cheering]
<i>-[Derrick] Oh, my God.</i>
<i>Kim Chi's a horrible dancer.</i>
She's so bad.
How is she gonna get
through this dance challenge?
So, girls, like,
we're gonna, like,
take one, pass it down.
The pressure of being
a team captain,
it--it can be a lot,
but I've done choreography
for the girls back at home.
I got this.
I think we should
get some choreography together.
Let's just worry about that
when in time comes.
Don't--don't confuse yourself.
We need to know
where you come in first.
I think after this
we should
put something
together just in case.
-Don't get scared.
-I'm not scared.
-I'm just trying to be prepared.
-I know, but--
I'm not gonna be unprepared
because of you, boo.
I can sense that Acid
definitely wants
to be the group leader,
but it ain't happening.
We need to learn
where we come in first.
Fine, but we got to
start doing something.
We can't just sit here
sitting here learning words.
<i>I've known Betty for,</i>
<i>like, ten years,</i>
and sometimes because Betty
is so artistic,
she gets away with
being a fucking asshole.
Let's go from the beginning.
"Oh, really,
is that all you got?
What about this?"
Is that what
you're gonna be doing?
"Lake, Lake,
Titi, Titi, Titi."
-Yeah.
-No, you're gonna be out there.
-But the rest--
-Whatever.
Well, we should probably
set it instead of "whatever."
Let's get beyond "whatever."
Okay.
<i>-[Thor] Acid Betty is an</i>
<i>asshole,</i>
<i>and she knows it,</i>
<i>and she loves it,</i>
and that's why she doesn't
work in New York.
<i>She's so demanding</i>
<i>and mean to everyone</i>
<i>that nobody wants</i>
<i>to work with her.</i>
You're gonna be shamed.
You're gonna be put down,
so, Chi Chi, good luck.
Formations, formations.
One, two, three, four.
I like that roll back
and sit in the hip.
-Yeah.
-That's cool.
This week's maxi challenge is
an a cappella lip-sync battle.
<i>-[Derrick] Oh, my gosh,</i>
<i>we have to lip-synch.</i>
<i>We have to dance.</i>
Basically we're putting out
"Bitch Perfect."
Here we go, and pat,
pat, pat-pat-pat.
Let me see y'all do it.
-Boom, boom.
-Bam, bam, bam, bam.
Uh-uh, y'all look like
flailing fishes.
Well, "pat, pat,
pat-pat-pat,
"pat, pat, pat-pat-pat"
was the original rhythm.
No, ma'am.
It's pat, pat, pat-pat-pat,
pat, pat, pat-pat-pat.
Switch it
to something simpler.
That's so simple too.
I can't even get any simpler.
<i>-[Chi Chi] I picked my team</i>
<i>based off the mini challenge,</i>
but girl,
these girls cannot dance.
Boom, boom.
Wait, we're now--
we're robot-ing.
Okay, simple.
One, two, three, four,
turn and down, down.
It look crazy.
I'm just trying to fucking
get your visual in my head
so I can have it.
-Do it, bitch, do it.
-Three, four, five, six, seven.
-That's it.
-One, two, three, four, five.
No, five, six, seven,
eight is just a turn.
Don't move on five, six,
seven, eight at all.
We should change it if
you can't get it.
What the eff?
It's simple.
One, two, three, four, turn.
One, two,
three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.
-Is that--
-Got it.
The hands weren't the same,
but fuck it.
We got to move on.
You ready?
I don't know.
We're doing it.
It's happening.
All right, girl.
Can you just give me a shot,
and I'll flip out?
I'll do the second one.
And I'll punch you
in the face--boom!
See, you trying to get
out of the choreography.
-Bitch, you trying to do comedy.
-I can do all of it.
If we're standing there,
"One shot,"
five beats of silence,
it's boring.
I don't want you to do
that punch thing.
I just want you to, like--
Okay.
Chi Chi does not get funny,
<i>and I'm, like, a comedy queen,</i>
<i>so I'm like,</i>
<i>"Okay, you know what?</i>
I'm gonna do it anyway.
I don't care, bitch,
it'd be funny."
All right,
so shall we move on
and do it again,
or do you want to stand here?
We'll get it.
<i>Oh, my God.</i>
<i>These bitches getting</i>
<i>on my nerves.</i>
They getting on my nerves now.
All right, Lady Bitches,
are you ready?
Kim, I feel like you're
the one who is kind of,
like, nerdy and not cool.
Yeah.
-Regina George.
-I'm the ringleader.
I think you should be,
like, her kid sister.
You do exactly
whatever she does,
just not as good
as she does it.
Aw, Laila's my impersonator.
-That's cute.
-Yeah.
My biggest concern
is that I'm gonna
fade into the background
comparatively
<i>to all the other girls,</i>
<i>so I'm not sure</i>
<i>about playing the,</i>
like, little sister, like,
wannabe Derrick Barry,
'cause I probably wouldn't be
the best Britney impersonator.
Look at this
giant fucking heel.
-Yeah.
-Those are so cute.
Bitch, I hope y'all can dance
in them high-ass heels.
You need something
this size, hon.
-That's like a--four inches.
-No, ma'am.
Have you ever, guys,
been in proper shows before
where you have to learn
choreography and stuff?
When I was a kid, yes.
Like, for years.
Just--oh,
when you were younger.
So you don't really
know how to, like,
just focus
and get it done?
Yeah, I do.
'Cause we're
talking about shoes.
I would love to,
like, save the time
and figure out
what we're doing.
This is how
the group's gonna down.
"So what'd you guys do?"
"Well, we spent time talking
about how comfortable
these shoes were."
-We're not going down.
-No.
My worry with this group
is that I might be the only
one that's gonna give it
and the other girls are just
gonna take me down with them.
<i>Chi Chi needs to step up</i>
<i>and get us together.</i>
So we all know our lip syncs
somewhat? Like, the words?
-Ish.
-Mm-hmm.
I think that's gonna be
the most important part
so when we meet the
choreographer
we can kind of just take
in what he's saying.
You're, like,
looking at me like
I'm Charlie Brown's teacher.
Wah, wah, wah, wah,
wah, wah, wah.
Wah, wah, wah,
wah, wah, wah, wah.
-You're done?
-No, I'm not done.
Definitely not done.
I just want to be good.
My biggest fear
in this challenge
<i>is these girls flopping</i>
and me having
to take the fall
for my whole team.
Hey, kitty girls.
-Hey, Ru.
-[all] Hi!
How are my
little treble makers?
-We're working it out.
-Yeah.
-Cynthia Lee.
-Hi, RuPaul.
What's the name of your group?
My name
of my group is--
You've got to look at a paper
to get the name of your group?
-Lady Bitches.
-Yes, ma'am.
So what--
did you have a strategy
in choosing these ladies?
Actually, yes,
'cause I got dancers.
I got the comedians one,
the actors, makeup artists.
Now, Kim Chi,
this is a lip-sync challenge.
Are you a lip-sync artist?
I think I am,
but my biggest problem
is sometimes when I lip-synch
my lisp comes through.
-I'm not mad at a lisp.
-Yeah.
In fact,
I'm partial to a lisp.
My empire was built on a lisp.
-Really.
-Absolutely.
Are you familiar with
the movie "Pitch Perfect?"
I've never heard of it
or even know what it's about.
I was probably in Korea
at the time.
Well, it just came out, uh,
six months ago.
[laughter]
<i>Oh, my God.</i>
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi.
So now, Laila,
why do you think you wound up
in the bottom two?
Well,
the photo with Mathu
<i>was definitely</i>
<i>less than amazing.</i>
Right, because, you know,
you were scrunched over.
You weren't shining through.
How are you gonna shine through
in this challenge?
I ain't gonna
be squatting down
and sitting in the back.
I'm gonna come forward
and be present.
Well, you know,
a lot of girls say that.
There's more strategy
to it than that.
-You realize that?
-Yes, ma'am.
<i>I get it.</i>
<i>I need to bring myself up</i>
<i>to the level</i>
<i>of the other girls</i>
so I can be like,
"I'm here too."
It's not just them.
I am here.
Listen, I am
so excited for this,
and we're gonna see
the real crème de la crème
rise to the top, all right?
Oh, she's coming back?
She's coming back.
All right, get to work.
-Thank you.
-All right.
-Thanks, lady.
-Whoo.
Well, all right, now.
-Hey.
-Hi, Ru.
-Hi, Ru.
-Are y'all the Shady Bitches?
Yes, we are.
Are there any shady bitches
in this group?
Oh, okay, well,
there you have it.
Now, Chi Chi,
you from Louisiana.
Louisiana, baby.
You know, both my parents
are from Louisiana.
Yes, I enjoy being
a country queen.
I mean, who doesn't like
an old smoked turkey neck, baby?
[laughter]
Now, Chi Chi,
you're the leader.
How are you navigating all
of these strong personalities?
I'm finding them
a little bit difficult.
Really?
Are you for real?
I'm for real.
I've never had to deal
with such big personalities,
and back home I'm the star,
so to get this many
stars in one room?
It's just, like, girl.
Okay, well, is anybody
afraid of choreography?
No.
She didn't like my comedic
take of a punch in the face.
No, ma'am.
I'm always been,
like, putting in
my little comedic
chime in there,
but you're shutting it down,
so I'm probably
gonna do it anyway
regardless of
what Chi Chi says.
I prefer the whole thing
to be choreographed.
I feel safer,
and I think
I'm having a hard time
getting her to actually
put down the steps.
Maybe you should be
more of a tyrant.
I cannot be a tyrant.
That's not in my blood.
I think I'll give that part
to Acid Betty.
-Oh.
-Yeah.
Are you a tyrant,
Acid Betty?
No, I haven't showed
that side yet.
Girl.
She's the leader,
so I'm letting her
kind of make decisions.
All right,
get back to work,
and knock 'em dead.
-All right. Thanks.
-Thank you.
Let's get this work done.
All right, ladies,
gather round.
Now, if at any time
during this competition
you feel the need
to get something
off your chesticles--
yes, take advantage
of the Shade Tree.
-Uh-oh.
-Oh.
<i>Think of it as a diary room</i>
where you can say whatever
you want in total privacy.
-[all] Ooh.
So good luck,
and don't fuck it up.
-All right?
-[all] All right.
Hey, hey, hey,
Team Lady Bitches.
We're ladies,
and we're bitches.
My team are setting up
to met Jamal.
I'm so excited about that.
He's a sexy--mmm--
chocolate flavor.
[laughs]
[record scratches]
Did my teeths look yellow?
No.
Let me something
y'all put together.
We have, like,
a pose that we do,
which is, like,
a one, two, look pose.
We like to incorporate
our little move.
Uh-huh,
it's--I--I see it.
Jamal's
pretty much like,
"Oh, well, that's cute,
but no."
You guys are Lady Bitches,
and so I really want
to present you guys
dancing very up,
very, you know,
trained and very precise
and classic.
So let's start
from the top, yeah?
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight.
One, two, three,
four, five, six.
Let me see you do it.
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.
Kim Chi
is the worst dancer...
Whoops.
In "Drag Race" history.
-[both]
One, two, three, four.
<i>We're not doing crazy stuff.</i>
We're not pirouetting
and back flipping.
Step, touch,
<i>and not only that,</i>
<i>it's the first move.</i>
We're fucked.
One, two, three,
four, five, six.
All right,
something's going on here.
Yeah, I'm, like,
losing it with the arms.
-I'm trying to--
-Yeah.
Don't think about the arms.
Let's get the feet first.
-Okay, right first or--
-Right first.
It's profoundly difficult
to try and do all these steps
<i>but then also I have to think,</i>
"I need to stand out
as a character."
Let me have you two
do it by yourselves.
Don't be--one, two.
Okay, can we--
can we start over.
I'm so sorry.
-All right.
-Don't be--
-[both]
Jealous of my boogie.
Three, four, five.
Okay, listen.
One, two, three, four.
All right, and right now
you guys are doing
three, four, five, six,
so on one, two.
One, two, three, four, five.
<i>What?</i>
It's like I'm learning English
all over again.
Don't be afraid.
Right now you're
looking like this.
Let it go, all right?
Here we go.
Five, six, seven.
Don't be--
Whoa.
Uh-oh.
Are you all right,
sweetie?
<i>Kim Chi falls,</i>
and just my heart
drops out of my cuckoo.
<i>Oh, my God.</i>
Kim Chi,
are you sure you want
to keep doing it in heels?
-100%.
-Okay.
She need to nail this
because if she falls tomorrow
in front of the judges live,
we are completely done.
Shady Bitches in the house.
-[all] Hey.
<i>So we're working with</i>
<i>the fabulous Jamal Sims.</i>
<i>I'm ready for him to just</i>
<i>give us some structure</i>
to this dance routine
that I've come up with.
Show me what you got.
Well, what about this?
Tit, tit,
ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah,
Titi, Titicaca.
Seven, eight.
-Ay.
-[all] Ay!
-Ay.
[all] What!
-Ay.
[all] Oh!
-Ay.
-[all] Bitch.
-[all] La-la, la, la-la.
All right, guys.
So you guys have
a lot of good ideas,
and I think we could kind of
clean 'em up and make 'em...
-Together.
-Cohesive.
"Cohesive" is the word.
I'm so happy that we have
a little bit of choreography
like I suggested--
Chi Chi,
<i>because now we're with Jamal,</i>
and he's actually
using our choreography.
I want to see
"Give me one shot."
-Okay.
-Okay, all right.
All right, we're gonna--
you might want to
be careful with that.
Yeah, that's what
I said right away.
I was like,
"Why are we shooting drugs?"
I don't know.
Give me one shot,
and then from here,
grab each other's arms
so--yeah, lock in
underneath--
-Underneath.
-Underneath.
-There you go.
-Oh, sorry.
Five, six, seven.
-Oh.
-What the hell?
Can we scooch down
a little teeny bit?
Like, can we get a little bit
more space for us?
Thank you.
One more time.
Oh, one more time.
-Sorry.
-Yeah.
Ah!
-Ahh! Boom.
-I really like this moment.
Yeah.
Thank God.
<i>Jamal loved</i>
<i>my adrenaline thing.</i>
<i>He thought it was funny,</i>
<i>and he kept it,</i>
and I was like,
"Eat it."
I want to see this
individually.
There you go.
Next.
-Click, click,
All right.
All right.
Here we go.
Uh, uh.
Look--I keep--
sorry, one more time.
Sorry, sorry.
The look, I forgot.
Let it go.
Just shake it off,
shake it off.
I'm thinking too much.
We'll come back to you.
Your turn.
Five, six, seven.
click, clack--
-Ah!
-Oh, she's a diva.
It's about commitment.
Sweat flying, hair dripping,
whatever, it doesn't matter.
As long as you commit,
you're in it, okay?
How you feeling?
I mean, I'm shaky on it,
but I got to
go through it a few times
and I'll get it.
Like, that's how I work.
Like, I don't pick up
choreography super quick.
Like, if I think while
I'm dancing, I can't do it.
I get really in here,
and it just becomes
all fucked up, so...
Dax's attitude was
really off-putting to me
just because it didn't feel like
she really wanted to do it.
<i>I think there's a lot</i>
<i>of insecurity there</i>
when it comes
to the choreography.
You have to push yourself
on this one,
'cause we don't have
a lot of time.
Totally.
It means a lot
for me to be here,
<i>and I don't want to have</i>
<i>to go back to Savannah</i>
and find some shitty day job
picking up dog shit
or, you know, just doing random
sporadic shows in dive bars.
Like, I want to take
over the world,
<i>and I want to do it now,</i>
<i>and I want to do it with drag,</i>
so I will make it work.
I'm a little nervous,
I'm not gonna lie.
We didn't get
all the way through, so...
<i>So rehearsal is over,</i>
and the Lady Bitches are
in a little bit of trouble.
<i>Kim Chi seems a little too</i>
<i>in her head to pull this off,</i>
<i>and nobody's expecting her</i>
<i>to be the best</i>
<i>dancer in the room,</i>
but she's thinking that,
and that's
what's messing her up.
I remember the choreography,
but my only problem is hitting,
like, the points, like,
at the right time, so.
We can help you with that.
One thing we can't do
is teach you
that rhythm in a day.
Yeah.
But you can, like,
just live in your character,
and like,
if you're offbeat,
just be like--what happened?
'Cause then you're funny.
We're all, like,
rallying around.
We're like, "Kim Chi,
you can do this,"
but Kim Chi is being really,
like, down on herself.
I just really wish, like,
I could hit the beats.
They said last week
that they love
that you're a nerd.
You'll be fine.
[Kim Chi]<i> I am so nervous</i>
<i>about tomorrow.</i>
I really don't want
to let my group down.
Everyone has been
super, super helpful
guiding me through all of this.
<i>I'm not ready to go home yet.</i>
I have so many looks and ideas
that I want to showcase.
Man.
I'm just gonna try my best
and do what I always do.
Uh, uh-uh, uh.
Uh, uh-uh, and stop.
You all okay?
-You guys hot?
-Yes, very.
That means we're
putting in work.
Yeah, that'd be great.
Yeah, do you have
any paper towels?
-Y'all need to focus.
-What?
Y'all need to focus
on what y'all doing.
I think I'm doing
a good job, you know.
Yeah, do a good job
or you're gonna have to
lip-synch against me.
Why do you think you're
gonna be in the bottom?
'Cause I'm the team captain.
They're gonna say,
"The team captain
"should have had everybody
at her's--at her level."
Yes, but I'll be
the first person
to be like, "Mm, she did a
fucking good job as captain."
'Cause she gonna
throw me under the bus.
Fuck yeah,
I'll be honest as fuck.
-She was--
-What'd I do?
You were like, "At least
I can lip-synch for myself.
I know I was gonna be all that."
That's what you did.
But then I
pulled it back together.
She pulled
the team together, yeah.
You can say
that if they ask me.
Exactly.
Betty is being
so negative,
and, like, counterproductive,
and I'm like, "Oh, my God.
This is so stupid."
It is what it is.
Just hope you're not
lip-synching
against me, darling.
<i>I don't have time</i>
<i>to coddle this girl.</i>
We're both on this
competition together.
When that bus comes by,
I'm gonna throw her first.
I told her that too.
-Oh.
-Shady Bitches.
Ooh, we're gonna kill
the Shady Ladies.
Oh, my goodness.
Time to get styling.
<i>Today's elimination day.</i>
<i>This the first time we're</i>
<i>performing for the judges.</i>
I'm very nervous.
How did your group's
rehearsal go?
It went well.
I was nervous
as fuck at first,
but I have to understand
that everybody's not a dancer,
and everybody's not gonna
catch on as fast as me,
so I can't be
frustrated about it.
-You know what I mean?
-Oh, yeah.
This challenge--when I first
got it, I'm like, "Oh, my God.
This is, like,
my biggest nightmare."
Everybody's not
a born dancer.
Yeah.
<i>Growing up,</i>
<i>I was definitely an outsider.</i>
The weird, fat art kid
<i>who had a strong lisp</i>
<i>and a strong accent,</i>
<i>and that's why</i>
<i>I just really never learned</i>
<i>how to dance</i>
<i>and never learned how to,</i>
like, feel the music.
I used to be 350 pounds.
-350?
-Jesus.
Yeah.
-Until about 3 1/2 years ago.
-[both] Wow.
Obviously, like, I'm not
as fat as I was before,
but the fat kid is,
like, still in me.
Yeah, no,
it never goes away, girl.
Come on, proof.
This is me fat.
-Oh, queen.
-Oh, my God.
Girl, you look
completely different.
I was chubby too.
I was always aware it,
like, when I was kid, like,
'cause other kids
made it very apparent like,
"Mm, reminding you.
Not only are you super gay,
but you're also chubby."
<i>When I was an overweight kid,</i>
<i>being ridiculed</i>
<i>and made fun of,</i>
<i>I wanted to have that poise</i>
<i>and that confidence</i>
<i>and that power,</i>
and now finally with drag
I can do that.
That's how it was.
Like, when you're fat,
people just, like,
just don't treat you like--
-Like a person?
-Yeah.
Like taking public transit,
people never sit next to you.
Really, you notice
things like that?
All the time.
<i>Because of those experiences,</i>
<i>I'm still learning</i>
how to be confident in myself
and how to be comfortable
in my own skin,
<i>but just like all the other</i>
<i>things I'm doing here,</i>
<i>I want to commit to it</i>
<i>and become better.</i>
Did people start hitting on
you when you lost the weight?
I'm still a virgin, so no.
-What?
-What?
I was totally coming onto you
when I met you that one time.
Maybe people
are hitting on you
and you literally
have no clue.
Is that a possibility?
-Not really; I don't know.
-Yes, yes.
I think so.
Acid said she was
hitting on you and you--
I was, hard too.
I just thought
you were being friendly.
I'm gagging.
Hopefully someone
sees the beauty in me
one of these days.
<i>I don't think Kim Chi knows</i>
<i>what she looks like.</i>
<i>She's still a virgin</i>
<i>because she's not aware</i>
that she's, like,
a good-looking 6'4" man.
You got to own that.
-So, Cynthia.
-Uh-huh?
What was it
like in Puerto Rico?
Oh, amazing.
They got a lot of gangs
in Puerto Rico too.
Yes.
When I was
younger, girl,
I wanted to be in a gang.
Girl, I had a gun,
a .38 Special.
-What?
-Yes, God.
I was a little gangbanger.
Girl, I've seen people shot.
Oh, my God.
I've smelled, like,
the smell of brains.
Chi Chi, that is insane.
Girl, to see my mom
break down and cry?
That was it.
Plus my daddy beat the hell
out of me for having a gun.
-Good parenting.
-Yeah.
I can't even imagine.
When I tell you
I come from the streets,
I'm not kidding.
People don't make it
where I come from.
Were you doing
all of that
with gangs and everything
'cause you were trying
to hide the fact
that you were gay?
Yeah,
'cause I was afraid
of what my mom,
my brother, you know,
everybody would think of me.
<i>When I look back,</i>
<i>I can kind of see</i>
<i>why I was acting out.</i>
It was because
I wasn't being me.
<i>When I finally came out,</i>
it was a turning point
in my life.
I could have been dead.
I could have been locked up,
but I'm here with you girls.
I feel blessed,
bitch, to be here.
And you're a role model,
an example
for the future generations.
So, so proud of you, baby.
Baby, I overcame it.
-All right.
-Okay.
Can I get an amen?
-[all] Amen.
-[speaking Spanish]
-What?
What does that mean?
"If you can't love yourself,
how the hell you can
love somebody else?"
I will never read
another queen on TV again.
I know, bitch,
no, ma'am.
Who does she think she is?
Blahbedy-blah-blah-blah.
Hasn't she ever heard
of a lace front?
Blippity, bloppity, bloopity.
If I was on
"RuPaul's Drag Race,"
I tell you what I would do.
Ain't that
the truth, right?
I would do this,
and I'd never do that.
Cut, too, girl.
<i>[upbeat music]</i>
<i>["Cover Girl" by RuPaul plays]</i>
<i>[laughs]</i>
Welcome to the main stage
of "RuPaul's Drag Race."
My duet partner Michelle Visage.
-Don't you look eloguent?
-[laughs]
and the writer and the arranger
of "Bitch Perfect,"
Lucian Piane,
is here.
Hey, Ru.
Our dean of dance,
Jamal Sims.
Were my girls ladies or shady?
It was a bit of both.
[laughs]
Just the way I like 'em,
and multi-talented
singer, songwriter,
and actress,
Miss Ester Dean.
Girl, you co-wrote "Firework,"
"Super Bass," "S&amp;M."
When you gonna
write a song for us to do?
I'm gonna write it right now.
[laughter]
This week we challenged
our queens to be bitch perfect
in a dragappella
lip-sync extravaganza.
Gentlemen,
start your engines,
and may the best woman win.
<i>Once a year, two rival</i>

Well, look who's here
for an off-key kiki.
<i>Have a sing off</i>
<i>with the Shady Bitches</i>

I thought I smelled
out of tuna fishes.
Oh, hell no.
The rules are simple.
Keep it cute or sashay away.
Category is RuPaul.
Bitches better beware.
Oh, really?
Is that all you got?
What about this?
<i>Yeah, so what's up?</i>
<i>What else you got?</i>
<i>We'll show you what's up.</i>
<i>[beat boxing]</i>
Oh, yeah?
Well, listen to our beats.

Yes, the ALMA Awards.
Hola, como estas.
<i>I love my runway look.</i>
<i>My hair is very Latina.</i>
<i>It's like Roselyn Sánchez</i>

You know who else it is?
It's...

-That's who it is.
-Yes. Adiós.

-[all] Yes.
Afro she better don't.
<i>I'm wearing this black gown.</i>
<i>It's completely see-through.</i>
<i>I have great legs;</i>
<i>I got 'em on eBay.</i>
<i>I like to do looks that are,</i>
<i>like, very natural black woman,</i>
<i>so I'm wearing my hair</i>
<i>slicked straight back</i>
<i>with a nice afro</i>
<i>in the back.</i>
<i>I just want to look elegant,</i>
<i>and I think I'm pulling it off.</i>
What's she gonna
do with all that?
[laughter]
Ooh, "Good Times."
Derrick Barry.
-[laughs]
-Ann-Margrock.
-Mm-hmm.
<i>I'm giving you</i>
<i>Vegas red carpet.</i>
<i>I want it to be</i>

<i>I wanted a big pompadour.</i>
<i>The curtains definitely</i>

Would she be a ginger?
She's a ginger, yes.
-Oh, okay.
-She's got an AMBER Alert.
-Yes.
-Whoo.
Laila McQueen.
I want to be seen in green.
-[both] Yes.
<i>This is a very</i>
<i>atypical look from Laila.</i>
<i>I am trying to be</i>
<i>a classy broad this evening.</i>
<i>I am rocking these iridescent</i>
<i>purple and green sequins.</i>
<i>I'm trying to show the judges</i>
<i>that I can be glamorous.</i>
<i>I'm not always</i>
<i>just a nasty slut</i>
<i>with smeared black lipstick.</i>
Oh, and then
there's that too.
-All right.
-Wooden.
[laughter]
Laila McQueen,
pretty in green.
-Robbie Turner.
-Yes, Marilyn.
Her glamour-puss is on fire.
Yes, it is.
<i>I chose a Vera Wang</i>
<i>wedding gown</i>
<i>that was hand dyed</i>
<i>strawberry red,</i>
<i>and it is to die for.</i>
<i>I know some bitch is gonna</i>
<i>want to buy it off of me,</i>

She's here to accept her Oscar

Hollywood glamour.
Why don't you come up

Slow motion with it.
Uh-huh.
That's right.
Sneak all of this in right here.
Mm-hmm.
<i>I chose this delicate-looking</i>
<i>flower fantasy.</i>
<i>It's ethereal,</i>
<i>serene, avant-garde,</i>
<i>and there is a very</i>
<i>innocent quality to this look.</i>
<i>I just want to feel</i>

<i>a cherry blossom tree</i>
<i>that just came down</i>
<i>to the ground to party</i>
<i>with all the earthlings.</i>
-Bam.
-Oh.
-Bam.
-Oh, yes.
She's like Anna Mae West.
Gorgeous.
We'll take a journey
through her poppy field.
Chi Chi DeVayne.
She is your dream girl.
Oh, stop.
Shine, Dina, shine.
<i>I'm stomping it down.</i>

"RuPaul's Drag Race"
Fashion Week
presents Naomi Smalls.
-Come on, baby.
-Ooh, yes.
<i>I know that the judges</i>
<i>are admiring me</i>
<i>from every angle.</i>
<i>The hair is right.</i>
<i>The legs are right.</i>
<i>The shoes are right.</i>
<i>The face is right.</i>
<i>Everything's right.</i>
<i>I just made</i>

Serving legs,

Cover girl.
Acid Betty.
Oh, architecture.
She is giving 1970s
Pat Cleveland on the runway.
-Yes.
-You know what, Ru?
-Huh?
-She don't fool me.
-I see right through her.
-[laughter]
<i>I've chosen to wear</i>
<i>this skin color gown</i>
<i>and, of course, my fierce</i>
<i>Philip Treacy wannabe hat.</i>
<i>This outfit is couture</i>
<i>made just for me,</i>
<i>and no other bitch</i>
<i>will have one.</i>
Is that a new telephone?
-Bluetooth.
-This is the 5G network.
[laughter]
Dax ExclamationPoint.
Southern belle.
Come on, Lonette McKee.
"Cotton Club."
-Can I borrow a cup of flour?
-She's all out.
[laughter]
<i>Tonight on the runway</i>
<i>I'm serving</i>
<i>lady sings</i>
<i>the green and gold blues.</i>
<i>I'm not a gown girl,</i>
<i>but I really want to show</i>
<i>that I have clothes</i>
<i>that can touch the floor,</i>
<i>and I want to show them</i>
<i>a different silhouette</i>
<i>than I normally would wear.</i>
Yes, bang, bang
into the room.
Thorgy Thor.
-She doing the neutron dance.
-Oh, yeah.
Thorgy Minnelli.
<i>Whoo, it's disco, bitch.</i>
<i>I decided to not wear</i>
<i>what everyone else is wearing,</i>
<i>which was a boring gown.</i>
<i>I'm wearing my big</i>
<i>Donna Summer hair</i>
<i>and my sequin jumpsuit</i>
<i>that I made from scratch.</i>
<i>I'm comfy,</i>
<i>and I'm feeling it.</i>
"Xanadu."
I want to dance
with your somebody.
She's the drag daughter
of a "Solid Gold" dancer.
Welcome, ladies.
Now, this week
you performed in teams,
but tonight you'll be
judged as individuals.
Harshly.
When I call your name,
please step forward.
Laila McQueen.
Thorgy Thor.
Kim Chi.
Acid Betty.
Dax ExclamationPoint.
Chi Chi DeVayne.
Ladies,
you represent the tops
and the bottoms
of the week,
and the rest of you bitches
in the background...
are safe.
You may leave the stage.
Now it's time
for the judges' critiques.
Ladies,
you represent the tops
and the bottoms of the week.
Now it's time for
the judges' critiques.
First up,
Laila McQueen.
Hello, Laila,
I think the dress is pretty.
The problem is,
you're lost in it.
The hair is flat and long.
Everything's being pulled down.
You can see none of you.
And as far as
the performance goes,
I feel like I wasn't getting
much of the comedy,
especially with the big
personalities around you.
Up next, Kim Chi.
I can tell
that you cannot dance,
but on the positive side
of that, you chose a character
to cover up
that you can't dance,
and it worked.
I don't mind
that you can't dance
because this look
is, like, fantastic.
-Yeah, I just want to smell you.
-Mmm.
I do get concerned
about your walk.
I'm not sure anymore
that it's a choice.
It's very stiff, darling.
Give yourself over to it.
Allow yourself to have fun
on this runway.
How do you say
"sissy that walk" in Korean?
-[speaking Korean]
-[speaking Korean]
-Pow, pow.
-Yes, yes, yes.
[speaking Korean]
Up next, Louisiana glamour.
Bayou country.
Chi Chi DeVayne.
-Hey, y'all.
-[laughs]
It's funny 'cause
we shot "Pitch Perfect"
in Baton Rouge,
so you make me feel really good
by hearing your voice.
Your performance today,
you turned it completely out.
That got them ass clap.
You know, they'd be
throwing some dollars
at your ass real fast.
You definitely are
my new trap queen.
So tonight,
I think you look--
for lack of a better term,
sort of basic.
Look around.
This is a crew that came
to play this season.
But she looks amazing.
I love the red dress.
"Dreamgirls"
is one of my favorite musicals,
so right now you're giving me
Sheryl Lee Ralph realness.
I don't really have anything
negative to say about you.
Thank you.
[laughter]
Next up, Acid Betty.
What I really loved
about what you did is,
you were really a team player.
You were concerned
about everybody else,
and I appreciate stuff like that
because it lets
me know you care.
So I love the headpiece.
I love the body art.
I'm not getting the train.
I just like looking
at you right now.
I like looking
at you right now.
-Ha-ha!
-Do you need this?
You can't see
this right now,
but he's got a fistful
of Jergens lotion.
[laughter]
The one thing I'm
concerned about with you is,
you're setting the bar so high.
I'll be waiting to see
if you can keep raising it
'cause when you'll fall,
you'll fall hard.
Is that a challenge,
Michelle?
It's always a challenge when
I throw it out there, darling.
Next up,
Dax ExclamationPoint.
I love your face.
I love the hair.
Something about the bottom
of the dress is not done.
One thing I did notice
from last week.
I have an issue
with your padding.
It almost gives you
a quadru-butt.
Just look at it.
The performance,
I really wanted you
to get that hood,
like, uh, you know,
and it--and it still never came,
and in rehearsals
you were saying,
"Oh, yeah, I'll do it when
I figure out these steps."
I am not a classically
trained dancer in the least,
and like, I was also trying
to kind of create a character
while also thinking too much
about other stuff, and like--
You just got to go.
Whether you do it wrong
or whatever, commit.
All right,
Thorgy Thor.
As far as
the dance portion,
you're one of the people
I didn't have to worry about.
What I love about
the jumpsuit is,
it's smart because
you said, "You know what?
"At a movie premiere,
everybody else
"is gonna do
some glamorous gown.
I'm gonna do something
that's representative of me,"
But you wear your eyes so black
that I'm losing your eyeballs,
so blend it out.
I'll take that challenge, yes.
Thank you, ladies.
Now, while you
untuck backstage,
the judges
and I will deliberate.
Now, just between us altos,
what do you think?
<i>Laila McQueen.</i>
She stood out to me because
she was the most improved.
I would have never thought
she could last through
the whole performance.
But I didn't really
remember what she had done.
The only thing
I remember about her
is the mole
underneath her eye,
so I don't think that's good.
You know what this is?
This season has
very strong personalities.
She's out of her league.
I know she has a fire in her,
but she gonna have
to step her pussy up.
-Oh.
-Kim Chi.
Talk about somebody who's
the polar opposite of Laila.
You can't stop
looking at Kim Chi.
When I see her on the runway,
I was blown away,
<i>but it's so weird to me</i>
<i>that she can't walk in heels.</i>
It could become a trend.
New York Fashion Week,
a sasquatch, a Godzilla.
You better Kim Chi
that walk, girl.
Yes.
But my fear for Kim Chi
is that she is a look.
Because she's had such success
with who she is visually,
<i>she hasn't had</i>
<i>to deliver a performance.</i>
She just had to be really cute
and kind of nerdy and anime-y,
but I think there's
a personality in there.
I just want her to unleash it
and let us have it.
Chi Chi DeVayne.
Tonight on the stage,
did she play it safe?
-Yes.
-I loved her outfit.
It just seemed
very classic and beautiful,
and as far
as the performance goes,
she really slayed
the other girls.
-I mean, really.
-Yes.
She was doing
her neck ghetto style
upside down while twerking
and not missing a word.
Honey, I was ready to make
the Louisiana Purchase
one more time.
[laughter]
Acid Betty.
Energy-wise,
a complete standout.
I particularly loved
her runway look
<i>with that weird</i>
<i>fiber optic spiderweb.</i>
-Yes.
-Everything I love about drag.
Look, it wasn't perfect.
There was weirdness at the back
that looked like draperies
being dry-cleaned.
I would have liked
if that dress just
did the see-through thing
all the way down
because it made
her bottom heavy,
and the color's ugly.
-Sorry.
-Sorry 'bout it.
Dax ExclamationPoint.
Tonight on the runway,
it just was all wrong for me.
The flower did not go
with the dress.
The colors were dull,
and in the performance
you literally forgot
that Dax was there.
In "Pitch Perfect,"
I know what it felt like
to not be a classical dancer.
It just takes courage
to get past it.
She don't want to fight for it.
It's like she's the girl
in the girl group
with the Beyoncé in it.
Beyoncé only stands out
because she really wants it.
-She's the Farrah.
-LaTavia.
I don't want
to call no names.
Thorgy Thor.
She nailed the performance.
She came out in that catsuit.
It was 180 degrees different
from the performance
personality.
-Just hated the shoes.
-Uh-huh.
They look like ugly shoes.
-Well, no,
-My issue is her makeup.
Two times in a row
it's a--two black eyes.
So, Michelle,
what you're saying is that
Thorgy is in an abusive
relationship with her makeup.
Yes.
Silence.
I've made my decision.
Based on your
"Bitch Perfect" performance
and your movie
premiere eleganza,
I've made some decisions.
Thorgy Thor, you're safe.
Thank you.
Chi Chi DeVayne,
not only did
you turn it out,
girl,
you turned it upside down.
Condragulations, you are the
winner of this week's challenge.
-Wow.
-Wow.
-For real?
-Really, Ru?
Chi Chi sucked as a leader.
<i>I won a challenge.</i>
<i>I'm definitely on the radar.</i>
Y'all girls better look out.
You've won
a four-night getaway
to an all gay
bed and breakfast
in beautiful New England
courtesy of MyGayGetaway.com.
So I get to go overseas?
No, New England is here
in the United States.
-Oh, okay.
-[laughter]
Chi Chi,
you may cross the seas
-and join the other girls.
-Whoo!
Acid Betty,
you're safe.
Thank you.
Dax ExclamationPoint,
the lack of commitment
to your performance
forces me to put a question mark
after your name.
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
<i>I think there were girls</i>
<i>that did worse than me,</i>
and I'm sad,
and I'm just pissed about it.
Laila McQueen,
in your performance
you got lost
in the din and tonic.
Kim Chi, in your performance
you put your left foot forward.
Both of them.
Laila McQueen,
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are
up for elimination.
Kim Chi,
you are safe,
and you may join
the other girls.
Two queens stand before me.
Prior to tonight
you were asked
to prepare
a lip-sync performance
of "I Will Survive"
by Gloria Gaynor.
Ladies, this is your
last chance to impress me
and save yourself
from elimination.
The time has come...
[thunder rumbles]
For you to lip-synch
for your life.
[echoes]
<i>I don't really do disco.</i>
<i>It's just not my genre,</i>
<i>but I'm pretty confident</i>
I can definitely beat,
uh, Laila.
Sorry, I forgot her name
for a second.
<i>I feel the song</i>
<i>that we're doing</i>
<i>has such strong emotion</i>
<i>tied with it,</i>
and Dax is kind of lackluster,
and the song is not lackluster,
<i>so I'm like,</i>
<i>"You got this."</i>
All right, here we go.
Good luck,
and don't fuck it up.
<i>["I Will Survive" playing]</i>
[applause]
Ladies,
I've made my decision.
Dax ExclamationPoint,
Laila McQueen...
Neither one of you
survived that lip sync.
I must ask you both
to sashay away.
Wait, second time
in history of "RuPaul."
Two eliminated!
Thank you, ladies.
You may leave the stage.
Both of us?
<i>We're glad</i>
<i>we made it here,</i>
but it sucks to go home
second, third.
That's about
accurate, yeah.
<i>I know I gave it.</i>
<i>I didn't half-ass it.</i>
I just wish
it hadn't gone this way.
I look forward
to a nap and vodka.
Lots of vodka.
Michelle,
may I borrow your phone?
[phone dialing]
[sighs]
Hi, it's RuPaul.
Who the fuck
is RuPaul talking to?
Listen, I had to eliminate
two queens today.
How soon can you get here?
Fuck.
Someone's coming back.


<i>Previously on</i>
<i>"RuPaul‘s Drag Race"...</i>
You‘ll be competing
in the drag-apella movie,
<i>"Bitch Perfect."</i>
Chi Chi DeVayne,
condragulations, you are the
winner of this week‘s challenge.
Dax ExclamationPoint,
Laila McQueen,
neither one of you survived
that lip sync.
<i>[dramatic music]</i>
Sashay away.
<i>[laid-back music]</i>
-Oh, my God.
-Oh!
I did not
even see that coming.
Gag of the century.
You never know
what‘s gonna happen,
and when you on the stage,
bitch,
you better own it.
<i>This is a wakeup call</i>
<i>for all of us.</i>
If you ain‘t stepping
that pussy up,
your ass is going home.
So who do you guys think
that RuPaul called?
I had to eliminate
two queens today.
How soon can you get here?
One queen who needs
to be redeemed
more than any queen
on the "Drag Race"
is Victoria "Pork Chop" Parker.
Question is
when Shangela returns,
what are we gonna do?
[laughter]
I think we should all agree that
whoever the girl that comes in,
we just ignore her
and treat her like poo.
<i>Damn.</i>
We have another bitch
coming into the competition?
<i>[dramatic tones]</i>
Girl,
this is some bullshit.
<i>The winner</i>
<i>of "RuPaul‘s Drag Race"</i>
<i>receives</i>
<i>a one-year supply</i>
<i>of Anastasia</i>
<i>Beverly Hills cosmetics</i>
<i>and a cash prize of $100,000.</i>
<i>With extra-special guest judges</i>
<i>"Empire‘s" Tasha Smith</i>
<i>and the legendary</i>
<i>Faith Evans!</i>
<i>(tires screeching)</i>
<i>[upbeat music]</i>
-Work.
-Work.
[laughter]
It‘s a brand-new day!
We‘ve survived.
<i>[siren wails]</i>
<i>Ooh, girl.</i>
<i>She done already</i>
<i>done had herses.</i>
<i>To be America‘s</i>
<i>next drag superstar,</i>
<i>you don‘t need to be humble.</i>
Agreed.
<i>But if you trip or stumble,</i>
<i>well, honey, that‘s just</i>
<i>the way that cookie crumbles.</i>
<i>[chuckles dramatically]</i>
[laughter]
[door squeaking]
Hello, hello, hello.
[cheers and applause]
-Wow!
-This is the outfit.
Why, thank you.
It is a
Klein Epstein &amp; Parker suit.
They‘re made to measure.
[laughs]
Now, ladies,
when the Supreme Court
legalized same sex marriage,
they moved this country
boldly forward.
But when it comes
to their sense of style,
the justices are,
like, so 18th century.
Yeah.
Oh, Pit Crew!
- Whoo!
- Oh!
Now for today‘s
mini challenge,
I want you to drag up
these basic black robes.
Think Judge Judy Couture.
We‘ll take a 30-minute recess,
and then, the Supreme Court
Fashion Show will be in session.
Go!
Ah!
(laughter)
<i>(upbeat music)</i>
Think this looks like
absolute garbage, and I love it.
Ladies! Time‘s up.
Category is,
Supreme Court Realness.
<i>(gavel pounding)</i>
First up,
Bob The Drag Queen.
She received
her law degree online
from the Tyler Perry "I Can
Learn Law All By Myself" school.
Supreme Court Justice
Naomi Smalls
from the law firm
of Evangelista and Fangs.
She almost got disbarred
-for excessive mouth pops.
-[pops]
That was only one.
[popping]

Justice Derrick Barry.
She was inspired to study law
after sneaking into a matinee
of "Legally Blonde."
Oh!
Oh, and then my wig come off.

[record scratches]
-Really, Judge?
-[laughs]
I think it was funny.
[laughs]
-(Rupaul)Supreme Court Justice
Acid Betty.
She believes
in every citizen‘s right
to go fisting.
[record scratches]
Uh, it said...
I‘m sorry, it‘s go fishing.
[laughter]
-(RuPaul)Supreme Court Justice
Robbie Turner.
If Justice Turner

she‘d outlaw ex-boyfriend
Donald Trump.
[laugh]
-(RuPaul)All rise

Kim Chi.
She got her start at the law
firm of Ching Chang &amp; Chong.
I did not write these.
[laughter]
Do not send me letters.
-(RuPaul)Supreme Court Justice
Thorgy Thor.
She made herstory
legalizing the right

[car horn honks]
[laughter]
-(RuPaul)All rise
for Supreme Court Justice

She made herstory

Yes, Your Honor, yes.
If justice is blind,

[laughter]
The winner is...
<i>[drum roll]</i>
Naomi Smalls.
-Nice!
-Ooh!
And I‘ll be posting
all of these supreme looks
at logotv.com.
Ladies, last week,
several eliminations
left a void
that I‘ve decided to fill
with the one and only...
<i>[dramatic music]</i>
Bitches, I‘m back!
[all screaming]
Naysha Lopez.
Oh, my God,
it‘s Naysha!
She‘s back on the competition.
Naysha should have walked in
with her luggage
and just kept on walking.
Bye, girl.
Naysha, you‘re getting
a second chance.
-So don‘t fuck it up.
-Okay.
Now, for this week‘s
maxi challenge,
you‘ll be overacting
in a pilot for my new TV series,
"RuCo‘s Empire."
#DragEmpire
-Whoo!
-[laughs]
That‘s right,
RuRu kitty girls.
It‘s cookie time.
-Whoo!
-[laughs]
Naomi Smalls,
you won the mini challenge.
So you‘re a team captain.
And Naysha Lopez,
as a welcome back gift,
you‘re team captain too.
<i>I‘m not trying to fuck</i>
<i>my second chance,</i>
so let‘s do this.
Naomi, you get first pick.
-I choose Robbie Turner.
-All right.
-[laughs]
-Naysha.
-Derrick Barry.
-Yay!
-Bob The Drag Queen.
-Whoo!
-Thorgy.
-Yes!
-Awesome.
-Whoo!
-Chi Chi.
-Whoo.
-Kim Chi.
-Yeah!
Well, that leaves Acid Betty
and "Santee Alley" Fontaine.
<i>[suspenseful tones]</i>
I‘m gonna go
with "Santee Alley."
Which means Acid Betty,
you are on Naysha‘s team.
Oh, fuck.
Just kidding.
[laughter]
Gentlemen,
start your engines.
And may
the smartest cookie win.
Okay, so let‘s go through
all of them real quick.
"Ginger Snap,
classic militant activist."
She‘s intense, so you want
to take that role?
Uh...
<i>Derrick‘s playing</i>
<i>this militant lesbian.</i>
Really?
"Chocolate Chip Cookie,
the over-the-top super diva.
She‘s got major attitude
and blingy style."
I will feel comfortable
with Chocolate Chip Cookie,
personally.
There‘s a lot of words
in this.
Did you look at the script?
That‘s right,
Chocolate Chip Cookie‘s back!
I did not understand at all
what you said.
[high pitched]
And this gonna be my chance
to win back Rucious for good!
Why are you talking up here
like that?
<i>Think the other team</i>
<i>should be worried</i>
because they have a lot of girls
that are just like...
not black.
"You double-crossing bitches."
<i>For today‘s challenge,</i>
we have to perform in scenes
inspired by the show, "Empire."
<i>It‘s got drama.</i>
<i>It‘s got Cookie.</i>
I mean,
this is a dream come true.
"Maybe it was a lil‘
somethin‘-somethin‘ extra
I put in the drink."
[laughs]
<i>-(Naomi)I‘ve never seen</i>
<i>"Empire," but Cookie sounds</i>
<i>like a handful.</i>
And Bob is a fuckin‘ handful,
so it‘s just a match
made in heaven.
One thing I would say,
make it, like a
"Or maybe..."
-Let‘s do it again.
-‘Cause it got lost.
Robbie,
she‘s a trained actress
and she‘s giving us
all these tips.
Like, this whole thing,
and then be like,
"Stand back, bitches!"
[laughter]
We‘re definitely
gonna win this challenge.
"What you want?
Oh, hello, Rucious‘s doctor."
It‘s Rucious‘s doctor.
This is one stale-ass
Chocolate Chip Cookie.
Just an observation
that I‘m just making,
Thorgy and Kim Chi switch.
-I would love to.
-Yeah, super diva.
This is gonna be so good.
I really want to do this.
"Oh, you better think again,
RuRu kitty.
That‘s right;
Chocolate Chip Cookie is back."
"Did I hear my name?"
It sounded
like Bob was doing...
-Of course.
-Yeah.
We‘re gonna be up
against each other.
What part did you pick, Bob?
Chocolate Chip Cookie.
Of course
both myself and Bob
are playing
Chocolate Chip Cookie parts,
and we‘re gonna be compared.
Rivalry!
Thorgy‘s hilarious,
but I‘m like,
"I am not worried about that."
"Well, where the hell
is Rucious? Rucious!"
<i>There‘s a fire under my ass.</i>
And I really, really fucking
want to win the challenge.
<i>[upbeat music]</i>
All right.
Team Naysha.
<i>It‘s time to shoot the scene,</i>
and everyone‘s feeling
a little nervous.
Welcome to our beautiful set,
furnished by our friends
at Rrivre Works.
And say hello to my co-director.
Grammy award-winning
First Lady of hip-hop,
Faith Evans is here.
-Hey.
-Hi, ladies.
What‘s up?
Mm-hmm.
All right, places,
people, places.
-It takes a village, people.
-Jesus, be my savior.
Here we go, and...
together: Action.
I‘m here to get what‘s mine.
No, you‘re not.
[in deep voice] Yes, she is.
Who are you?
[in deep voice]
Stop interrupting me.
[chuckles]
You all need to chill.
The big RuCo White party
is coming up.
And cut.
Kim Chi,
I need to see more of this.
I need to see this.
We smack a lot
when we ratchet.
-[smacking lips] Girl.
-Mm-hmm.
[no sound]
Like this.
[clicks tongue]
[all clicking tongues]
Um...yeah.
Let‘s try that again.
Listen, Ho Ho!
[smacks teeth]
[laughs]
Chocolate Chip Cookie‘s
supposed to be in jail!
[clicks tongue]
[laughter]
That was much better.
And action.
I‘m gonna make you a star.
Bitch, you couldn‘t
even make bail.
-Ooh...
-[laughs]
But I can whoop yo ass.
[both grunting]
[all gasp]
[laughter]
<i>Nobody wants a bitch who</i>
<i>gets kicked off to come back,</i>
so I was glad to beat
the shit out of her
with this dirty broom.
[laughter]
The White party is the time
for me to tell the whole world,
it‘s okay to be gay.
Cut.
Derrick, I‘m losing you
in that moment.
I know--you‘re not sort of
connecting with anyone.
Just make sure
that you command the room.
Okay.
The White Party is the time
for me to tell the whole world,
that it‘s okay...
[cries]
It‘s okay to be gay.
What the hell
is Derrick doing?
<i>She‘s lost in an afro.</i>
<i>She‘s not funny.</i>
Come on, Britney.
Step it up.
Team Naomi.
My co-director,
Faith Evans is here.
Hi, ladies.
This Notorious B.I.G.‘s wife.
<i>I got my drag name</i>
<i>from Biggie Smalls,</i>
so I‘m fucking freaking out.
Now, she has lived this life,
so if you have
any questions for her
in terms of character
or inspiration...
What‘s the best hand
to slap a hoe with,
like, the left or the right?
Well, I‘m left-handed.
[laughter]
All right, so places,
people, places.
Action.
Now where the hell is Rucious?
Rucious!
Rucious probably smelled you
and went runnin‘.
Well, then why
did I waste my time
puttin‘ on this.
[cheers and laughter]
Why you all gaggin‘?
I bring it to you every episode.
-[laughing]
-Cut.
<i>You say this is</i>
<i>an over-acting challenge,</i>
I‘m like,
[puffs].
You ain‘t gotta tell me twice.
Action.
[laughing]
And that‘s why they need
a strong woman on this company.
Cut.
Miss Cynthia Lee, you just
left out the word "gay,"
when you said this company needs
a strong, gay woman.
Yes, because that‘s...
that‘s the joke.
Okay, let‘s try that again.
This company need
a gay, strong woman.
Wait, cut.
The line is,
"A strong, gay woman."
I‘m a strong, gay woman!
<i>Cynthia‘s Ginger Snap</i>
<i>is hilarious</i>
for all the wrong reasons.
I don‘t even know if she knows
what she‘s saying.
[whistles]
All right.
Let‘s move on.
That and how to shoplift.
Empty your pockets,
please, ma‘am.
Fuck, line.
Robbie, differentiate
those voices,
so that we know
it‘s two different people.
Do want it, like,
satanic or something?
[clears throat]
-Just make them different.
-Okay.
That and how to shoplift.
[stammering]
Please, sir, empty your...
[high pitched] Please ma‘am,
will you empty your pocketbook?
Ah!
Robbie is really
screwing it up.
<i>You‘re the one</i>
<i>I was most confident in.</i>
We‘re gonna have
to work with what we have.
We could end up losing this
because of Robbie‘s mistakes.
For the first time
in drag herstory,
the girls are gonna do
a runway in roller skates.
So anybody nervous
about skating?
-I‘ve never skated before.
-Really?
Ever.
So since I can‘t skate,
I have this idea,
like, maybe I can, like,
turn into a car
to, like, mask it.
Do you have, like,
wheels for your arms and stuff?
Oh, I have to make
my wheels, so.
-You have to make wheels.
-Yeah.
So he plans on falling
and what,
crawling across the stage
like a Transformer?
This is a mess
I can‘t wait to see.
How you feelin‘, Robbie?
I feel...actually...
better.
Girl, I‘m the disco rockin‘ diva
of the roller rink.
And my hope is that
my runway look redeems me
from that horrible performance
in the acting challenge.
I‘m actually wearing my mom‘s
vintage sunglasses,
which I‘m really excited about.
My parents
were straight-up hippies.
I would love,
love to meet your parents.
My mom, uh, passed away
when I was 19.
-What happened?
-She had cancer.
I was in college,
like, having a blast,
and, like, I would always call
and be like,
"How‘s everything?"
It was always fine.
But it wasn‘t.
And I finally got a call
from my dad being like,
"You know, you should probably
really come home."
When I went home, I mean,
she was not the--
She was not a person.
She...
She wasn‘t there.
I wish they were just a little
bit more honest with me,
‘cause when I got home,
she died that day.
Oh, my God.
She was a skeleton
in a hospital bed.
<i>-(Thor)I didn‘t really get a</i>
<i>good-bye.</i>
<i>And I kinda feel like</i>
<i>that was taken from me.</i>
And I‘m very angry about it,
but I don‘t know
where to put that anger.
It comes out of love for my dad,
he‘s like,
"I just don‘t want to, like,
interrupt your life and ruin...
Like, I want better things
for you."
And I‘m like, I get that...
"My parents wanted
to protect me."
But things like that, like...
I didn‘t get to say
good-bye to her.
She didn‘t want
to make my dad and my sister
feel, like, terrible,
but...
How come they didn‘t, like,
tell me to come home?
I will never forget that day.
I guess that‘s why
I talk about things so much.
Just get it over with.
That‘s a great idea.
Keep doing that.
<i>[upbeat music]</i>
<i>["Cover Girl" by RuPaul plays]</i>
<i>[laughs]</i>
-Yeah!

Oh!
That‘s a bubble butt
if I ever seen one.
-Kim Chi.
-Toucan!
Look at the size

<i>-(Kim Chi)The entire ensemble</i>

[laughter]
See you later, roller skater.
Bob The Drag Queen.
Not to be confused with
Bob The High School Counselor.
<i>I didn‘t have enough time to</i>
<i>finish this Transformer outfit,</i>
<i>-(Bob) so I do my backup plan.</i>
<i>I‘m like "Tron,"</i>
<i>robot-inspired character.</i>
-She‘s a ro--oh, yes girl.
-Uh-oh. Be careful.
<i>And I‘m just like,</i>
<i>try to move</i>
<i>offstage without</i>
<i>breaking a limb.</i>
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa whoa.

-Nice save.
She‘s like a rumba!
Don‘t go too fast now.
Don‘t go too fast.
[shrieks]
Oh, work it!
[laughter and applause]
Cynthia Lee Fontaine.
She‘s a little bit country.
It‘s Barbara Mandrell
on wheels.
<i>-(Cynthia)I love my runway</i>
<i>look.</i>
<i>It‘s like Farrah Fawcett</i>

I did?
[normal voice]
No, I didn‘t!
Oh, cray-cray.
I got this.
- My baby‘s got talent.

[RuPaul and Michelle laugh]
And that‘s for not visiting me

We know.
But damn, my little baby‘s

Y‘all need to chill!
The big White Record party‘s
comin‘ up,

<i>[dramatic percussive music]</i>
Girls, at this

[creepy laughter]
I know y‘all ain‘t starting
this white-ass party without me.
And why it gotta be white,
you know?
[laughs]
Uh, where‘s Rucious?
Rucious!
Rucious probably smelled you
and went runnin‘.
Oh, well, then
why did I waste my time.
putting on this?
Oh, there‘s more.
This!
Why‘d I waste my time
doin‘ that, bitch?
‘Cause you the crazy ass hoe.
[chuckles]
Where‘d you learn
to talk like that?
I learned it from you, bitch.
That‘s about the only thing
you taught us.
Yeah, that,
and how to shoplift.
Empty your pockets,
please, ma‘am.
[high pitched]
I didn‘t do it!
Mama told me to!
Well, well.
This is nice,
but let‘s have a drink.
[stammering and shrieking]
In this house,
before we drink,
we say grace.
Now can I get
a "Amen, hallelu"?
All right,
I knew you had it, baby!
-Yes!
-I knew you had it.
Stop oppressing me!
I‘m a strong, gay woman!
all: Bitch, we‘re all gay.
I‘m not gay.
[in a deep voice]
Yes, you are.
[normal voice] That one time
in college doesn‘t count.
My baby.
-[grunts]
-Jeez!
Girl, you better step
your medications up.
Wow, you really all are crazy.
That‘s why I‘m secretly
plotting to go work
for our rival company,
Lady Bunny Death Hoe Records.
[all gasp]
You fake-ass,
Dominique Deveraux wannabe!
-[screams]
-Oh, my God.
Take it, bitch.
Expensive vodka.
Stand back, bitches.
Bring it, bitch.
[stammering and shouting]
[phone ringing]
You lucky
my pre-paid phone ringin‘.
I woulda whooped
your little skinny ass.
Who dis?
It‘s Rucious‘ doctor, y‘all.
Hello, Rucious‘s doctor.
What, what?
Rucious is...
severely deadly illnesses
is...contagious?
[all screams]
Oh!
Is because I‘m gay?
Isn‘t it?
Peace.
Oh...
I guess whatever Rucious had,
it really was sickening.
[laughs]
Or maybe it was a lil‘
extra somethin-somethin
I put in the cocktails.
[maniacal laugh]
Oh, you thirsty, bitch?
[laughs]
Whoo!
I‘ma take this motherfucker.
Gimme the shoe, bitch.
[laughs]
Oh!
Look at all this money.
He ain‘t got
no motherfucking backup.
Is the train still runnin‘?
[laughter]
[cheers and applause]
Wow.
Well, there you have it,
ladies.
And all based on actual events.
[laughs]
Ladies, this week
you acted in teams.
but tonight,
you‘ll be judged individually.
Ladies,
when I call your names,
please roll forward.
Naomi Smalls.
Kim Chi.
Naysha Lopez.
Chi Chi DeVayne.
Ladies, you are safe.
You may leave the stage.
<i>[upbeat music]</i>
The rest of you
represent the high rollers
and the low rollers
of the week.
Now it‘s time
for the judges‘ critiques.
Starting with Thorgy Thor.
Your roller girl look
You‘re giving me ‘70s.
You had the big blonde ‘fro.
-Not the most wildly inventive.
- Okay.
Now I‘m gonna go
to your performance,
which was so good.
Your delivery, your choreography
was meticulously done.
Yes!
[laughs]
I‘m so proud of you.
Great job.
Next up, Derrick Barry.
I like this whole, like,
Jeremy Scott for Katy Perry
kind of thing.
You are doing a great job
with trying
to give us something
other than Brittney.
But I feel like
you‘re coming out
and these clothes
are wearing you.
With your performance,
the personality of the character
didn‘t really connect.
It was too laid back.
I‘d love to see you show me
that you do have soul.
So what you need to get to work
on is giving us your soul.
[chuckles]
Thank you very much.
Next up, Acid Betty.
Your performance,
I felt like you gave me
the "Sybil" multiple personality
with a little bit
of Carol Burnett goin‘ on.
I think you were very
convincing as a schizo.
This look tonight,
it‘s getting kinda predictable.
I‘d love to see something
way different.
-Another challenge, Michelle.
-I fucking love challenges.
Be you but don‘t be you.
Give us less but more.
[laughter]
All right, next up,
Bob The Drag Queen.
I love this look.
You did this Glamazon girl
from "Tron."
Tin Man, I have to say,
needs some lubricant.
[laughs]
Now let‘s get
to the performance.
<i>-(Michelle)Everything about it</i>
<i>was on point.</i>
<i>That adlibs were</i>
<i>really, really good.</i>
Taraji is going to die.
Lee Daniels is going to die.
Next up,
Cynthia Lee Fontaine.
Cynthia.
You have a great body with
a shirt that‘s like a formal
with a formal necklace
and formal earrings,
then you have, like, Hooters
shorts that don‘t fit at all.
It‘s so discombobulated.
The "Empire" scene, I don‘t
know what you were saying,
but I didn‘t care.
There were some nuances
that were missed.
What did you think,
watching yourself in the scene?
I love it.
-[laughs]
-It was really good.
It was really good.
[laughter]
Thank you very much.
All right, next,
Robbie Turner.
I do love the jumpsuit.
But what‘s bothering me
is all the silver accoutrements
and then a gold necklace.
I would lose the necklace.
Um, when we were workin‘
on that scene,
Ru was directing you
to kinda get into
the two different voices.
I don‘t think
you stuck with that.
It was kinda like I
didn‘t have a moment to, like,
break
and think of your notes
before we moved on
to another note
and also remember where
the blocking for the camera was
because I can‘t see very far.
When we originally read it,
I was Vanilla Wafer.
And it--we did change it.
Did that hurt you, you think?
I think it did hurt me,
and I didn‘t speak up
even though I was feeling it,
and so for the betterment
of the team, I was like...
You can‘t allow yourself
to be a victim
and use the excuse of,
"I was being nice."
It‘s a competition.
Well, thank you, ladies.
I think we‘ve heard enough.
While you untuck backstage,
the judges and I
will deliberate.
<i>[car engine starting]</i>
All right, now just
between us squirrel friends,
what do you think?
<i>Thorgy Thor.</i>
Her Chocolate Chip Cookie
killed it.
It‘s safe to say that,
uh, her Chocolate Chip Cookie
was baked in a lovin‘ oven.
together: Mm-hmm.
It brings all the boys
to the yard.
Yeah!
[laughs]
That‘s the milkshake.
-Oh.
-[laughs]
<i>Derrick Barry.</i>
She goes from Britney Spears
to Katy Perry.
I‘m still waiting
to find Derrick Barry.
I thought the runway
was really cute.
But in the scene,
Ginger Snap got lost to me.
I‘ve seen her perform
as Britney Spears.
She puts her whole self into it,
and that‘s what she
needed to do in this challenge.
<i>Acid Betty.</i>
I think she did look
like a roller warrior,
<i>but I could probably</i>
<i>do without the Mohawk.</i>
In this role,
she looks like
she‘s one french fry short
of a Happy Meal straight away.
<i>Bob The Drag Queen.</i>
It‘s not easy to improv,
but also stay focused
on the scene.
I am feelin‘ her swag.
She has charisma and it allows
her to sell absolutely anything.
This Tron jumpsuit
is so basic,
and I found myself goin‘,
"Oh, my God, I love it so much."
[laughter]
This is great.
<i>Cynthia Lee Fontaine.</i>
Bless her cotton socks
with that runway outfit.
-Oh! Oh!
-They were Fruit of the Loom.
I just felt like she didn‘t
commit to the role that she had,
as sweet as she is,
but what‘s sweet
got to do with it?
All right, Ike Turner.
Yes.
<i>Robbie Turner.</i>
You had given
a lot of direction,
but Robbie
did not really get it.
But I love that jumpsuit.
I would wear the hell
out of that jumpsuit.
I love it.
Silence!
I‘ve made my decision.
Bring back my roller girls.
Thorgy Thor.
You‘re safe.
Bob The Drag Queen.
Condragulations, you‘re the
winner of this week‘s challenge.
-Whoo!
-Thank you!
<i>You‘ve one $3,500</i>
<i>of innovative eyewear</i>
<i>from Bradley Kenneth.</i>
Wow!
Ah!
<i>Now all the other girls</i>
<i>can see what I can do.</i>
I feel like everyone knows
I‘m a girl to beat.
Acid Betty.
-You‘re safe.
-Thank you, Mama.
Cynthia Lee Fontaine,
your Ginger Snap was loca,
but the judges were not crazy
about your roller girl.
I‘m sorry, my dear, but you are
up for elimination.
<i>[dramatic percussive tones]</i>
Robbie Turner,
your Macaroon
was not coconut-y enough.
Derrick Barry,
your Ginger Snap
did not snap, crackle, or pop.
Robbie Turner, I‘m sorry,
my dear,
but you are up for
elimination.
Derrick Barry,
you are safe, but...
you better work, bitch.
[chuckles]
Cynthia Lee,
Robbie,
now it‘s your choice.
Do you want to lip sync
in heels or wheels?
Heels.
Wheels.
Ooh.
Two queens stand before me.
Prior to tonight,
you are asked to prepare
a lip sync performance
of "Mesmerized"
by Faith Evans.
Ladies,
this is your last chance
to impress me
and save yourself
from elimination.
<i>[dramatic music]</i>
The time has come...
[thunder rumbles]
For you to lip sync...
for your life.
[echoes]
<i>I deserve to be here.</i>
I‘m not going.
Good luck
and don‘t fuck it up.
<i>["Mesmerized"</i>
<i>by Faith Evans plays]</i>
<i>I‘m the star right now.</i>
<i>Everybody is mesmerized</i>
<i>about my cuckoo and my dance.</i>
<i>Am I the first girl</i>
<i>that‘s ever broken a light</i>
<i>on the runway?</i>
I‘m gonna say yes.
[all scream]
[shouting]
-Yeah!
-Whoo!
[applause]
Ladies,
I‘ve made my decision.
Robbie Turner...
shantay, you stay.
[clapping]
Thank you.
Cynthia Lee Fontaine,
Puerto Rico, Austin,
Santee Alley,
and now the world.
Keep spreading your cuckoo.
Now, sashay away.
I love you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
-[applause]
-Whoo!
-Thank you.
-Love you.
See you soon, mis amores!
<i>-(Cynthia)I feel sad,</i>
<i>but, at the same time,</i>
<i>I don‘t have any regrets.</i>
<i>I would like</i>
<i>to encourage everybody,</i>
<i>don‘t stop believing.</i>
Even if you are the only one
that believes in yourself.
[speaks Spanish]
This is Cynthia Lee Fontaine,
#MisAmoresCuckoo.
Condragulations,
my queens.
Now remember,
if you can‘t love yourself,
how in the hell you gonna love
somebody else?
Can I get a Amen up here?
all: Amen!
All right,
now let the music play.


Hello racers,
and welcome to the starting line
of "RuPaul's Drag Race."
<i>[dramatic music]</i>
Just plug it in and blow.
[imitates blow dryer]
I'm a man in a dress.
Halleloo, ladies.
Drag is not a contact sport.
<i>-We're Heathers.</i>
<i>-Who the fuck is Heather?</i>
Get those nuts
away from my face.
Go back to Party City
where you belong.
Tootsie Lou.
Hi!
Hi, kids!
[clicks tongue]
<i>C'mon season six,</i>
<i>let's get sickening!</i>
<i>-Party.</i>
<i>-Absolutely.</i>
Not today, Satan.
Do you have a smoke?
Can't tease me.
<i>I love my babies.</i>
I'm first!
[RuPaul]<i> Bring back my girls.</i>
<i>[upbeat dance music]</i>
I am Naomi Smalls
and I am 21 years old.
Check your lipstick
before you come for me.
Naomi is a tall glass of water.
She has legs all the way up
to her asshole.
I got my drag name
from Naomi Campbell
and Biggie Smalls.
First one,
I don't blame them.
I'm obsessed
with '90s supermodels.
I'm gonna set myself
right in the center.
Yeah, spotlight on me.
[laughs]
Naomi is a fashion girl.
She's fucking fierce.
<i>[upbeat percussive music]</i>
How you doing mis amores?
Do you want to see my cuckoo?
[laughs]
My name
is Cynthia Lee Fontaine.
How are you?
I'm from Puerto Rico, but
I live in Austin, Texas, y'all.
I call myself between
pageant queen and performer
'cause I do comedy,
I do campy sometimes.
Sometimes?
You know.
[laughs]
I'm sexy as a goddess is
and funny as a clown.
Are you ready for me?
Oh, my God,
the room is huge.
Fantastic,
so my cuckoo have a space.
I need a space
for this junk in the trunk.
[thunder rumbling]
What's up, nerds.
Ah!
<i>My name is</i>
<i>Dax ExclamationPoint</i>
and I am the queen
of all nerds.
It's Storm.
<i>I'm a cosplayer and my look</i>
<i>is very inspired by,</i>
<i>like, science fiction</i>
<i>and comics.</i>
Superheroes.
Just strong, bad bitches
who don't take any crap
from anybody else.
You know what?
I'm gonna sit
'cause my cats are growling.
So I'm just gonna sit
right here.
Okay.
Can I get some brunch?
[laughs]
Hola.
The beauty is here.
<i>My name is Naysha Lopez.</i>
I think the most important
element of my drag
has to be appearance.
<i>It sounds so shallow,</i>
<i>but my drag is flawless.</i>
It's gorgeous, it's stunning,
it's gorgeous, it's everything.
Did I say it was stunning
and gorgeous?
Did I say that already?
Okay.
[both scream]
Naysha is here!
Yes, my sister!
How are you, Mama?
Welcome to season eight,
Mommy.
We made it!
Continental sisters.
She Puerto Rico also,
or from Austin?
I'm originally
from Puerto Rico,
but, um, I live in Chicago.
[whistling]
That's a little frog
in Puerto Rico.
They are so annoying.
<i>I love me some Cynthia.</i>
<i>[whistles]</i>
You don't even understand
what she's saying,
but you don't really care.
[whistles]
<i>[dramatic music]</i>
-Oh!
-Oh!
No need to adjust
your TV sets.
This acid trip is all real.
[cheers]
Watch out bitches.
Here's Acid Betty
from Brooklyn, New York.
<i>My drag style is completely</i>
<i>over-the-top.</i>
Basically, a drug trip
without the drugs.
I kind of want to run around.
[laughs]
The main bullet point
of Acid Betty is she's a bitch.
That's it.
Even Bianca
won't fuck with her.
That's the T.
Wait, I want to put my stink
all over this place.
I'm excited to be here.
Come on, like,
before we all hate each other.
[laughter]
<i>[percussive music]</i>
Good morning.
I didn't realize
this was happening today.
<i>My name is Robbie Turner</i>
and I'm the kindest queen
you'll ever meet.
<i>I'm trying to give</i>
<i>old classic Hollywood.</i>
<i>Rita Hayworth hair,</i>
<i>Jean Harlow robe.</i>
Gorgeous.
How long you been
doing drag for?
Going on 14.
14 years of drag?
I know, can you imagine?
I'm only 12.
You don't look old.
I know I don't.
<i>[futuristic music]</i>
-Yes!
-Oh!
-Yay!
-Oh, Kim Chi!
I came to chop
through the competition.
My name is Kim Chi and
I came here to destroy everyone.
With my makeup.
<i>I'm known for crazy,</i>
over-the-top,
pure anime fantasy.
-Oh, my God.
-[cheering]
Hi, I'm Naomi.
This is beautiful.
<i>Seeing Kim Chi on Instagram</i>
for so long,
double-tapping everything,
I'm fucking star-struck.
I want to go subtle
with everything, so.
<i>I may come across as shy</i>
<i>because I'm soft-spoken,</i>
but "donut" come for me
because I'll destroy you.
Get it, donut?
[laughing]
<i>[upbeat music]</i>
Whoo!
Thorgy with a TH and orgy
and I feel incredible.
My name is Thorgy
and I'm 29 years old.
I'm not 29 years old.
Where did that come from?
I'm colorful, I'm fun,
and I'm a fashion clown.
Whoo!
O-M-baby Jesus.
<i>My drag style</i>
<i>is kind of incredibly eclectic.</i>
<i>I can be campy,</i>
but also I can be,
like, fucking fierce.
[cheers and applause]
-Hi, guys!
-Fuck you, Thorgy.
<i>I know Acid Betty very well.</i>
Lord, it's gonna
be the shit show.
She's gonna be a lot.
She's gonna be extra.
Oh, really?
She's gonna be a diva.
<i>[upbeat dance music]</i>
-Ooh!
-Girl.
NY in the house.
My name is Bob the Drag Queen
and I am 29 years old.
<i>My drag is funny</i>
<i>It's irreverent.</i>
<i>What you see is what you get.</i>
My bodysuit says it all.
You're welcome.
[screaming and cheers]
Yes!
-Take it!
-Yeah!
-[screams]
-Yeah!
I'm hilarious, beautiful,
talented, and humble.
How are you?
Now just one more.
[screaming]
The New York girls,
they get really excited.
And they just talk
over one another.
0Thorgy, you are--
0Whoo!
-Take it.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Too real.
New York, New York,
New York, yeah, girl.
Oh.
<i>Maybe some of</i>
<i>the other queens are, like,</i>
resentful that there's so much
New York City representation.
There's a reason New York City
has some of the best
drag queens in the world
and that is a fact.
This is a gag.
The children don't even know.
[laughter]
All right, ladies.
Let's turn up the juice
and see what shakes loose.
Uh-oh, this is trouble.
Don't say "Beetlejuice"
three times.
I'm Layla McQueen
and I'm 22 years old.
<i>Layla is like a whorey,</i>
<i>quasi-rock star.</i>
I don't want to say gothy,
but like, gothy.
-Hi.
-Hi.
[cheers and applause]
You had the smart idea.
[laughter]
I'm gonna tell you
a story about flats.
No.
14 hours from now,
we're all like, "Ugh, ow!"
She's like Sketchers,
it's the S.
[laughter]
<i>[purposeful piano music]</i>
<i>Laissez les bon temps roulez.</i>
What'd she say?
<i>My name is Chi Chi DeVayne</i>
and I don't get ready,
I stay ready.
-Oh!
-Hey!
My drag is that
real Southern
dragged out style of drag.
Creole fish.
It's like a whole 'nother level
of drag right here.
If you made it to
"RuPaul's Drag Race,"
you made it, honey.
Tell us about yourself.
Well, I'm a cheap queen.
She's on a budget.
Um, I don't mean cheap.
Resourceful.
Yeah, resourceful.
<i>Chi Chi walked in</i>
<i>in a trash bag.</i>
Chi Chi will take herself
out in a trash bag.
<i>[upbeat music]</i>
It's Derrick, bitch.
[cheers and applause]
Yeah!
My name is Derrick Berry.
I'm 32 years old.
<i>I may look angelic,</i>
<i>but I am not that innocent.</i>
<i>I'm a Britney Spears</i>
<i>impersonator.</i>
I impersonate her
six nights a week
on the Las Vegas Strip.
<i>I would love to believe</i>
<i>that I'm the best</i>
<i>Britney in the world.</i>
That's what people say.
Derrick,
I'm so fucking excited.
-Hey!
-How are you?
Derrick Berry
is huge competition.
She is a quasi-celebrity.
-Hey, Derrick, I'm Bob.
-Bob?
There's two boy names here
this season, girl.
Alright, Bob and Derrick.
So, where you from?
Vegas girl.
Vegas girl.
Yeah, so place your bets on me
if you like to gamble.
Is Beyoncé
scared of Britney?
Then Bob ain't scared
of Derrick.
Okay, I want to know
who else did this.
Who else has been
carb-free for two weeks?
[chuckles]
[siren blaring]
-Shut up!
<i>-Ooh, girl!</i>
This is it!
<i>She done already</i>
<i>done had herses.</i>
Let's go!
<i>Welcome, ladies.</i>
[cheers and applause]
<i>Now whether you're</i>
<i>walking children in nature</i>
<i>or feeling the shade of it all,</i>
<i>the time has come for you</i>
<i>to echa, echa, echa pa' lante,</i>
<i>'cause, bitch,</i>
<i>you may be from Chicago</i>
<i>or Cameroon,</i>
<i>but this is not</i>
<i>RuPaul's Best Friend Race.</i>
<i>I have one thing to say.</i>
<i>May I call you Jiggly?</i>
[laughter]
Hello, hello, hello.
[cheers and applause]
Beautiful.
Welcome, ladies.
-Whoo!
-Thank you.
Now, are you ready
to make "herstory"?
[all] Yes!
Well, guess what?
You already have.
This is the 100th episode
of "RuPaul's Drag Race."
[cheers and applause]
Isn't that crazy?
And Derrick Berry,
you are the 100th queen
to prance into this workroom.
-Wow!
-Yes!
-Nice!
-Congratulations.
<i>Oh, my God,</i>
<i>RuPaul just said my name.</i>
Like, freaked out.
<i>I feel like it's a new chapter.</i>
Now there's 1 to 99
and I open a new door with 100.
<i>It's crazy.</i>
Now an occasion
such as this
demands to be acknowledged
on an epic scale.
So I've arranged a photo shoot
with some extra special
guest stars.
I hope you're ready
for your close-up
because if you get upstaged,
this 100th episode
could be your last.
<i>[dramatic music]</i>
<i>The stakes are high.</i>
Nobody wants to be the first
drag queen voted off the island.
Oh, snuff out your candle.
No!
Now, let's go.
<i>The winner</i>
<i>of "RuPaul's Drag Race"</i>
<i>receives</i>
<i>a one-year supply</i>
<i>of Anastasia</i>
<i>Beverly Hills cosmetics</i>
<i>and a cash prize of $100,000.</i>
<i>With extra-special guest judge</i>
<i>Nicole Richie.</i>
<i>[upbeat dance music]</i>
[laughs]
Naysha Lopez,
welcome, darling.
In honor of our
100th episode,
I've gathered the champions
of "RuPaul's Drag Race."
BeBe Zahara Benet.
Tyra Sanchez.
Raja.
Sharon Needles.
Boo.
Chad Michaels.
Jinkx Monsoon.
Violet Chachki.
And Bianca Del Rio...
could not be here
so we just hired a circus clown.
[party horn squeaks]
Oh, my God.
Not really a god,
but close enough.
[laughs]
Now, for your first
photo challenge,
we are going to take
some photographs
with the great Mathu Andersen.
We're gonna find out
if you have what it takes
-to stand amongst greatness.
-Got it.
Going to the challenge,
we're looking for
that spark of individuality
<i>and we want to see</i>
<i>who knows how to get</i>
their cream
to rise to the top.
Face is on lock and go.
Body.
Face.
Naysha Lopez was adorable,
incredible energy
and she seemed quite comfortable
quite quickly.
Why, she's covered
in black cock.
[laughter]
Queens of a feather,
stick together.
Acid Betty, we will see
if you have what it takes
to sit among
the goddesses, all right?
Yes, RuPaul,
very intimidating.
Sitting next to these
wannabe ass drag queens.
<i>[dramatic music]</i>
[camera shutter clicking]
Lovely.
Beautiful.
Acid Betty,
your pussy's on fire.
Chemical fire.
Is that--
Oh, that's your face.
Yes, yes.
I'm surprised
she didn't smack you.
Acid Betty, that one...
you got to watch that one.
<i>Well, you passed</i>
<i>the acid test, Betty.</i>
Naomi Smalls.
-Hi, girl.
-Hey, girl.
-Go big, Naomi Smalls.
-Okay.
<i>[upbeat music]</i>
Oh, all of that right there.
Yeah.
I think Naomi's done this
once or twice.
<i>I have studied thousands</i>
<i>fashion magazines.</i>
Just let me pose and I'm happy.
She has come to model.
<i>Naomi Smalls</i>
<i>looks really hot.</i>
She has a great ass,
great legs,
but she does have cliff hangers.
You see her toes, like,
literally
clinging onto the shoe.
Boner killer.
Show me the winner.
Robbie Turner.
What?
<i>I am very excited</i>
<i>to see Jinkx.</i>
She's my Seattle homegirl.
She's our hometown hero.
-You fucking bitch.
-[laughs] Hi.
Yes, mother.
In walks my sister,
Robbie Turner,
wearing the same wig.
Even though we're sisters,
it's like, who's Beyoncé here?
[clicks tongue]
Let's do this,
one, two, three.
[stammering]
This sleeve happens to be
in my light, darling.
Well, you should move.
[laughter]
Know your place, bitch.
Season eight winner.
Season four winner.
Difference.
Movie star glamour.
Gorgeous.
Welcome to my home.
Thank you, darling.
Sharon, did she try
to come for you?
Oh yeah,
she came for me.
-Hi.
-Come through, Kim Chi.
-Hi girl.
-Oh, my God.
[camera shutter clicking]
Well, you're blocking
Sharon a bit.
Oh, sorry.
-Is she blocking Raja now?
-She's blocking Raja now.
Sorry.
There you go.
What a considerate queen.
Loving Kim Chi.
She's like JuJubee on steroids.
She was kind of giving me anime
and I was loving it.
Yes, give me anime-azing.
Next up, Thorgy Thor,
here we go.
Ah.
It's time for a queen orgy,
Thorgy.
-How 'bout this?
-Oh!
Best smile all day.
[all laugh]
Thorgy's like this fireball
that just came in.
I love her energy
and I think
gonna be
really, really fun.
-Give me something bigger.
-Bigger?
Give me something bigger,
bigger.
No, you just put
your arms up in the air.
-Bigger.
-Bigger.
Oh, okay, yeah.
Grow in size.
Whoo!
[laughter]
<i>Looking good,</i>
<i>feeling Thorgeous.</i>
Chi Chi DeVayne.
-My goodness.
-Garbage.
You have no idea
how many of those dresses
Alaska left at my house.
Really?
Ready to run
with the big dogs?
-I'm ready.
-Get it, trash.
Prove to us
that you're a champion.
I'm gonna
tell you something.
When your skirt covers up
your whole legs
and just leaves two
little feet at the bottom,
it makes me want to laugh,
'cause it looks like you're this
tall with little feet.
[laughter]
Okay, that was my hot tip.
Carry on.
Oh, there she is.
There she is.
Nice.
<i>Pose the house down.</i>
Dax ExclamationPoint.
Get it.
Show me
your exclamation point.
Yay.
Oh.
You've got two left,
so make it happen.
<i>Take it to the Dax.</i>
Next up is Cynthia Lee Fontaine.
Or as I like to call her,
Santially.
Yes!
I'm ready to show my cuckoo
on everything else.
Go.
Model, model for me.
Escandelo.
Prove that you're
a winner, baby.
Gorgeous.
You own everything.
Next,
Bob the Drag Queen.
Little Kim up in the house.
She's trying to keep it
fresh and clean.
Yes.
Slappin' with Raja.
Hey.
[laughter]
Yeah, you got two more left.
I'll just looked shocked.
[laughter]
How about we do like that black
and white photo where no one--
Nice.
Just keeping it editorial,
real and art.
Yes.
Thank you.
I saw the tights
and they were ripped.
Next up, Layla McQueen.
Ready, boom.
Oh, okay.
You remind me of a dog trying
to get comfortable on the couch.
Everyone is so gorgeous
and here I am looking
like a Beetlejuice trash bag
and oh, my God.
<i>It's intimidating for sure.</i>
I can go anywhere?
Yeah, sure, yeah.
Anywhere you want, girl.
Ready, here we go.
Oh, a nice.
She's a shy girl.
<i>Layla McQueen,</i>
I could have used a little more
enthusiasm from her.
She's like the Hamburglar
scurrying around behind people.
[laughter]
<i>Earn those stripes, girl.</i>
From Las Vegas, Nevada,
Derrick Berry.
It's Britney, witch.
[laughs]
That's it,
make them your backup dancers.
Yes, you're gonna work
this whole set, aren't you?
You know it.
Atta girl.
[camera clicking]
-Can I take this?
-Sure, why not.
Yeah.
Yeah, you seem stronger
than yesterday.
Derrick completely used
every last bit of that set
and that's
exactly what you do.
This is the last shot.
Hit me baby, one more time.
Oh, she's toxic.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Whoo.
That was amazing.
Did you guys have fun?
-Whoo!
-Oh, come on, boy Bob.
The de-dragging process
is the most exciting for me
because I want to see what
everybody looks like as a boy
and fuck,
everybody's so cute.
Look at this butch
motherfucker right here.
This is my everyday look, hon.
Layla out of drag,
I want to sleep with.
I like little shorties.
Like, little husky shorties.
Whoo.
Oh, my God, that fucking
Layla's ass is amazing.
I can't help it.
I'm such a top.
<i>[upbeat music]</i>
Betty, I still can't get over
the gag of seeing you here.
I know, I mean, it is because
some people think I'm dead.
Is that based on
how you look or--
It's how I treat people,
so watch yourself.
-Oh.
-Oh.
A lot of the queens are
turning into hens in a henhouse.
They're like,
"Oh, cluck, cluck."
The competition has begun.
<i>[upbeat music]</i>
Ladies,
over the past 99 episodes,
I'm sure you've yelled
at your TV,
"Girl, I coulda slayed
that challenge."
Now it's your chance
to prove it.
For this week's maxi challenge,
each of you will be assigned
a legendary design challenge
from a past season.
It's your job
to take the materials
and make them your own.
To assign the looks,
I'll choose one of your names
at random.
In honor
of the drag classic,
"Priscilla,
Queen of the Desert,"
I've asked Morgan McMichaels
to assume the position.
[cheers and applause]
[laughter]
All right, Morgan,
let 'er rip.
<i>[dramatic percussive music]</i>
[cheers and applause]
All right, the winner is...
Robbie Turner.
[cheers and applause]
Now Robbie, you get to assign
all the queens' looks
and choose your own.
And now, it's time

From season one,

thrift store challenge.
-Ow!
-Yeah!
-Latrice Royale...
-Yes!
Presenting our Pride Float
challenge from season four.
Next, Violet Chachki,
presenting the Money Ball

Ooh.
It's time to assign

All right, Robbie Turner,
who gets Drag on a Dime?
Um, Naysha.
Who gets Float Your Boat?
Naomi.
Who gets Money Ball?
-Acid Betty.
-Wow!
Yes, this is the competition
I came here for.
To show people that I can make
something out of nothing.
<i>That is what I do.</i>
-Next up, Jinkx Monsoon...
-Yes!
Presenting the Sugar Ball
challenge from season 5.
Isn't she sweet?

-Yes.
Who's gonna get a big
Christmas package?
-Derrick Berry.
-Yes.
And Robbie, does this mean
you're going to be doing it
doggie style?
Damn it.
<i>Can you believe I forget</i>
<i>to pick a theme for myself?</i>
Guess who gets stuck
with the poodle?
[sighs]
All right, ladies, well,
you've got some serious
designing to do.
Now if I've said this once,
I've said it 100 times.
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.
<i>[upbeat rock music]</i>
-Yeah!
-All right!
-Oh, my God.
-Let's do it.
All right,
this is kind of interesting.
<i>I'm super excited</i>
<i>about this challenge</i>
because I've watched
every episode
<i>and I can kill</i>
<i>any one of these challenges.</i>
Whoo,
this is fun.
Oh, these are shit bags.
[laughs]
<i>So I'm looking through</i>
<i>my materials</i>
and I realize
that a lot of these things
can't be made into clothing.
<i>Dog chew toys, ropes.</i>
<i>Huh.</i>
Fuck my life.
-You guys, I brought treats.
-[laughs] Dog treats.
It's just a couple of treats,
you know.
Have you ever tasted one of
those for real?
They're actually good.
You know, I'm from the South,
we eat everything, honey.
-Possums, rats, raccoons.
-Possums?
Speaking of,
here's a beaver.
[laughs]
I don't eat beaver.
Oh, too real.
Chi Chi's a fucking bumpkin.
she's just country as fucking
catfish sandwiches.
<i>She's like</i><span style="bodyStyle"> country.</i>
So I get the pride float
challenge
and I got to drag
this big ass boat
for my very first
impression.
How heavy is that?
Bitch, I don't even know
if I can pick this up.
The skinniest,
scrawniest girl.
"Lift this down the runway."
I can hardly lift anything.
<i>How am I going to carry</i>
<i>that on the runway</i>
and still walk as fierce
as Naomi Campbell?
It's like the thing
that covers up
the only thing I love
about my body: my legs.
Shit.
Do brown and green--do they
go together, like those two?
In a challenge about wearing
curtains on your body?
-Yeah.
-Sure.
I got Gone With the Window
and I'm excited
because you get fabric.
It's ugly fabric, but hey, girl,
at least I got fabric.
This is nice.
Why don't you wear
something like that?
-Girl, I'm gonna look naked.
-You would disappear.
I'm gonna look butt naked,
that's why.
-Where did Bob go, girl?
-Where is she?
<i>["12 Days of Christmas"</i>
<i>playing]</i>
There's so much stuff to use.
My theme for the challenge is
The Queen Who Mopped Christmas.
Oh, my God.
[exhales]
My strategy
for this first challenge
is to basically still come out
with my Britney look.
Like, I just want to add to it.
So what kind of vibe
are you going for?
Like,
this Christmas skirt.
Like a tree skirt,
but then I don't know
how to finish a whole outfit.
Girl.
<i>Derrick Berry</i>
<i>is not creative,</i>
obviously because
he's impersonating someone else
<i>his whole life.</i>
He will definitely have
the hardest time
with this challenge.
And I'm like stuck on
what to do for the top.
[groans]
<i>[upbeat music]</i>
<i>The maxi challenge this week</i>
<i>is to design a garment</i>
<i>based on past challenges</i>
that other queens from other
seasons have already done.
My theme is the Hair Ball.
What are you doing?
So, do you remember
the Givenchy collection
with like, the big fur?
-Yes.
-It's inspired by that.
I want to find a way to, like,
celebrate this beige color.
Oh, God,
how can you celebrate that?
This material is going to be
challenging to work with,
<i>especially because</i>
<i>everything I have</i>
is a Florence Henderson
shade of poop brown.
There's so much stuff that I'm
trying not to get overwhelmed
and like, I got this and this
and this and this and this.
I don't do drag on a dime.
<i>I don't sew.</i>
<i>I'm a pageant girl.</i>
<i>I brought so many</i>
<i>beautiful garments.</i>
I spend money.
I don't want to get lost
with all the stuff that I got.
You know what I mean?
There's a fucking piggy bank.
A piggy bank.
Am I supposed to
mount this shit on my head?
Make it work, bitch.
Make it work.
Hello, hello, hello.
[all] Hi.
How's my dirty dozen?
[laughter]
Bob the Drag Queen.
RuPaul.
How did you get
Bob the Drag Queen?
How did that come about?
It's my dad's name.
My dad's name
is The Drag Queen.
[laughs]
It's a family name.
Yeah, Bob stands
for big old bottom, what!
[laughter]
Well, you know it does pay
to advertise.
Now which one did you get?
I got Gone With the Window.
Now do you know how to sew?
I'm not, like,
the world's best sewer,
but I know how
to slap a garment together.
So, you're not
the world's greatest sewer.
What are you
the world's greatest?
I'm a stand-up comedian.
Who's your competition?
You know, Ru, I don't want
to sound so, uh, stereotypical.
Do, do it, it's between us.
I don't--
I don't have competition
because no one here
does what I do.
I learned from listening
to your podcast
with you and Michelle,
that there really is no reason
to pretend to be modest.
I'm fucking funny.
I'm really funny.
Let the world know.
First name, Bob,
last name, The Drag Queen.
Can she turn it?
Yes, she can.
[laughing]
It's true, girl.
All right, I'm gonna let you
get back to work.
-Thank you, Ru. Thank you.
-All right.
-Acid Betty.
-RuPaul.
How you doing?
I'm gagging
that you just said my name.
I'm so honored to be here.
Yes, now tell me about
the Brooklyn drag scene.
Well, some of them are here.
Thorgy Thor is here.
Are you guys friends
or are you friendly rivals?
We're definitely friends.
We've never worked together.
I actually haven't worked with
a lot of queens in Brooklyn
because I mostly work
in Manhattan.
-Is that a read?
-It could be.
[laughter]
Describe for me
what Brooklyn drag is.
Technically, I guess,
Brooklyn drag right now
is unpolished,
um, hairy,
so I try and elevate myself
and shave my beard.
Uh-huh, all right.
Now, what challenge did you get?
The Money Ball.
Right, do you know how to sew?
I do, but this is, like,
paper and glue.
Now, I don't see
any paper or glue yet.
So I'm trying to build
a base first
and then attach the paper,
the money to it.
Right.
All right, I'm gonna let you
get back to work.
Thank you, RuPaul.
Layla McQueen.
What's going on, lady?
-Which challenge did you get?
-I got the Rupocalypse.
Rupocalypse!
So what do you have planned?
Um, I was given, like,
a few plastic hands
and then like, a shit-ton
of camouflage.
I think camouflage
is a disgusting component
of human culture.
Okay, yeah.
Um, I'd really like to play
with the whole, like,
deconstruction, like,
jagged shapes and like...
Um...
-Rough around the edges.
-Yeah.
Now tell me,
how are you feeling?
You seem a little shy.
I am and we started
this day kind of...
It was--it was all--
it was a lot.
But now, I'm, like,
getting into the groove.
Well, listen, you better
get your shit together
because there's some
very competitive girls here.
Oh, good.
All right, Layla,
I can't wait to see it.
Thanks.
All right, listen up, ladies.
Tomorrow on the main stage,
we'll decide
how you measured up.
Good luck
and don't fuck it up.
All right.
Oh, my God.
Timing is not my friend
right now.
Now I get why girls
have emotional breakdowns.
Amen.
Everyone is freaking out
because in the back of
everyone's mind,
while they're working
on their outfits,
is, "Fuck, I do not want
to go home first."
<i>[dramatic music]</i>
<i>[upbeat music]</i>
Whoo, we're back.
Hello, couture.
This thing is too big.
And that's not normally
a complaint.
Today is our very first runway
and everyone is just trying
to get their shit done.
So I'm not the
only one stressing.
And I'm burning myself,
and I'm burning myself,
and I'm burning myself.
Well stop burning yourself
and shut up.
Did you have to change
anything?
Nothing major,
but I made this clutch,
which I'm very proud of.
Oh, my God.
It is a known fact that
a lady do carry a bag to dinner.
This purse is hideous,
but I'm using it.
I think it goes
with the look though.
That was shade!
No!
I think it's cute.
Kim, you are shady.
I'm not,
I think it's cute.
Get away from me,
Shade Chi.
I actually
do a lot of pageants,
and I won this pageant.
It's an international pageant.
It's called Miss Continental
and it is one of
the most prestigious pageants.
I've heard of it.
Yeah, so I'm
a former Miss Continental.
-That's awesome.
-Yeah.
I hate pageants.
Girl, I've done,
like, two pageants.
And you didn't win them and
that's why you hate pageants.
Exactly.
I knew it.
I knew it.
That always happens to someone
who don't win.
Bitch, I was robbed.
Like, to me, pageants are all
about the who's who of drag.
You know how many people
who would tell me,
"You're not gonna
win the pageant.
Why are you wasting your money?
Why are you doing that?"
Yeah, but you're gambling,
you're gambling your money.
Anything you do is a gamble,
remember that.
Are you really living
if you're like,
"Well, I'm not going to do it
because I don't know
the outcome."
Really?
This is the thing,
you don't have to compromise
who you are when you do stuff.
You get what I'm saying?
Be you.
It just sucks that pageants
get such a bad rap.
<i>I owe a whole lot</i>
<i>of my work ethic</i>
<i>and who I am</i>
<i>to pageant experiences.</i>
You've given me
a different outlook on pageants,
but, girl,
I still hate them.
[laughs]
So, Derrick, how long have
you been doing Britney?
I started on Halloween 2003.
And how long
you been doing drag?
Halloween 2003.
<i>I've been doing Britney</i>
<i>for 12 years</i>
and I think a lot of other girls
are not going to think I can do
anything else,
<i>and maybe the judges even.</i>
I have to prove
that I can do more than Britney.
I've found
there's two breeds of queen.
There's Halloween queens
and there's pride queens.
-I was a pride queen.
-Really?
I, like, started drag
on Gay Pride wearing,
like, shitty potato sack
and a wig from, you know,
who knows where.
Was that this Pride?
-How dare you?
-[laughter]
Oh you little bitch,
how dare you.
Oh, Layla!
It's all fun and jokes until
someone gets sent home, girl.
Mm-mm.
No, ma'am.
How long have you
been doing drag?
I've been doing drag
for two and a half years.
Does your family
support your drag?
My family doesn't know
that I do drag.
-They don't know?
-Really?
-No.
-At all?
Like, my mom thinks
I'm a makeup artist.
Has your mother ever seen you
in drag ever,
like pictures or anything?
Well, I've shown her pictures
of me in drag
and she thinks they're, like,
makeup jobs that I did.
She doesn't recognize
that it's me.
-Stop.
-Really?
Yeah.
<i>I guess I'm worried about</i>
<i>my mom finding out</i>
that I did drag
because growing up,
I always felt like I could
never be a model child
that all Asian mothers want.
I've already disappointed her
so many times in her life.
She could even stop
talking to me.
And...
And you know, I'm just scared
of letting her down again.
What foundation
do you like to use?
Girl, like,
somebody gave me this.
And they was just like,
"This look like your color."
So, I'm like, "Okay."
-How long you been in drag?
-Five years.
And you're not
brand loyal yet?
No ma'am, I use whatever
cost a dollar or free.
[laughing]
I want to be like
the Anna Wintour of drag.
Wait, if you're the Nomi,
then, uh,--who does that--
am I the older one
in "Showgirls"?
I'm Naomi, not Nomi.
Oh, then that's perfect.
Come on, Naomi Shambles.
Work the runway, girl.
Naomi Shambles
on the runway, girl.
Knees clackin',
clickity clackin, boom.
-God, Bob and his mouth.
-He is like madness.
-I love it.
-Do you really?
He's like a talking head.
When I'm trying
to concentrate,
I really don't need,
like, someone
trying to, like, crack
one-liners all the time.
Especially when
they're not always funny.
Well, he's a comedian,
which means I say 300 jokes,
four of them are funny.
I guess, like I'm just used
to, like, getting ready
with girls who's just like,
loud and like, you know.
And see, I get ready alone.
Y'all know we ain't got
no insurance, now sit down.
[fabric rips]
[gasps]
What's the matter girl?
Speak it out.
I go to put on my outfit
and what happens?
Pop.
My outfit has just ripped apart.
Oh, God,
I'm having a meltdown.
[sewing machine buzzing]
Uh, that don't work.
This some bullshit.
<i>My fucking panties</i>
<i>just ripped at the last second.</i>
<i>And it's all coming apart.</i>
This fabric,
for some reason,
will not catch
the bottom thread.
This is some bullshit.
Shit.
I am going into panic mode
right now.
<i>Girl, you cannot go home,</i>
<i>not on the first day.</i>
I want this so freaking bad.
Like, I'm so distraught,
I don't even know
what I'm doing now.
I have no clue
how she's gonna fix this outfit.
<i>I think she's done.</i>
I hope you know
the lip synch song,
'cause your outfit
is crumbling before your hands.
Fuck.
<i>["Cover Girl"</i>
<i>by RuPaul plays]</i>
<i>And what.</i>
[laughter]
Welcome to the main stage
of "RuPaul's Drag Race."
Michelle Visage,
happy 100th.
Happy birthday,
gorgeous.
Style superstar,
Carson Kressley.
You look amazing for 100.
I know, I don't look
a day over 95.
-Thank you Doctor Zizmor.
-Yes.
[laughs]
And the straight-talking
Ross Mathews.
Now, on a scale from one to 100,
how excited are you?
Like, a dragzillion.
And the fabulous
Nicole Richie.
-Hey, kitty girl.
-Hi, gorge.
Your dress is very
"Wizard of Oz."
Are you a good witch
or a bad witch?
-Or a sandwich.
-[laughter]
This week, our queens posed
with Drag Race champions.
And tonight,
they're debuting
their own creations
based on a design challenge
from the "anals"
of "RuPaul's Drag Race."
Michele,
did I say that right?
-Eh.
-Eh, close enough.
Gentlemen, start your engines
and may the best woman win.
<i>[upbeat music]</i>
[RuPaul] First up, Acid Betty,
Money Ball.
Well,
bitch better have my money.
<i>I do freaky drag</i>
<i>and I think I do it the best.</i>
<i>The drag scene should not</i>
<i>be homogenized</i>
<i>and not everyone</i>
<i>should look the same.</i>
<i>Therefore, Acid Betty</i>
<i>is here to represent.</i>
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
make it rain.
[Nicole] Don't you love
when you just find a dollar
in your dress pocket?
-[Carson] Yes.
-Didn't know this was here.
[RuPaul] Cash is queen,
I own everything.
Bob the Drag Queen,
Gone with The Window.
[Carson] Yes, honey,
lead with the bag.
I love it.
<i>This outfit shows</i>
<i>that I have the ability</i>
<i>to make a finished garment.</i>
<i>The fabric is hideous, but</i>
<i>the construction is everything.</i>
<i>I'm living my dream with this</i>
<i>ugly purse that I made.</i>
[Ross] No shade,
but that dress looks like
it was made out of curtains.
[Nicole] It's very
Butterfly McQueen.
[Michelle] Frankly my dear,
I don't give a dental damn.
[RuPaul] Dax ExclamationPoint,
Hello Kitty.
[Carson] Hello, Herve Leger.
-[Michelle] Hello, Angeline.
-[Ross] Meow.
<i>This outfit</i>
<i>is totally me.</i>
<i>I love Hello Kitty.</i>
<i>Anything a 12-year-old Asian</i>
<i>girl wants, I want it more.</i>
<i>I feel like a neon '80s</i>
<i>nightmare and I love it.</i>
[Carson] I do love a pink pussy.
[Nicole] It's better than
a purple one.
[Carson] Why it got
to be purple?
[RuPaul] Naysha Lopez,
Drag on a Dime.
[Nicole] Fashion sure
is changing.
<i>I am serving Greek goddess,</i>
<i>giving you face for the gods.</i>
<i>Face, body, glamour.</i>
<i>And I am definitely serving</i>
<i>that all right now.</i>
[Michelle] Peek-a-Ru, I see you.
[RuPaul] Uh-huh.
[Michelle] A dress that
makes cents. Not dollars.
[RuPaul] A dollar
make me holler.
Kim Chi, Hair Ball.
-[clears throat]
-[laughs]
You got a little--
[Michelle] Someone's in a furry.
<i>I've made a lion outfit</i>
<i>inspired by Givenchy.</i>
<i>I turned these ratty,</i>
<i>dirty blonde wigs</i>
<i>into a golden treasure.</i>
<i>This outfit is big, grand,</i>
<i>and conceptual.</i>
<i>It's Kim Chi.</i>
[Nicole] She stepped
that pussy up. Meow.
[RuPaul] Cynthia Lee Fontaine,
Sugar Ball.
[Michelle] Gumdrop it
like it's hot.
<i>I feel like a goddess</i>
<i>of the snow.</i>
<i>My "corselet"</i>
<i>is just sickening.</i>
<i>It's sugar, azúcar.</i>
<i>Are you ready for my cuckoo?</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>
<i>-[all] Yes.</i>
[RuPaul] Now see, that's
the real sugar right there.
[Nicole] She's serving cake.
[Michelle] That's her
sugar walls.
[Nicole] Whoa!
[RuPaul] Naomi Smalls,
Float Your Boat.
[Carson] Washington's
cross-dressing the Delaware.
[Nicole] She has
my dream chest.
[Carson] Yeah.
<i>I'm trying to give you</i>
<i>'90s supermodel walk</i>
<i>and this boat is covering</i>
<i>half of it.</i>
<i>When I can finally</i>
<i>step out of this boat,</i>
<i>that's when the judges</i>
<i>can really see</i>
<i>the true Naomi Smalls.</i>
[Carson] Land ho.
<i>I am giving you</i>
<i>Naomi Campbell</i>
<i>strutting down</i>
<i>a Versace runway.</i>
[Michelle] Legzilla.
[Ross] Oh, oh that, yeah.
That boat looks heavy.
Are there any seamen
to help her?
[Michelle] Where are they?
[Ross] The seamen
are all below deck.
[RuPaul] Chi Chi DeVayne,
Glitter Ball.
[Carson] You know I always say,
when life hands you
disco balls...
-[Nicole] Oh.
-[Carson] What do you do?
[Michelle] You make an outfit.
[all laughing]
[Ross] Yeah.
<i>After my little meltdown,</i>
<i>I'm just gonna roll</i>
<i>with the punches</i>
<i>and I'm really feeling this</i>
<i>disco queen kind of vibe.</i>
<i>It's a dream come true.</i>
[Ross] That's a disco ball?
I thought that
was a fabulous globe.
-[Carson] Yes.
-[Ross] It's her ring.
[Carson] I thought it was
a Judith Leiber bag.
-[RuPaul] Cocktail bag.
-[Carson] Balls to the walls.
[RuPaul] Thorgy Thor,
Red Velvet Cake Couture.
[Michelle] I'm hungry
for that creamy middle.
[Nicole] This is feeling
a little menstrual.
[all laughing]
[RuPaul] I'm glad you said it
and I didn't.
<i>I don't wear gowns,</i>
<i>but for this challenge</i>
<i>I just wanted to feel decadent</i>
<i>and I still kept</i>
<i>with my cartoon hair,</i>
<i>giving you cream cheese</i>
<i>realness.</i>
[Michelle] Oh, happy birthday!
[RuPaul] Have her cake
and serve it too.
Robbie Turner,
Bitch Ball.
Who let the dogs out?
[Nicole] I love two bitches
on a runway.
<i>I think I'm looking more like</i>
<i>a sheep than a poodle.</i>
<i>The dog is looking at me like,</i>
<i>"Get me the fuck</i>
<i>out of here."</i>
<i>I'm looking at the dog like,</i>
<i>"Get</i><span style="bodyStyle"> me</i><i> the fuck</i>
<i>out of here."</i>
<i>This is not going well.</i>
[RuPaul] Bow wow wow.
[Michelle] Yippee yo,
yippee yay.
[Ross] I give this look about
a canine out of 10.
[RuPaul] Uh-huh, she's fade
and she's throwing shade.
[Michelle] Those bitches
are over it.
[RuPaul] Derrick Berry,
The Queen Who Mopped Christmas.
[Ross] Well, hey, y'all.
<i>I'm giving you</i>
<i>Christmas in Vegas.</i>
<i>I'm representing showgirls.</i>
<i>I'm serving body.</i>
<i>But I'm also giving comedy.</i>
-[all] Whoa!
-[Ross] Ho, ho, ho.
[Nicole] She's trimming
her bush.
[RuPaul] Is that mistletoe
or camel toe.
[Nicole] I respect that.
[Carson] She's putting
the X back in Xmas.
[RuPaul] Yes, she is.
[Ross] Oops,
she's doing it again.
[RuPaul] Layla McQueen,
Apocalyptic Couture.
Now, her pussy's not on fire,
but her shoulder is.
<i>This look</i>
<i>is classic Layla.</i>
<i>I'm loving this cute</i>
<i>little jacket I made.</i>
<i>I'm giving you, like,</i>
<i>a post-apocalyptic,</i>
<i>like, devil commander, like,</i>
<i>she's coming up,</i>
<i>the world is over</i>
<i>and I'm here to take over.</i>
[Michelle] The thigh's
the limit.
[RuPaul] Layla McQueen,
Beyond Thunderdome.
Welcome, ladies.
I feel like I just saw my whole
life flash before my eyes.
[laughter]
Now, ladies, when I call
your name, please step forward.
Bob the Drag Queen.
Dax ExclamationPoint.
Cynthia Lee Fontaine.
Chi Chi DeVayne.
Thorgy Thor.
You are all...
Safe.
Thank you.
And for the 100th time,
safe is not a word I associate
with America's Next
Drag Superstar.
Now you may leave the stage.
Time for the judges critiques.
Ladies, you represent the tops
and the bottoms of the week.
Now it's time
for the judges critiques.
Acid Betty.
I love that you're different.
Every inch was kind of
covered with a thought.
To me,
that's what drag is about.
And then the photo,
<i>you seem like you're a little</i>
<i>bit more of the avant-garde,</i>
artsy, like, you're giving me
Tunnel 1993.
-I was there.
-I might've seen you there.
-You might've.
-Great job.
Thank you Acid Betty.
Next up, Naysha Lopez.
-You're gorgeous.
-Thank you.
You're giving me Eva Longoria,
Miss America.
Your makeup is stunning.
I think, Naysha,
you're beautiful,
but when you're part
of an ensemble photo,
<i>you really want to stand out.</i>
The dark hair and the dark top,
I don't think it works
in this picture.
I have a pet peeve
with seeing undergarments.
So when you turn around
I see illusion net.
Give me the full illusion.
That big gold piece
just makes you look thick
and I just don't think
it looks good.
This is actually the first
garment I've ever made.
I don't really sew.
I felt like it was wearable
and, you know,
I got the challenge down.
All right, well,
thank you very much.
-Next up, Kim Chi.
-Hi.
Your photo is pretty fabulous.
And I really like
your runway look.
You are giving me, like,
this Cowardly Lion
anime ferociousness.
I think it totally worked.
The artistry on your face
is just like geometric orgasm.
I'm gonna give you
the benefit of the doubt
and say the walk
was a character choice.
Every time I'm wearing
something different,
I'm living whatever fantasy
of the outfit I've got going on.
In my personal eyes,
I'm an anime character
who works
as a high fashion model.
You're just a total nerd.
-I am.
-I love that.
And by the way, I like that
you kept your areolas bald.
The breasts are the windows
to the soul, for sure.
[laughter]
Nicole,
would you wear this?
I would definitely
wear it.
Where would you wear this?
Um, probably school drop off.
Okay, yeah.
Thank you, Kim Chi.
Next up, Naomi Smalls.
I love that you
are rocking a boy chest.
You're giving me
like, '70s "Studio 54."
Michele,
how do you like her hair?
Very pretty, only
my hairline's not clockable.
Okay, all right.
The Pride Float
was beautifully decorated,
but it became really cumbersome.
And I almost saw you thinking,
"I have to get back in that boat
and strap it on."
And I'm saying that
about the boat.
Yeah, I know, how many times
have you said that in your life?
-Girl.
-Yeah.
But the picture.
Hello?
And it's a big butt.
That is a big butt.
I believe they call that
serving it.
Okay.
That needs to come through
with everything that you do,
whether you're dragging a
50-pound boat with you or not.
Next up,
Robbie Turner.
Your photo, I loved,
because you're giving me kind of
funny glamour there.
-You chose fur?
-It's like a fringe.
Fringy kind of
carpety-looking stuff.
You're literally a blob.
We lose all shape and
from the side, it's even worse.
And you got to choose
your challenge.
I actually forgot that I--
to choose one for myself.
I didn't have
my '40s dress pattern,
but I was trying to figure
it out, like,
at the last minute.
So, it was like a series
of misfortunate events.
Do you think that you deserve
to be in the bottom.
Um, no, I think
my personality is winning.
All right, well, thank you
very much, Robbie Turner.
Next up, Derrick Berry.
Your look tonight,
it's adorable.
I will say it's pretty simple.
I like the comedic moment
where you trimmed
your holiday bush.
I love a bush
on the front door,
but on the back door
not so much.
-No.
-Definitely not berries.
[laughter]
And then your photo,
like, everyone in this photo
looks like
they're your backup dancers
and you're the star.
-Wow.
-We've seen Britney now.
My personal challenge to you
is to show me everything else
but Britney.
-Okay.
-We love your Britney.
I do want to see more of it,
but we do want to see
other things.
I want more!
And I'll give you more.
[laughter]
You can't help yourself,
can you?
Up next,
Layla McQueen.
-Hi, Layla.
-Hey, bitch.
I love the shoulder detail.
Did you sew that?
I sewed the jacket, yes.
-That's pretty impressive.
-Thank you.
But I felt like the bottom
half was just a cop out.
This was a really fun category
I think to like,
do, like,
totally, like, singe.
To me, it's just like,
Wynonna Judd opened the oven
too quickly and got
a little, like, you know,
burnt on the outside.
In the picture we lose you
crumpling up into a ball.
You're with all these
kind of legendary people
and it's almost like your
body's saying "I'm not worthy."
<i>[dramatic music]</i>
Do you think
that your missteps
would warrant you
in the bottom?
I think I have
a lot more to show
and I don't think that I am...
the least put together.
Who do you think
is the least put together?
I think Naomi.
Her look is very plain.
Do you agree with that,
Naomi?
No. I tried to take something
that was from a past season
and make it new and fresh.
Well, thank you, ladies.
I think we've heard enough.
While you untuck backstage,
the judges
and I will deliberate.
<i>[tense music]</i>
Alright now, just between
us squirrel friends,
what do you think?
Let's start with Acid Betty.
I love Acid Betty.
she's a little bit dangerous,
she's rock 'n' roll.
In the photo she looks great,
but she is this punk girl.
Like, give me
a little screaming...
Ahh!
Tongue out punkness.
I don't hate her photo,
and like her name implies,
she's kind of a trip
and she's a little East Village.
Well, you know, I did
a lot of antacid in the 60s
and I think that Acid Betty
really represents that.
[laughter]
<i>[RuPaul]: Alright,</i>
<i>Naysha Lopez.</i>
Her photo, unfortunately,
I think she got lost.
And also,
don't stand on that stage
and tell us
it's the first dress you made.
I mean, this is not the place
you make your first dress.
-Girl.
-You make your first dress
when you learn that
you're gonna come on the show.
Or you make them
when your mom's at work
-and you're in the sixth grade.
-[all laughs]
<i>[RuPaul] All right, next up,</i>
<i>Kim Chi.</i>
I love the photograph.
<i>She was kind of</i>
<i>the queen of the castle</i>
<i>in this anime jungle.</i>
Everything about her tonight
made me happy,
except for
that lumbering walk.
Right, because
she was serving a little bit
of Sasquatch on the runway.
Sasquatch that walk.
You can say Yeti that walk.
Yeti that walk.
[laughter]
<i>Next up, Naomi Smalls.</i>
I love that she looks like
she might faint at any moment.
All I saw
was a really tiny thing
<i>lumbering with</i>
<i>a heavy ass boat.</i>
I kind of like
the contrast of her like,
fumbling with the boat.
It's like a cartoon of an ant
carrying a giant piece
of cheese.
[chuckles] Yeah.
<i>[Ross] Well, that's the picture</i>
<i>of the day.</i>
<i>It says,</i>
<i>"bow down bitches."</i>
If she doesn't bring
the photo her
to this her,
to me, she's gone.
<i>Moving on down</i>
<i>to Robbie Turner.</i>
This look in her photo
is probably her go to look.
<i>It's that Carole Lombard</i>
<i>meets Carol Burnett.</i>
<i>Superstar from the 20s.</i>
But what we saw today
was basic.
Yes, she said
she forgot to choose
a category for herself.
The dog ate my category.
A dingo ate my category.
Quite honestly,
if she put any creativity
into that,
she could've turned it out
and that's a shame
because I like
what I saw in the picture.
Let's move on down
to Derrick Berry.
Her Britney is amazing.
You know he can nail
the Britney thing.
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>the photo was phenomenal.</i>
I'm glad she brought
it the first episode.
Now bring Derrick Berry
to the table.
But don't you want to see
a little bit more Britney?
Yes,
we'll get more Britney.
<i>Layla McQueen.</i>
She did the most
basic bottom half to that.
I expect so much more.
This is season eight and
the bar has been raised so high.
There was just
nothing standing out for me.
The worst picture
of the week, by far,
but I find her interesting
because she is an artist.
That warrants
a second chance to me.
Silence.
I've made my decision.
Bring back my girls.
<i>[dramatic music]</i>
Acid Betty,
you put your money
where your mouth is
and where your ass is
-and where your chest is.
-[laughter]
-You're safe.
-Thank you.
Kim Chi, your photo
and main stage presentation
wigged us out.
Condragulations, you're the
winner of this week's challenge.
-[cheering]
-Oh, my God.
You've won $3,000
from selfieonastick.com.
The original and the best
selfie on a stick.
-Say hi, everybody.
-Cheese.
I can be the Asian tourist
that I've always wanted to be.
Bitch,
I just won $3,000.
<i>This win means I have a place</i>
<i>in this competition</i>
and I am a force
to be reckoned with.
<i>[upbeat music]</i>
Derrick Berry, you're safe.
[whispers] Thank you.
Naomi Smalls, you're safe.
[silent]
<i>[tense music]</i>
Naysha Lopez,
you are gorgeous,
-Thank you.
-but...
The judges felt short changed
by your Drag on a Dime.
I'm sorry my dear, but you are
up for elimination.
<i>[dramatic music]</i>
<i>[Naysha] I am absolutely</i>
<i>gagging.</i>
I don't deserve
to be in the bottom two.
<i>You have some queen</i>
<i>rocking this five dollar dress.</i>
I-I don't get it.
Robbie Turner,
your photo was iconic,
but on the main stage,
you screwed the pooch.
Layla McQueen,
you are an edgy artist,
but your photo and your
Post Apocalyptic Couture
were not earth shattering.
Robbie Turner...
You're safe.
-Oh.
-All right.
Wow.
Layla McQueen,
I'm sorry my dear,
but you are up for
elimination.
My heart drops,
but I'm not gonna be
the first one to go home.
I'm gonna do every kind of
quasi-gimmick I have.
Two queens stand before me.
Ladies,
this is your last chance
to impress me
and save yourself
from elimination.
<i>[dramatic music]</i>
The time has come...
[thunder rumbles]
For you to lip synch
for your life.
[thunder rumbles]
Good luck
and don't fuck it up.
<i>[upbeat music]</i>
<i>Naysha is always giving</i>
<i>like, beautiful, sexy,</i>
J.Lo boom shell,
I feel it.
Layla is giving you
sex on a stick and it's awesome.
<i>She is looking</i>
<i>so good right now</i>
<i>throwing her body</i>
<i>all over the floor.</i>
<i>Naysha's dancing</i>
<i>like a soccer mom.</i>
"You can get the ball in
the goal, kids, you can do it."
[cheering]
Good job! Yes!
Ladies,
I've made my decision.
<i>[dramatic music]</i>
Layla McQueen,
shantay, you stay.
You may join the other girls.
Thank you.
Naysha Lopez,
out of 100 queens,
you are by far one
of the most beautiful
-to grace this stage.
-Thank you, Ru.
And I'm sorry
to see you go so soon.
I'm sorry that I wasn't
able to show you
everything that I had to offer.
Thank you, Ru,
for this opportunity.
Thank you.
Now, sashay away.
<i>[somber music]</i>
Now, good luck with
all these monsters, Mary.
[laughter]
<i>[Naysha] I am first to go and I</i>
<i>feel like I didn't let Ru see</i>
what I'm all about because
there's so much more to me.
<i>Ru, I want to thank you</i>
<i>for the platform</i>
<i>that you have given me</i>
because not everyone
appreciates it.
<i>I thank you for that</i>
from the bottom
of my heart.
Well,
condragulations, ladies,
and remember,
if you can't love yourself,
how in the hell you gonna
love somebody else?
Can I get an amen in here.
[all] Amen.
Alright,
now let the music play.


<i>-Previously on</i>
<i>"RuPaul's Drag Race"...</i>
Last week,
double elimination
left a void that
I've decided to fill with...
-Bitches, I'm back!
Yeah!
-Naysha Lopez.
For this week's maxi challenge,
you'll be acting
in "RuCo's Empire."
-Whoo!
both: Action.
-This.
[laughter]
This.
[laughter]
-I'm a strong,
gay woman!
-Okay.
-Please, sir, empty your--
[gibberish]
Please, ma'am, will you empty
your pocketbook?
Gah!
-I feel like you're coming out
and these clothes
are wearing you.
I'd love to see you show me
that you do have soul.
-Bob The Drag Queen,
condragulations,
you're the winner
of this week's challenge.
Robbie Turner,
shantay, you stay.
Cynthia Lee Fontaine,
sashay away.
<i>[dramatic music]</i>
-Whoo!
Uh-uh!
-Aw.
-Cucu.
<i>-Cynthia just got eliminated.</i>
My continental Puerto
Rican sister's gone.
I'm really sad.
-"Don't give up.
Love you."
Isn't the sweetest?
I can't wait to see her again.
-You want her to come
back then?
-Derrick,
let's not get crazy.
[laughter]
-Cynthia is so loveable,
but girl,
that may have been
the worst outfit
in "Drag Race" history.
Alyssa, you're safe.
<i>And those fucking</i>
<i>jogging shorts she had on?</i>
<i>Red stockings?</i>
<i>Going out looking like</i>
<i>Sofia Vergara's</i>
<i>less fortunate cousin,</i>
the one she don't
send money to.
-I think it was legendary
that you freaking did
a lip-synch
for your life with skates.
-Well--
-Bitch, you killed
that shit.
-Actually, I'm feeling shaken
in this competition right now,
and the thing
that I know I can do--
acting,
I fail at?
I'm feeling
really disappointed in myself.
-I think I got good critiques,
like, we're seeing
something different,
but then I got told
from Michelle
that I don't
really have a soul.
-Michelle said
you don't have soul.
She didn't say
you don't have a soul.
-Then I'll
just start twerking.
Come on,
berry bootie challenge.
Is that my soul?
Come on, berry bootie.
-They don't want you to be--
-Girl,
she ain't getting it.
-Betty has soul.
-This is Betty's character
that she created.
-What you don't realize is
Betty doesn't have a character.
This is just Betty.
-Yeah, you really
need to find, like, who you are.
-That's not Britney Spears.
<i>-I still don't get a sense</i>
<i>of who Derrick Barry is</i>
<i>as a drag queen,</i>
aside from the fact that
he does Britney impersonation.
<i>He needs to find ways to</i>
take his drag much further.
-[laughs]
<i>-That could be a big problem</i>
<i>for Derrick as we move forward,</i>
and we're moving forward,
honey.
The train's pulling out
of the station.
<i>[train whistle blows]</i>
-Oops, I did it again.
<i>[dramatic music]</i>
<i>[car engine starts]</i>
<i>-The winner</i>
<i>of "RuPaul's Drag Race"</i>
<i>receives a one-year supply</i>
<i>of Anastasia</i>
<i>Beverly Hills cosmetics</i>
<i>and a cash prize</i>
<i>of $100,000.</i>
<i>With extra special</i>
<i>guest judges,</i>
<i>Lucian Piane,</i>
<i>and Blondie,</i>
<i>Chris Stein and Debbie Harry.</i>
<i>[upbeat music]</i>
-Hey, everyone.
[laughter]
Walk into the room
purse first.
Purse first. Purse first.
Purse first.
Ah, walk into
the room purse first. Clack!
[alarm sounds]
all: Ooh!
<i>-Ooh, girl, she done</i>
<i>already done had herses.</i>
-Hey, rock lobsters.
-all: Hey!
<i>-One way or another,</i>
<i>you've got to rock the Casbah,</i>
<i>and when the tide is high,</i>
<i>girl,</i>
<i>I know what boys like.</i>
<i>Boys like me.</i>
<i>[giggles]</i>
-What?
-Hello, hello, hello.
[all cheer]
Now long before I became
supermodel of the world,
I was in a punk rock band
called Wee Wee Pole.
-[laughs]
-Ha-ha!
<i>I was inspired by bands</i>
<i>like the B-52s...</i>
-Yeah!
-Wendy O. Williams...
-Whoo!
-And my all-time favorite...
-Blondie.
-all: Yes!
-Now for this week's
Maxi Challenge,
you're going to form
your own new wave band.
[cheering]
#NewWaveQueens.
-Hey.
-Working in teams of three,
you'll be writing lyrics
to original retro tracks.
You need to create
a unique style
using clothes, shoes,
and accessories
provided by
Out of the Closet thrift stores.
And tomorrow, in front
of an audience of groupies,
you'll be performing live.
Now I'm gonna let you all
form your own band.
<i>[dramatic music]</i>
Anarchy!
[laughter]
-I love these bitches.
This is our team.
Team Best Friend Race.
-You want to do New York?
-Oh.
-Yeah!
-Team New York.
<i>-The third team</i>
<i>just seems like</i>
leftovers
just formed together.
-Now there are three
different tracks:
punk, synth, and party,
and I'll let you guys
figure out who gets what.
And on the runway,
the category is neon realness.
[all cheer]
Gentlemen,
start your engines,
and may the best woman rock!
[cheering]
-All right,
let's make a case.
-We want punk.
<i>-Kim, Robbie,</i>
<i>and I choose punk</i>
because we don't want
to give the judges
something
they've seen before.
We want to
really rough it up.
-We want party.
-And we also want party.
[together]
We also want party.
-Okay, let's everyone
in their group
individually say what you want.
-I definitely,
definitely want party.
-Party.
-Party.
Party. And what do you guys
want in your group.
-Party.
-I want party.
-Synth.
'Cause it has soul,
it has rhythm.
-See, and I felt like
that about this.
-Now I will say this group
is unanimous on party,
and you guys
are not unanimous on party.
-Oops!
[laughs]
-There's, like,
this turmoil between
<i>Chi Chi and his group,</i>
so we kind of, like,
pit them against each other.
-I just don't
want you guys to fight.
I don't want
Chi Chi to be upset.
-I genuinely don't think
that your group
will be as strong
with this
'cause you were like,
"I want synth."
You got to turn 'em
against themselves.
[evil laugh]
[coughs]
Just get some water.
So what
are you guys thinking?
-We're gonna go with synth,
and you guys go with party.
-All right.
Thank you so much.
<i>-Derrick and I,</i>
<i>being team players,</i>
decide we're
gonna go with synth.
Let's make it work.
-Girl, we are art.
-That's fine.
You can be art.
-Art, art, art,
art, art.
Art, art,
shekat-kat-boom.
Oh,
shika-kat-kat-ki-kat.
Art,
did somebody mention art?
-I hope
that's not their song.
If that's their song,
that sucks.
<i>[pensive music]</i>
-I got an idea.
What we do is...
we incorporate shapes.
I'm circle, you're triangle,
and you're square.
-That's cool.
-We can even be
The Shapes.
-I think our costumes
should be that shape,
you know what I mean?
Like, cardboard cut-out
geometric shapes.
-Yeah, no.
-We should just be,
like, this is our head,
this is our hands.
<i>I'm not surprised Chi Chi</i>
<i>came up with this concept.</i>
This is, like,
a girl that shops at Michael's
for every outfit
that she owns.
-Just thought
we'd come on stage dressed like
a square, a circle,
and a triangle.
To me, that would be
more visually appealing.
-No.
-Naysha's already gone
home once.
<i>Derrick just got clocked</i>
<i>by the judges,</i>
and I sure in hell
don't want Michelle
calling me basic again.
We all need
to step our game up.
-I don't want
to help you guys,
but the genre in which you guys
are doing of synth
was all about
geometrical shapes, oddness.
Kaossonome was, like--he was
a walking triangle.
-But, I mean,
we can be fashionistas.
That's fine.
-If you could show me something
that's not a cardboard box
on my body then
I want to see it.
-I'm with Chi Chi.
-Acid Betty, seriously?
Shut the fuck up.
And you're the oldest one
in the bunch,
you should know better.
<i>[upbeat music]</i>
-We have to make it funny.
-Right, absolutely.
-Yeah.
-This week's Maxi Challenge
is to form new wave bands.
We have to write lyrics
and perform our track live.
-What if we just
wrote something, like,
just completely,
like off the cuff.
Like, I don't know,
chicken wings.
-Yeah, it could be our thing.
-That could be cute.
-The other team,
like, I don't--
Kim Chi and Robbie
as punk?
<i>-[Naysha Lopez] When I look at</i>
<i>Kim Chi, Robbie, and Naomi,</i>
I sure as hell
don't see no punk.
-And then chicken wing.
Maybe our song is, like,
something hot and spicy.
-Louisiana's finest.
-Barbeque.
-[Derrick Bary] You're a punk
group, and you're gonna scream
about chicken wings
and dipping sauces?
-Let's go chicken wings.
-[laughs]
-Nothing about this
is finger-licking good.
That group is gonna lose.
Like a Stepford Wife,
your fantasy.
-Or why don't you say,
"I'm not a Stepford Wife."
-Oh, that's good.
-I'm, like,
really excited about this.
-Well, Chi Chi
will help us soul this up too.
-Yeah.
<i>-I feel like Chi Chi doesn't</i>
<i>really want to be in our group.</i>
His energy is really off.
-I know
y'all want to work together,
but I have, like,
no look for neon couture,
so could I, like, go over
and cutout something real quick?
-Oh, Lord.
-Well, that sucks.
[sighs]
Chi Chi,
how did that sound?
Chi Chi, were you
listening, or no?
-It was good.
-Yeah, I think that's cool.
And if he doesn't like it,
he can change it.
<i>-Girl,</i>
<i>it's a group challenge.</i>
Engage...
<i>because that's what you do</i>
<i>when you're on a team.</i>
-Where did Chi Chi go?
-So I'm working
on my runway outfit
because these bitches
have fabulous costumes,
and I'm gonna walk
out in a neon bathing suit.
<i>So if it seems like</i>
<i>I'm a little worried, I am.</i>
<i>And that's why I'm quiet.</i>
I'm distancing myself
from the girls,
but you know what?
I'ma work this shit out.
<i>Peace.</i>
-All right,
let's keep writing.
How about the first line
is what's that smell?
-Hm, love it.
-'Cause we're singing about
street meat.
-You're right. You're right.
You're right. You're right.
You're right. You're right.
-It's quicker.
-You like to explain it.
-Yeah.
-When we go "yes,"
you don't have to convince us.
-And we just laugh
because you're--you--
-I just--
-'Cause we go like this,
"Yeah," and you go,
"It's so much simple, and,
"you know, I thought about it,
and you go like this.
"And there's a four-count,
and a four-count are so much
better than a three-count."
-Yeah. You're not
the most time-efficient.
-I'm very detail-oriented
and neurotic.
My process is,
like, I sit there and examine
every little tiny thing,
tear it all apart,
and put it back together.
-This is where the big
black beans could come in.
You see what I mean?
-No.
-Thorgy, is that not funny?
Come on, that is--
-Uh, no,
I don't think it's funny.
-What?
-[groans]
-What sets me off
is this sound...
[groans]
-[groans].
-Ugh.
-Ugh.
-[groans]
-[groans]
-Oh, my God.
You got to stop with, "Ugh."
-I really don't
mean it that way.
I have an ear for music,
rhythm, and, like, beats.
I'm a professionally trained
violinist, violist,
and cellist, so, like,
I have a very critical ear.
Don't argue with me.
I just wish you would trust me
when I say, like, a suggestion.
-We do.
-We do trust you.
Do you not see yourself
all over the song?
-All right,
now I know
that I can't even
speak without being attacked.
-No, that's not true.
Thorgy--
Thorgy is driving me crazy.
She's not contributing
as much as she's negating.
-I'm actually
holding back, like, 94%
of, like, what
I actually want to say.
-Thorgy, I really
love this drape-y fabric on you.
-Thank you so much.
-Oh, and then the other group's
trying to sneak in
and break down our defenses.
-Is it an actual cardigan.
-Just a simple scarf.
-Thorgy, you are
so easily distracted.
Oh, my God.
And they're looking for
the easiest chink in our armor,
and it's Thorgy.
-Thorgy, hi.
-Hey.
They keep changing my lyrics.
My lyrics are so good,
and they're like,
"Let's change it to this,"
which is, like, idiotic--
-Thorgy,
stop talking to them!
Jesus.
[laughs]
<i>I'm just over it.</i>
<i>Whose team are you on?</i>
Like, are you working
with the chicken wings
or whatever their fucking
names are?
-You guys are so fun.
Like, that's hilarious.
Team New York is in
a small, little boat,
and it's got a hole,
and it's sinking.
-I really think you're trying
to, like,
destroy the process almost.
-I'm really not.
-Now you're being
dramatic, Bob.
-Yes! Thank you!
He's being so dramatic!
-I didn't know I was
with two coo-coo birds.
-Those bitches
are going down.
-Hi.
-Hi, ladies.
-Ru hooked us up
with a Lucian rehearsal
for this challenge,
and my team is up first.
-Let's go ahead and see
what you've put together so far.
-There's a lot of pressure
on me for this challenge
because the judges weren't crazy
about my performance last week,
and I feel like this character
is gonna show them
that I do have soul.
-Here we go.
Cue music.
[record scratches]
-Whoa.
-[bad vocalizing]
Derrick.
[laughs]
Just stop.
-That--that's good,
but I feel like
it might be fun for you guys
to maybe talk-sing some of it
because you're not, like,
incredible vocalists.
Um, okay, let's try that.
Cue track.
-Stop.
Stop for a second.
You're still singing.
-Oh.
-And we were just talking about
talking instead.
-Okay. Talk.
-Yeah, more like a rap.
Derrick, you--you--
-I would rather sing.
I want to be
a pop star of drag,
and I feel like now that
I'm given the singing challenge,
this is my time
to put everything out there.
-Okay, so,
let's try it once more time.
-Yeah.
You're getting what I'm saying.
-Kind of catching on.
-That's awesome.
It's my advice that you
two listen to Chi Chi.
She really gets what I'm saying
in terms of the arrangement.
I really appreciate that you,
like, already
in one take
did kind of what I was saying,
so...it's really cool.
-Ugh.
<i>[punk music]</i>
all: Hey, bone collectors,
we're Les Chicken Wings,
and we've got a bone
to pick with you.
-All right,
the biggest thing
is to figure out
that punk attitude.
-Yeah.
-So when you perform this,
it's gonna have to be
times ten
of what you're doing right now.
-Right.
-So I want to hear
a little anger.
I'm gonna have
each of you give me,
like,
a loud, primal scream.
-Oh, boy.
-Naomi, you first.
-Okay.
[screams]
-You're smiling.
You're so happy.
Come on, anger.
Kim Chi?
-[screams]
-Robbie?
-[screams]
-Somebody just
snatched your wig,
tripped you,
and stole all your heels.
[all scream]
It still feels
like you're scared to,
like, let it out.
<i>-[Robbie Turner] So we're</i>
<i>trying to be punk and angst-y,</i>
but it was not working,
<i>and I'm feeling the pressure.</i>
I have been on
the bottom of the game,
so I need this win
more than anybody else
in this competition.
-Hello.
-How are you?
-How are you feeling song-wise,
lyrics and everything?
-I love it, anyway.
<i>[plucky music]</i>
-It's good. It's good.
-What's wrong?
-We love it.
-[laughs]
-So wait, you're not
all on the same page with it?
-We are on the same page.
-We are. We are.
We are. We are. We are.
-Thorgy just talks like that.
-We are, but she's, like...
-That's how she talks.
-Literally nit-picking.
-But we have a final product
that we're all happy with.
-We're good.
-Churl, I'm just over it.
I can't argue
with Thorgy anymore.
-I'm really--I'm happy.
-All right.
Here we go.
Cue track.
<i>all:</i>
-Ow!
-The only thing I would say
is that it was very character-y
and almost theatrical
instead of cool,
'80s, new wave vibe.
-All right. Cue music.
-Whoo!
-All right, all right.
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
So this is what
I'm talking about.
You're saying it exactly the way
you'd say it in a musical.
What's that smell?
That sort of doesn't have
the cool, B-52s' vibe.
Right now
it's just reading as,
like, cheesy,
and you're just like, "Ehh."
-I think the B-52s
are kind of cheesy.
-The B-52s are just
one example of a party band.
I'm just trying to direct
you to be more cool
because that's
what this era was about.
-That's how
they sound to me.
What do you mean by
"more cool"?
I don't get that feel
from our track.
Am I alone in this?
Really? No one?
<i>-[Acid Betty] Girl, you got to</i>
<i>listen.</i>
Open the ears,
close the mouth.
He's telling us to lay back,
stop be so,
"Hey, girl,
yeah, whoo, yeah!"
-I just don't know what
you're saying, Lucian, baby.
I just don't.
-You don't understand
what I'm saying?
-No.
-It's just about creating
your own style.
Like,
even someone like Lorde.
-I hate her.
I can't with her.
-Okay. Well--
I'm just telling you,
she has her style.
-When you think of Lorde,
I think of, like,
apathetic teenager.
Av--Ooh.
-I'm just trying to help you.
-I guess so I'll be Lorde.
-It's very surprising
that any queen
would come for me
because I'm gonna
be judging these bitches.
I'm not saying
to be Lorde.
I'm not saying
to be the B-52s,
but it can be
some other sort of melody
that is your thing.
-It's like,
"You're not the B-52s,
but how would B-52s say it?"
Is what it sounds
like to me.
<i>-[Thorgy Thor] Oh, my God.</i>
You are embarrassing us
in front of a judge.
If we're in the bottom,
Bob is going home, not me.
<i>-I know I shouldn't</i>
<i>be arguing with Lucian.</i>
I know I shouldn't be,
but I'm already in argument-mode
because Thorgy has got me
at the very edge of the cliff.
<i>Lucian's just</i>
<i>an innocent bystander.</i>
I think I may have just,
like, cost us this challenge.
<i>[upbeat mellow music]</i>
-Drag is not
a cheap profession.
-It's really not.
-I know. You got to do
what you got to do to live.
-Do you have enough
to, like, live off of?
-We were always
fortunate kids,
but we didn't have
a lot of money growing up.
So when I got
out of high school,
I started getting
all these loans
and just started
trying to find money.
-Yeah.
-And now I'm going
through a bankruptcy.
-Wow.
How much is your debt?
-It's, like,
in the tens of thousands.
<i>-Chi Chi] I work two jobs</i>
<i>washing cars</i>
<i>and checking</i>
<i>out people's groceries.</i>
Being broke is
a hurting feeling.
<i>People say they don't have</i>
<i>a dime to their name,</i>
but when you literally
don't have a dime,
you taking all your
shit to the Coinstar
to, like--
just to get $5.00,
like, I don't think
these girls understand that.
Not having the money
to buy fabric
and all that kind of stuff,
I just use what I got,
and that's where I find
myself saying, "Oh, I'm here
for the $100,000,"
you know what I mean?
-Yeah.
-When I want to be here
for the experience,
but in the back of my mind,
I just feel like
I need money,
and it's not all
about money all the time.
That's exactly why the stakes
in this competition
is so high to me.
It's not an option
for me to fail.
-I'm gonna put my hair up
and do my makeup,
like, immediately.
-Yeah, I am too.
-I'm always,
like, the last person
running around
with my head cut off.
-And yet you still win.
Every time.
-I've never won.
-Frida Kahlo
got a special mention.
-Yeah, a special mention...
-That was winning.
-That I was good
at the dance challenge
but didn't win,
but I was top,
and then we did
the acting challenge,
and I was, like--they were like,
"You were really good,
but--"
-Yup.
-I feel like
I'm the Susan Lucci.
-[gasps]
Come on. Susan?
-I'm the Susan Lucci
of the season.
<i>[Thorgy Thor  I nailed the</i>
<i>"Empire" acting Challenge,</i>
<i>and I was safe.</i>
<i>Bob wore literally</i>
<i>a $20 Halloween costume</i>
<i>that was falling apart,</i>
<i>and she won.</i>
<i>And, like, Bob is funny,</i>
<i>but so am I.</i>
I'm just not
as loud and annoying.
They were like,
"You were so wonderful.
You floored us.
We couldn't stop watching you.
Bob, you win."
-It seems
like Bob and Thorgy
are in a competition
of their own,
and somebody's feelings
are inevitably
going to get hurt.
<i>[laughs]</i>
<i>And, what?</i>
Welcome to the main stage
of "RuPaul's Drag Race."
Michelle Visage,
are you ready to get punked?
-I am indeed.
-And Lucian Piane,
did my girls rock your world?
-They did, Ru.
-And the co-founder
of Blondie, Chris Stein.
I hear you're a fan
of the show.
-I watch everything
religiously.
-[laughs]
And I must be dreaming.
It's the legendary
Debbie Harry.
-So happy to be here.
-I'm always touched
by your presence, dear.
-[laughs]
-This week,
we challenged our queens
to form new wave groups
and perform original songs
in front of a live audience.
Gentlemen,
start your engines,
and may the best woman win.

Welcome to She-BGB's.

-[Michelle] She could swim in
that.
-[RuPaul]
Naysha Lopez.
In case you didn't know,
I was a Lopez.
-Now you know.
-[Michelle] Uh-huh.
-[RuPaul] Chi Chi DeVayne
from the Bayou Country.
Whip it good.
-Uuh.
- -[RuPaul] Kim Chi.
-[Michelle] I love cabbage.
-[Michelle laughs]
-[Michelle] Yes. Me too.
-[RuPaul] Robbie Turner.
I don't know nothing
about birthing no babies.
-[RuPaul] Naomi Smalls.
Honey, she is serving

-[Chris Stein] Nosferatu goes to

-[RuPaul] Bring back my gills.

-[RuPaul] Thorgy Thor,
thoroughly modern Thorgy.
-[Michelle] Yeah.
-[Debbie] Absolutely.
-[RuPaul] Bob The Drag Queen,
not to be confused
with Bob the cable guy.
Bob, how's your head?
-No complaints.
[laughter]
-[RuPaul] Welcome, ladies.
I've made some decisions.
<i>[dramatic electronic music]</i>
Les Chicken Wings,
the crowd ate you up,
but one of you was
finger-licking great.
Robbie Turnt-her,
condragulations,
you are the winner
of this week's challenge.
-Yes.
-[RuPaul] You'll receive a wig
wardrobe from Weaven Steven.
-This is, like,
so huge to me
that you're in the room,
Ms. Debbie Harry.
Like, I have a poster
that was above my bed,
and my parents really thought
I was straight for a minute.
-You mean I was a beard?
[laughter]
A-The three
of you may leave the stage.
Now it's time for
the judge's critiques.
First up,
Bob The Drag Queen.
-Hi, Bob.
-Hi, Lucian.
Can I just say
before we get started,
yesterday,
I wasn't the kindest to you,
and that's not me,
and I apologize.
-What was going on?
-I wasn't really understanding
the references he was giving me.
Then I was like, "Well,
I don't even like that artist."
-Who was the artist?
-It was Lorde.
-Oh, well, you're in luck.
She's our guest judge next week.
-Whoo!
[laughter]
-Well,
I accept your apology,
and, today,
I was impressed,
<i>especially with</i>
<i>the black beans line.</i>
It really highlighted
your character.
Great job.
-[Michelle] I think ratchet
drag is your thing,
but I am in love
with the way you look tonight.
-Thank you.
-It's in the step
in the fashion direction.
Less ratchet, more fashion.
-But you have to stay
professional at all times,
no matter
how pissed off you are.
-Next up, hey there,
Thorgy girl.
-I'm not crazy
about this look tonight.
This is going on.
This is going on.
This is going on.
This is--
There's just so much
that I'm losing you.
-But you slayed it
in the performance.
You kept drawing my attention.
-Next up, Acid Betty.
-This thing is mind-blowing.
This is epic.
-I mean, did you actually
make that wig yourself?
-I made everything you see
but the shoes, yeah.
-Wow. Very good.
-Until you came out
in that challenge,
I got more Patty Duke
than I did Acid Betty.
I didn't get
why everybody else kind of
went crazy new wave,
and you went '50s.
It made me feel
that you weren't in your element
for the first time.
-Oh, okay.
I totally felt like I was,
so that's weird
that you felt that way.
-[RuPaul] Up next,
-Your makeup
made me so happy.
I did not see a trace
of she-who-shall-not-be-named.
-Yes.
-Tonight on the runway,
do you look pretty?
Yes, but I'm still waiting
for that breakthrough.
-I'm hearing
Britney Spears a lot,
but I--when I saw you
with the bangs
I thought you could do Debbie.
Maybe you should audition
for the movie.
-Oh.
-Wow.
-Call my agent.
-Well,
you have a terrific voice.
-Thank you.
-But you were kind of,
like, disappointing
as a performer.
I don't know what's
happening in your head
because you're not
giving us 100%.
-[RuPaul] All right,
next up, Naysha Lopez.
-Hi, Ru.
-Tell me about this outfit.
It feels like it's
painted on you.
-Yeah.
It's actually all airbrushed.
-And more to the point,
your ass is real?
-Yes. It's real.
-You got it from your Mama.
-And my daddy.
-Does your daddy deal
in medical-grade silicone?
[laughter]
-This is fun.
I think this is something
different for you.
[chuckles]
Now the outfit
in the group,
<i>it was like</i>
<i>part Dolly Parton,</i>
and then the circle
that wasn't really a circle.
-[RuPaul] In terms of the outfit
in your group,
were you in charge of that?
-It was a group challenge,
so we really participated
with everything
when it--you know--
-[RuPaul] Well, Chi Chi's
shaking her head.
You're saying it was not
a group effort?
-No, the thing
Thorgy had on her head,
that's what I wanted
to wear as the actual costume.
-I see.
-I'm not gonna
be in a cardboard box.
Absolutely not.
-Is this the first
you all are hearing
any dissention from Chi Chi?
-She was just disconnected.
-I see.
-You know, like, it was,
like, "Hey, Chi Chi,
"you want to come over here
really quick?
You know, we're gonna look
at some references,"
and it's like,
"All right. Whatever."
-Well, they was--
-I was told to
step my drag up,
and that's what
I wanted to do.
-So tell me why you're
out here in a bathing suit
with no corset and a belt.
-I don't have the expenses
to pay for something like this.
I'm in a bankruptcy.
I just don't have--
-Hold on.
You don't need money,
girl.
That's never an excuse.
I know you can turn a show.
What concerns me
is the attitude a little bit.
I'm getting the feeling
that you have fought very hard
to be where you are.
I get it,
but we're lifting you up.
Let us.
-I hear you.
I'm sorry, y'all,
that, you know,
I just kind of
halfed it, and--
-No, no, it's okay.
It's cool, sister.
-I don't want y'all
to feel like that, you know,
I tried to throw y'all
under the bus or anything, but--
-What is this bus
everybody keeps talking about?
[laughter]
Is the bus still running?
[laughter]
Thank you, ladies.
While you un-tuck backstage,
the judges and I
will deliberate.
<i>[car engine starts]</i>
All right, now
just between us Sunday girls,
what do you think?
Let's start with
Bob The Drag Queen.
-Bob was giving me
a little attitude,
but this is
a high-pressure competition.
-Absolutely.
-And I think personality things
that they may not even
like in themselves
sometimes come out.
<i>-[Debbie] And Bob did stand</i>
<i>out.</i>
Bob has a lot of charisma
and seems to know who he is.
<i>-[RuPaul] Thorgy Thor.</i>
-She delivered
on this challenge.
<i>There's just something</i>
<i>so quirky about her.</i>
-I agree.
I was totally drawn to her.
-Michelle, you had an issue
with her outfit.
-There was just so much
going on.
-Did she paint sideburns on?
-Down her cheekbones
and around her jawline,
<i>down her neck,</i>
<i>and down her arms.</i>
-I think her challenge
in this competition
is to edit it down.
<i>-[RuPaul] Acid Betty.</i>
-You know, I watch this show
all the time,
and I was kind of waiting
for this "Wow" moment,
and that was Betty's runway.
-But her outfit
in the performance
just was not cohesive for me,
and because of it,
she was completely swallowed up
by those other two girls.
<i>-[RuPaul] Derrick Barry.</i>
<i>-[Michelle] Most frustrating</i>
<i>thing, for me,</i>
is how temporary Derrick
is in performing.
And she's so not used
to performing something
other than Britney.
-But she, you know,
really had an outstanding voice.
-But it's hard
to judge her as her,
because Ru,
think about Chad Michaels.
-Mm-hmm.
-She can do tons
of other drag than Cher.
Derrick has to find a way
to break through that mold.
<i>-[RuPaul] Naysha Lopez.</i>
-I kind of lost her
in the performance
<i>to the other two.</i>
-Now she was eliminated,
and we brought Naysha back.
-She wants to be here so bad,
I can tell.
-Uh-huh.
-She's trying so hard,
but I don't know
if she is giving us enough.
<i>-[RuPaul] Chi Chi DeVayne.</i>
-In the performance,
she was the standout for me.
-She does have this mysterious
magnetic quality.
-On the runway, however,
there's no excuse
<i>for you to come out here</i>
<i>being that basic.</i>
No.
-I watch this show
all the time,
and you cannot wear
the same shoes
for the challenge
and the runway.
I'm sorry.
-Thank you.
[laughter]
-That's amazing.
-Silence.
I've made my decision.
Based on your
new wave performances
and your main stage
presentations,
I've made some decisions.
<i>[dramatic music]</i>
Bob The Drag Queen,
you're safe.
-Thank you.
-Thorgy Thor,
you're safe.
-[whispers]
Thank you.
Acid Betty, your runway look
was a bright spot,
but in the challenge,
you were overshadowed.
You're safe.
-Oh.
I'm Jewish, but I'm praying
to all the gods,
so thank you.
[laughs]
-Mishpocheh,
you may join the other girls.
Derrick Barry, you didn't quite
ace your Dragometry test.
Naysha Lopez,
in neon, you are radioactive,
but your performance
was not electrifying.
Chi Chi DeVayne,
your runway ouch-fit
didn't dominate.
Derrick Barry...
You're safe.
-Thank you.
-You may join the other girls.
-Wow
Deep breath, deep breath, deep
breath
-Naysha and Chi Chi,
I'm sorry, my dears,
but you are both
up for elimination.
-Seriously?
Again?
<i>What the fuck?</i>
There's just no way
that I'm gonna go home again.
-Two queens
stand before me.
Prior to tonight,
you were asked to prepare
a lip-synch performance
of "Call Me" by Blondie.
Ladies,
this is your last chance
to impress me
and save yourself
from elimination.
The time has come...
[thunder crashes]
for you to lip-sync
for...your...life.
<i>[echoes]</i>
<i>-[Chi Chi] The only thing</i>
<i>that keeps going in my mind</i>
is, "Girl, hustle.
Make it work."
I'm gonna lip-sync
for my fucking life.
-Good luck,
and don't fuck
it up.
<i>["Call Me"</i>
<i>by Blondie playing]</i>
-Ow!
<i>-Naysha is flipping</i>
<i>out tricks and flips</i>
<i>that I had</i>
<i>no idea she had.</i>
Chi Chi better beware.
[laughter]
<i>-Oh, my God.</i>
<i>Chi Chi just went in</i>
<i>for the kill...</i>
-Oh!
-And when I say kill,
I mean there was
blood everywhere.
-Whoo!
-Whoo!
-Yeah!
-[laughs]
-[cheers]
[cheers and applause]
-Ladies,
I've made my decision.
<i>[dramatic music]</i>
Chi Chi DeVayne,
shantay, you stay.
-Thank you so much.
-You may join
the other girls.
<i>[somber music]</i>
Naysha Lopez,
your beauty and your bootie
did double-duty
this season.
Now sashay away.
[applause]
-Bye, Naysha.
-Bye.
[laughter]
<i>[Naysha Lopez] I was giving it</i>
<i>110%,</i><span style="bodyStyle"> </i>
<i>and am I a little upset</i>
<i>that someone</i>
<i>that's giving 50%</i>
and not committed
at all is still here?
<i>Yeah, absolutely.</i>
I want to tell the girls,
"Stop your fucking
complaining.
<i>"Get your shit together,</i>
<i>and don't forget,</i>
<i>Ru has me on speed dial."</i>
So you just never know.
[chuckles]
<i>[somber music]</i>
-Condragulations,
ladies.
And remember,
if you can't love yourself,
how in the hell are you
gonna love somebody else?
-Can I get a amen in here?
-all: Amen.
-All right.
Now let the music play.

-Hi.
Now, this season
we‘ve been to Oz and back,
but the competition
ain‘t over.
Bob The Drag Queen,
Kim Chi, and Naomi Smalls...
[cheers and applause]
Tonight one of you
will be crowned
America‘s next drag superstar,
but I have not made
my final decision,
and because we‘re still
keeping it 100,
I‘ve asked each of you
to prepare
a lip sync performance
to a song created just for you.
Ladies,
this is your last chance
to impress me
and to show the world
that you deserve to be
America‘s next drag superstar,
so good luck,
and don‘t fuck it up.
[cheers and applause]
Now, our top three queens
have snatched your attention
all season long,
and tonight
I‘ve challenged each of them
to slay the stage one last time.
Purse first,
a New York City girl
who puts the taint
in entertaintment,
give it up
for a demure little lady
we call
Bob The Drag Queen.
<i>[upbeat music]</i>
<i>[deep voice]</i>
<i>Uh, over here.</i>
<i>All the other bitches</i>
<i>call me ratchet.</i>
<i>You‘re way too big</i>
<i>I snatch it.</i>
<i>Go ahead</i>
<i>and hand me the Oscar.</i>
<i>I‘m the only one</i>
<i>on the roster.</i>
<i>If you come for B-O-B,</i>
<i>you must be an SOB.</i>
<i>Never was a hater,</i>
<i>but I‘m making mashed potater</i>
<i>out of err‘body right</i>
<i>in front of you.</i>
<i>Ha, ha, ha.</i>
[cheers and applause]
[audience chanting] Bob! Bob!
Bob! Bob! Bob! Bob! Bob! Bob!
Bob! Bob! Bob! Bob!
[cheers and applause]
-Wow.
-[laughs]
Work it out for team humble.
[cheers and applause]
Now, while you catch
your breath,
let‘s talk to the judges.
Michelle Visage,
what‘d you think?
That was amazing.
Come on, choreography.
Phenomenal.
I‘m so proud of you.
And I love that you play safe.
Every one of your dancers
was wearing a hard hat.
I love that.
[laughter]
It‘s important.
I think you need to change
your name to Bob The Superstar.
Ooh.
Well, thank you, judges.
Now, Bob The Drag Queen,
from the moment
you entered the workroom
you had uniqueness, nerve,
and talent written all over you.
Let‘s take a look.
<i>-[Bob] My name is</i>
<i>Bob The Drag Queen.</i>
<i>I‘m hilarious, beautiful,</i>
<i>talented, and humble.</i>
<i>That‘s the biggest</i>
<i>pearl necklace I‘ve ever seen.</i>
-How you doing, RuPaul?
-[laughs]
I‘m sorry that I‘m late,
but "Uzo Abubu"
left the stage.
[laughing]
Well, then why did I waste
my time putting on this?
Oh, there‘s more.
This.
Sometimes you borderline
on showboating.
<i>-[Bob] Insert shady</i>
<i>rattlesnake noise here.</i>
[rolls tongue]
-Bob, how‘s your head?
-No complaints.
<i>-[Bob] I‘m Bob The Drag Queen,</i>
<i>a queen for the people.</i>
<i>[upbeat music]</i>
[cheers and applause]
Now, Bob, when did you first
become aware of drag?
I used to watch
"To Wong Foo."
Yas!
I saw, like, this, like,
glamazonian, like,
goddess coming down
from the ceiling
wearing a big confederate flag.
I was like,
"Oh, this bitch is--"
when I say bitch,
I mean it, like,
the way you‘d call
your grandmother a bitch.
[laughter]
I was like, "This bitch
is pushing buttons, girl,"
and I loved it.
You excelled at so many
of the challenges.
Did you study the show
before you came on?
No,
I‘m just really talented.
[laughter]
You know, listen,
this is my favorite show.
This is what I thought I was
supposed to be doing
my whole life.
When I was performing in,
like, bars in New York City,
dodging beer bottles
literally,
I was like,
"This doesn‘t feel right.
There‘s something bigger
coming."
Lo and behold,
I found something bigger.
Her name is RuPaul,
and she blessed me.
[cheers and applause]
Now, Bob, at one point
in the season
the other queens
were rooting for you to fail.
-Mm-hmm.
-What did that feel like?
It felt like
I was doing it right.
[laughs]
I mean, no one‘s rooting
for the person doing the worst.
No one‘s like, "Oh, you‘re doing
bad. You should get out."
They‘re like,
"Ooh, she‘s doing so well.
Get her the fuck
out of here."
All right,
so we‘ve got some
fan questions over there.
[cheers and applause]
Hallelu, I‘m back,
RuPaul!
[laughter]
Tucker from Florida
wants to know,
"Does your humor come
from overcoming
a dark place in your life?"
Um, see, I mean,
I have the struggles
that a lot of y‘all homosexuals
here had, especially--
What?
They‘re--wait, wait--
They‘re--this--
[laughter]
These are homosexuals?
A few.
I had the same hardships
that everyone else here has,
and we all deal with it
in different ways.
If you find something
to filter your pain
and your anger into,
it‘ll flourish.
It really will.
Thank you, Shangela.
Now, Bob,
you blew everyone away
with your Snatch Game
impersonations.
Now, did you ever hear
from Uzo or Carol Channing?
Well, Uzo
tweeted at me
and was like,
"This was amazing,"
and I was like, "Thank you,"
and I am obsessed
with Carol Channing,
but she‘s just--she‘s 95.
It‘s hard to get
out of the house when you‘re 95.
I‘m 18, and it‘s hard
for me to get out, so.
Yeah, I know, I know.
Well, we did hear from
the one and only Carol Channing.
Take a look.
<i>Thank you, Bob,</i>
<i>for your colorful</i>
<i>impersonation of me.</i>
<i>I‘m so honored</i>
<i>to be a part of your history.</i>
<i>Oh, I‘m proud of that.</i>
[cheers and applause]
Oh, my God.
Yes.
So Bob, I know your brother‘s
over there, right?
Yeah, he‘s the one who‘s just
a shade darker than me.
I‘m 11:00.
He‘s midnight.
[laughter]
Justin, what was it
like growing up with Bob?
Bob used to cry
on my birthdays
‘cause it wasn‘t about him.
That‘s true.
That‘s true.
Now, Bob,
I know that your mother
couldn‘t be here
because of her health.
-Yes.
-Darn, you know,
it would have been
a great opportunity for us
to have a taped message
or something,
but we didn‘t--we don‘t have--
wait a minute.
Oh, actually,
we do have a taped message.
- Oh.
- Let‘s roll that.
- Hey.
-<i> Bob, this is your mother.</i>
<i>I‘m very proud of you.</i>
<i>I‘ve always believed in you,</i>
<i>even when you didn‘t</i>
<i>believe in yourself.</i>
<i>Continue to work hard</i>
<i>on your craft.</i>
<i>Always respect your fans.</i>
<i>Reach for the stars,</i>
<i>Chris, do the best you can.</i>
<i>Like I always tell you</i>
<i>and your brother,</i>
keep the first thing
the first thing,
and I love you.
[cheers and applause]
You got me.
You got me.
Oh, my goodness.
Now, Bob, what would it mean
to you to win $100,000?
$100,000 isn‘t the thing
because money comes and goes,
but winning this title,
that means something.
You get to go forth
and carry a legacy
and do something and make
a change in somebody‘s life
and put first things first
and do something.
Right, well--right, well--
Now, I‘ve watched
all 109 episodes
of "RuPaul‘s Drag Race,"
and I‘ve noticed
you have never once
walked into
the room purse first.
Oh, my God,
look at this.
Oh,
and it matches my outfit.
It‘s perfect.
I love it.
Purse first.
I love it.
[cheers and applause]
Give it up for Bob
The Drag Queen.
Up next we‘ve got
an Instagram superstar
who‘s about to
lisp sync for her life.
Now serving Kim Chi.
[cheers and applause]
<i>[upbeat music]</i>
<i>Fat, fem, and Asian.</i>
<i>Fat, fem, and Asian.</i>
<i>Fat, fem, and Asian.</i>
<i>[speaking foreign language]</i>
<i>[singing in foreign language]</i>
<i>[speaks in foreign language]</i>
<i>[speaks in foreign language]</i>
<i>[speaks in foreign language]</i>
[cheers and applause]
Wow.
Kim Chi,
I love that song.
It‘s got a good beat,
and you can‘t dance to it.
[laughter]
All right, Kim Chi,
let‘s hear from the judges.
Michelle Visage,
what‘s the tea on Kim Chi?
I love that your purity
and your beautiful energy
took something that was normally
considered negative
and turned it into something
fun and beautiful.
Yes.
Nailed it.
[laughter]
Today Kim Chi
is on the menu,
and you are the main course.
Who‘s hungry?
Now, Kim Chi, you came
to this competition hungry.
You won the first challenge,
and then you stayed hungry.
Let‘s take a look.
<i>My name is Kim Chi.</i>
<i>-[Kim] I came to chop suey</i>
<i>the competition.</i>
<i>I‘m known for crazy,</i>
<i>over-the-top</i>
<i>pure anime fantasy.</i>
Animazing.
<i>I may across shy</i>
<i>because I am soft-spoken,</i>
but donut come for me
because I‘ll destroy you.
I do get concerned
about your walk.
It‘s very stiff, darling.
Exqueeze me?
My mom doesn‘t know
that I do drag.
What?
Kim Chi,
you didn‘t just get better.
You got fierce.
<i>I don‘t want to be</i>
<i>America‘s next drag superstar.</i>
<i>I am America‘s</i>
<i>next drag superstar.</i>
Now, Kim Chi,
you were so honest
and vulnerable this season.
In fact,
watching the show back,
at one point
you made me ugly cry, girl,
so I hope you don‘t mind
if I ask you
some very personal questions.
First one, when was
the last time you fell down?
[laughter]
Actually, earlier today.
I‘m not even joking.
I tripped on my skirt,
and I fell over
the craft service table.
[laughter]
Now, everyone
is gagging on your looks,
just so many amazing looks.
What inspires you?
My inspiration comes
from a lot of random places.
I could be walking
down the street
and see a rock and be like,
"Oh, that rock is pretty.
Let me make a gown
inspired by the rock,"
so there‘s no one
set inspiration,
but everyday life and nature.
Now, is it true
you gave the $3,000
you won in
the first challenge
to your mother?
Why‘d you do that?
My mom works really hard to,
you know, pay the bills,
and she works as a server
at a Korean restaurant
currently,
and I want to do everything
that I can to help
my mom financially.
Yeah.
Have you told her
that you do drag yet?
I still have not,
but, you know, it‘s like--
She didn‘t watch the show?
I mean,
she‘s very Korean-American,
and she‘s really, like, not open
to American culture at all,
so I don‘t think--
yeah, I don‘t think
she‘ll ever find out
about "Drag Race."
Well, listen,
I am a firm believer in
things happen when
they‘re supposed to happen,
so right after this,
why don‘t we drive
over to your mother‘s house
and I tell her myself?
-Road trip?
-Road trip.
- Road trip.
- Yes.
Who‘s here
supporting you tonight?
I have my friend
Ryan, Diana, Amy, and Trixie.
So Diana, what do you think
of Kim Chi‘s journey?
I think Kim Chi
is the most creative, talented,
and hardworking person I know.
I‘m so happy
to be your friend,
and I want the best for you.
All right, now,
we‘ve got some fan questions
for you, Kim Chi.
Oh, look,
we have the Pit Crew coming d--
and they--
you forgot your pants, guys.
Kim Chi,
Tiara from Facebook asks,
"If you could
lose your virginity
to a member of the Pit Crew,
who would it be?"
Um, I‘m not trying
to catch anything,
so I‘m gonna say none of them,
but--
[audience groans, laughs]
Shade. Shade.
Shade!
[laughs]
Oh, thank you,
Pit Crew members.
I don‘t know what
to say after that.
All right, Kim Chi,
well, we have one more question.
Well, actually,
it‘s more of a statement.
Take a look.
Kim Chi,
I am supreme leader,
but you are supreme
drag queen.
You better work,
or else I put you
in a labor camp.
Kim Chi, it‘s Margaret Cho.
I‘m so proud of you.
You‘re so beautiful.
You are so funny, and I think
you are a good dancer.
[cheers and applause]
So Kim Chi,
what would it mean to you
to become America‘s
next drag superstar?
It would obviously
change my life.
I‘d be able to not be broke.
I‘d be able to afford
guacamole on my burrito bowl.
I‘d be able to start
my own makeup company,
which I would love to do,
and it would mean that
anybody who‘s ever felt
like they weren‘t
part of anything,
anybody that felt like
they couldn‘t be anything,
as long as you stay true
to who you are,
be creative, be original,
and your dreams
will eventually come true.
Well, Kim Chi,
read my lisp,
we love you.
Ladies and gentlemen,
give it up for Kim Chi.
[cheers and applause]
Now it‘s time for our
final performance
of the night.
Oh, and by the way,
kittens,
you can buy these
top three songs right now
wherever fine music is sold,
and you can watch them
again and again
at logotv.com.
Now, our next queen
strutted her stuff
all the way to the top.
Please give a big supermodel
welcome to Naomi Smalls.
[cheers and applause]
Wow.
Legs for days.
Okay, Naomi, let‘s talk
to the judges. Michelle Visage?
Honey, whatever‘s on the menu,
I‘m buying two.
Look how far
you‘ve come, honey,
and you have proven tonight
that you have legs up
on the competition.
Yes, you do.
You came, you saw,
you contoured,
and you conquered.
Yes.
Thank you, Naomi Smalls.
Now, as the youngest queen
to compete this season,
you‘ve come a long way,
baby.
Let‘s take a look.
I am Naomi Smalls.
Check your lipstick
before you come for me.
<i>-[Naomi] Naomi has legs all</i>
<i>the way up to her asshole.</i>
<i>Naomi is a fashion girl.</i>
She‘s fucking fierce.
Bitches better beware.
Oh, all of that right there.
<i>I‘m giving you Naomi Campbell</i>
<i>strutting down</i>
<i>a Versace runway.</i>
I just thought
it was perfection.
This is how you win
this competition.
I have eight brothers
and three sisters.
-Whoa.
-That is crazy.
This is my mom.
She‘s, like, the best mom ever.
Do you have a message
you want to say to your mother?
Thank you for everything
you‘ve ever done,
and I hope I can repay you
for the rest of my life.
I‘m Naomi Smalls,
and I promise
to represent you fiercely.
[cheers and applause]
Naomi, you have the fever
and the flavor for fashion.
Now, where does that come from?
I honestly don‘t know
because I grew up in, like,
a family
that was--sorry, guys,
not the most fashion-forward
or anything like that,
but I just remember,
like, looking at magazines
when I was a kid and just
being so obsessed with them,
and I wanted to look
like these amazing supermodels
-that were in the glossy pages.
-Sure, yeah.
Now, halfway through
the competition
you seemed to come to life.
What happened?
I was so scared
in the beginning
of standing out and--like,
for the wrong reasons,
but when it comes
to Snatch Game,
you can‘t hide anywhere,
and being in the bottom two
and having to lip
sync for my life
just put that fire
underneath my ass
to take chances and stand out
for all the right reasons.
-Yeah, you did really well.
-Thank you.
Now, Naomi,
we have a taped message
from one fierce queen.
Let‘s take a look.
Hi, Naomi.
Now, in Westeros
there‘s only room
for one queen,
but in Ru‘s queendom, girl,
I can‘t wait to see
you take that crown.
Now...Cersei that walk.
[cheers and applause]
-I love that.
-So good.
Now, we have some
fan questions.
G-G-G-Gia?
-Herminio from Mexico...
-Hi, Herminio.
Would like to know
how did it feel
when Naomi Campbell
checked you online?
[laughs] It was, like,
the biggest moment of my life.
What did she say?
Well, she followed me
on Instagram,
and then she had,
like, this interview saying,
"I really am loving that
Naomi Smalls," and I, like--
I love that.
Tell me this.
What would it mean to you
to become America‘s
next drag superstar?
It would mean
the world to me
to be America‘s
next drag superstar.
Just to get that
stamp of approval
from you and carry on
your legacy would be--
<i>-[Crowd] Yeah, supermodel,</i>
<i>work!</i>
The biggest goal
I ever met in my life.
I love it.
Now, before we go,
I want to say hello
to your mother.
Where is she?
She‘s right there.
- Would you--where--
Oh, there she is.
Hi.
So June,
what was it like
raising a leggy supermodel?
Well, I‘m a little shocked
that he didn‘t get
fashion tips from me.
I had no idea.
He has always been amazing.
-Really?
-Yes.
Did you buy the fashion
magazines, or did--
No, but I did start buying
the wigs and the shoes
and the--
[cheers and applause]
Now, besides Naomi,
how many kids did you raise?
-12 altogether.
-Wow.
Wow.
Naomi, where are
your other brothers
and sisters tonight?
Well, they‘re
all over the world.
They‘re actually
all over this theater too.
Well, let‘s bring them out,
the Von Trapp family singers.
[laughter]
Come on out.
Where are they?
Oh! Oh! How are you?
- Hi, sweetie.
- How are you?
-How are you?
-Ahh!
You know,
like I always say,
the family that drags together
slays together.
Let‘s hear it
for the legendary,
all legs, no dairy,
Naomi Smalls.
Now, we‘re just moments
away from crowning
America‘s next drag superstar,
but first it‘s time
to bring back my girls.
[cheers and applause]
Starting with a nerdy bird,
a glam rock rebel,
and one cuckoo queen.
My name is
Dax ExclamationPoint.
What‘s up, nerds?
<i>-[Dax] My look is very</i>
<i>inspired by, like, science</i>
<i>fiction</i>
<i>and comics,</i>
<i>strong, bad bitches</i>
<i>who don‘t take any crap</i>
<i>from anybody else.</i>
Show me your
exclamation point.
Yeah!
All right, ladies,
let‘s turn up the juice
and see what shakes loose.
<i>Laila is,</i>
<i>like, a whory quasi--</i>
I don‘t want to say gothy,
but, like, gothy.
<i>-[Tyler] My biggest concern is</i>
<i>that I‘m gonna</i>
<i>fade into the background.</i>
I‘m here too.
Dax ExclamationPoint,
Laila McQueen,
neither one of you
survived that lip sync.
Sashay away.
<i>-[Dax] Both of us?</i>
Really?
How you doing,
mis amores?
My name is Cynthia Lee Fontaine.
Do you want to see my cuckoo?
Cuckoo.
Cuckoo.
I need a space
for this junk in the trunk.
<i>-[Cynthia] I‘m sexy as a</i>
<i>goddess is.</i>
<i>I‘m funny as a clown.</i>
<i>[record scratches]</i>
Did my teeth look yellow?
No.
[cheers and applause]
Dax ExclamationPoint
and Laila McQueen, welcome back.
-Hello.
-Hey, Ru.
So Dax, I hear that the song
"I Will Survive"
is haunting you
everywhere you go.
-Is that true?
-Yes,
like, literally everywhere I go,
like, it could be a gas station,
grocery store, anywhere,
it just happens to come on.
Listen, if I were you two,
I would seize the moment.
I would record another song.
I would s--call it
"I Didn‘t Survive."
You know?
It‘d be a huge hit.
But seriously, there are
no losers on "Drag Race."
Dax, what‘s life been like
since you were on the show?
Honestly, life
has been absolutely amazing.
Like, the fans
have been phenomenal.
I mean, obviously, like,
I don‘t have as many fans as,
like, you know, Kim Chi
or Bob or Naomi.
That‘s fine.
It‘s fine,
but the ones
I do have are phenomenal.
Now, I‘ve got a confession
to make.
Laila McQueen
and I have a secret past.
I deny it, but there‘s proof.
Take a look.
[groans]
That little pixie to the right
of me is Laila McQueen
when I was not
running for president
in Manchester, New Hampshire.
You know, my grandmother
calls you Ron Paul.
[laughter]
Now, did you ever
imagine at that point
that you would be on this stage?
Oh, absolutely not.
I mean, I was performing in,
like, function halls
and Mexican restaurants.
Like, I never imagined being
here or anywhere else
around the world.
So now, what‘s happened
to you because of "Drag Race"?
I get to go everywhere
and meet the people
that love the work I do
and embrace so much love
that I never thought
I would see.
All that at the truck stop?
[laughter]
So Dax, Laila,
you aren‘t just surviving.
-You are thriving.
-Thank you.
Next up,
straight from Santee Alley,
Cynthia Lee Fontaine.
Now, since the show,
you‘ve been through it,
haven‘t you, girl?
Yes, actually the episode
that I been eliminated,
I was experience symptoms.
I‘m here to celebrate that.
-Wow.
-Yes.
And how do you feel right now?
I‘m in the discharge process
already right now,
so I feel amazing.
-I feel fantastic.
-Good. Yeah.
Did any of your drag sisters
reach out to you?
Yes, one special person,
and it‘s Acid Betty.
- That Acid Betty?
- That Acid Betty.
Yeah, Acid Betty.
She came to visit me as soon
as she knew
that I was diagnosed.
She was taking care of me.
She was like, "Bitch,
you‘re not alone.
I got your back."
I think the positive attitude
from all my entire
new sisterhood
helped me to recovery
and helped me
to be more positive every day.
Wow.
I love it.
Well, Cynthia Lee Fontaine,
we are cuckoo for your cuckoo.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Now a queen
who always picks up when I call
and a badass
in total control of herself.
Let‘s take a look.
The beauty is here.
My name is Naysha Lopez.
I spend money.
I don‘t do drag on a dime.
Naysha Lopez, sashay away.
How soon can you get here?
Bitches, I‘m back!
Face, body, glamour.
Your ass is real?
Yes. Realness, boo.
This acid trip is all real.
My drag style is completely over
the top, punk unicorn realness.
The main bullet point
of Acid Betty is she‘s a bitch.
I‘m not gonna be unprepared
because of you, boo.
Acid Betty,
you‘ve taken us
on one wild trip.
Now, Naysha Lopez, Michelle
and I have a running bet, okay?
That ass of yours, is it real?
So listen, Ru, I--
[laughter]
I eat well.
I work out.
I have 10 ccs
of medical grade silicon.
I--no.
[laughter]
So on the show
you said your ass was real.
My ass is real.
However, have I had
some enhancements
to the body-ody-ody?
-Yeah.
-Yes, I have.
Ah.
[laughing]
Now, you missed
the Madonna runway storyline.
- Yes.
- What would you have worn?
I‘m a very creative person,
and what I had going on
was another kimono.
What?
What is it with these queens
and kimonos?
Naysha, thanks for gracing us
with your gorgeous beauty
and that booty twice.
Yes.
Next, Acid Betty.
Now, are you really here,
or am I having a flashback?
Now, you turned out some killer
looks this season.
-[crowd whooping]
-Thank you.
How have fans been to you?
I love the fans.
They are the best, the best.
The best thing
of this show are the fans.
The love is so intense,
and it‘s wonderful.
I actually had a kid
that I met at DragCon,
and they decided that
they were gonna go into fashion
and got a full
scholarship to FIDM
because of seeing me
on the TV show.
-Wow. Wow.
-That‘s really great.
Now, Acid Betty,
you took a lot of heat
for your Nancy Grace
impersonation,
but some people really,
really liked it.
Take a look.
Acid Betty,
I loved watching you be me,
but frankly,
speaking professionally,
you got a raw deal.
You were robbed.
No tea, no shade,
but unleash the lawyers.
We got a case here.
-That‘s fierce.
-I love it.
Aci, I could go
on talking to you all night,
but I refuse
to say anything further
until I lawyer up.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Acid Betty.
Now, the best way to describe
our next three queens
is brassy, Brooklyn,
and Britney, bitch.
Good morning.
My name is Robbie Turner,
and I‘m the kindest queen
you‘ll ever meet.
-Yes, Marilyn.
-She‘s in a league of her own.
I would wear the hell
out of that jumpsuit.
-Oh!
-Oh!
Too real?
Whoo! Thorgy
with a T-H and orgy,
and I feel incredible.
I‘m colorful.
I‘m fun,
and I‘m a fashion clown.
This is harder on me
than it is for you guys.
No, it‘s not.
<i>-[Thorgy] I can be campy,</i>
<i>but also I can be,</i>
<i>like, fucking fierce.</i>
I‘m so proud of you.
Great job.
Yes!
It‘d Derrick, bitch.
<i>-[Derrick] I may look angelic,</i>
<i>but I am not that innocent.</i>
I also have a career
with my wigs on.
You‘ll have a career once
you start gluing yours down.
You have to give us more.
That is not a Britney reference.
-Oh!
-Oh!
That‘s how you go out
in style, girls.
Now, Robbie Turner,
how does someone so young know
so much about classic Hollywood?
My mother and father
wouldn‘t allow us to watch
contemporary films,
so we watched
classic Hollywood films
all the time, so I thought
they were contemporary.
So you can imagine
little baby Robbie
when she‘s like, "Judy Garland
died many moons ago,"
and it‘s like, "What?"
Now, what was your favorite
moment on the show?
On my birthday
I won the singing challenge
with the le chicken wings,
and Debbie Harry came back
and said happy birthday to me.
I‘m like, um,
I don‘t see the problem
with this birthday at all--
"Drag Race,"
Debbie, chicken wings.
[laughter]
Robbie, thank you so much
for all the classic sass.
Oh, and by the way,
I will be sending you a bill
for that broken light bulb
that you did.
Uh-huh.
Up next, hey, there,
Thorgy girl.
Hey, Ru.
Yeah!
[cheers and applause]
Now, like Michelle and I,
you and Bob
have a very complicated
relationship.
Tell me about it.
I love to argue
and fight about everything.
I love it.
There‘s always a way
to tear things apart
and make them better.
Bob can take it from me.
He‘ll just listen
to me talk and go,
"I still don‘t like you."
[laughter]
But when people see me
and Bob doing that,
they‘re like, "Oh, you guys
really don‘t like each other."
I‘m like, "I just love
fighting with him so much,"
but I‘m just in love
with Bob very much.
Now, you have dreams
of starting a thorchestra?
-Is that right?
-Yeah.
What is a--what‘s
a thorchestra?
Well,
ever since I was playing violin
and then I got into,
like, the art of drag,
I wanted to conduct, like,
a 40-piece orchestra.
I wanted to travel the world.
I want, like, Rufus Wainwright
to wheel out on a piano
and be like, "Oh,
my friend Rufus
is here to sing a song."
That‘s a great idea.
Will you play a little something
for us right now?
Sure.
Oh, my God!
[laughter]
[gentle melody]
[high notes]
[cheers and applause]
Thank you, guys.
Well, Thorgy,
I cannot wait to see
what you‘re gonna do next.
Whoo!
Up next, the 100th queen
to prance into
my workroom--
Whoo!
Now, you struggled to get
out of the Britney box,
-as it was called.
-Yes.
What‘s your relationship
with Britney now?
I will always do Britney.
I‘m not leaving that behind.
Of course I wanted
to come on the show
to expand what I already do
and take it to the next level,
and I feel like not only can I
do Britney now, I can do drag.
I‘m doing drag right now.
Now, Derrick,
throughout the season
you were not afraid
to speak your mind loudly,
especially with Bob and Naomi.
You have any regrets about that?
Everything?
Oh, gosh, it‘s hard
because I watch it back,
I‘m like, "Oh, wow,
I shouldn‘t have said that.
Probably shouldn‘t have had
that drink and untucked,"
[laughter]
and yes,
I have a hard time
taking criticism
because I‘ve never been
criticized like that before.
Doing Britney was
what I‘ve always done,
and I was praised for that,
and now coming
into this competition
it was almost looked down
upon that that was something
that I was known to do.
And I learned so much
from Naomi,
and she taught me
how to block my brows,
and I think I‘m doing it now.
Thank you, Derrick,
and I will always think of you
as my genie in a bottle.
Yes, I know
that‘s a Christina song,
but I‘ve run
out of Britney references!
-Give me a break.
-Yes.
We love you, Derrick Barry.
[laughing]
Now, we are moments
away from finding out
if Bob The Drag Queen, Kim Chi,
or Naomi Smalls will be crowned
America‘s next drag superstar,
but first the queen
who has turned this season
on its head.
Let‘s take a look.
<i>Laissez les bon temps roulez.</i>
<i>My name is Chi Chi DeVayne,</i>
<i>and I don‘t get ready.</i>
I stay ready.
[snapping]
<i>-[Chi Chi] My drag is that</i>
<i>real southern dragged out style</i>
<i>of drag.</i>
<i>Prove to us</i>
<i>that you‘re a champion.</i>
<i>Not only have you guys</i>
<i>taught me how to be</i>
<i>a better entertainer,</i>
but you have taught me
how to be a better person,
and $100,000 cannot buy that.
[snaps]
Yes, Louisiana glamour.
When you came to "Drag Race,"
you had quit two jobs
to be on the show.
How many jobs do you have now?
I have one job, Ru,
and I‘m a full-time drag queen!
That‘s what‘s up.
That‘s what‘s up.
How do fans
react when they meet you?
Oh, my God, first time in
New York, I‘m in Times Square,
and the shortest little
Hispanic woman
stopped me in the street,
and she just instantly
start crying.
-Wow.
-She explained it to me
that I represented
all of the people
in the world to her
that are out there
struggling to make ends meet
and who have a dream,
and the dream has come true.
Dreams come true, y‘all.
Dreams come true.
And speaking of dreams,
the "Dreamgirls" lip sync
that you did,
oh, honey,
that was legendary,
and I‘m not the only one
who thought so.
Take a look at this.
<i>You, Miss Chi Chi DeVayne,</i>
<i>are a true inspiration.</i>
<i>I tell you</i>
<i>that your heartfelt rendition</i>
<i>of "And I‘m Telling You"</i>
<i>moved me,</i>
<i>and honey, when those bees</i>
<i>start flying right</i>
<i>after you and I hit</i>
<i>our high note, honey,</i>
<i>you gave me life,</i>
<i>and I‘m gonna make you</i>
<i>an official Dreamgirl.</i>
[cheers and applause]
Do you have anything else
you‘d like to say?
Thank you from the bottom
of my heart.
You have changed
my life forever.
Thank you.
You made my dreams come true.
That is the sweetest thing.
I really appreciate that.
I‘ve been watching you
for a long time,
and to have you finally
on the show is really my honor.
All right, now it‘s time
to announce the winner
of this year‘s
Miss Congeniality.
All the way from Moscow
by way of Boston
and a pit stop in Pacoima,
it‘s Katya.
<i>[upbeat music]</i>
[laughter]
<i>[music resumes]</i>
-Hi, Katya.
-Hi, Ru.
Hey, listen,
I brought you some water.
Are you thirsty?
So Katya,
what have you been up to?
Oh, my God,
what haven‘t I been up to?
Listen, I learned
horseback riding.
I‘ve been doing macrame.
I visited, like, 6
out of the 12 continents
in the world.
It‘s been a whirlwind.
It‘s been a--
All right, yeah, well,
is there something
you want to tell me?
I mean--
- I--well, okay, yeah,
I‘m not technically bisexual.
I mean, I‘m open.
I‘m open--
No, no, no, no, n--no.
No, no,
I am open--listen, I am--
I‘m talking about
what you came out here for.
You remember?
You came--
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah.
-Oh, look at this thing. Okay.
-Yeah.
Oh, yeah, hold--will you hold
this water for me please?
Yeah, sure.
The winner of season eight
Miss Congeniality
and a cash prize of $5,000...
-[audience whoops]
-Yup.
Courtesy of the all-new
Fiat 500x crossover
is...
Cynthia Lee Fontaine!
Cynthia, is there anything
you‘d like to say?
This is very important for me
because experiencing cancer
give me the opportunity
just only to be
stronger than ever
and represent my community
the best that I can,
and the only way
that we can do that is funny
and showing the cuckoo
to the world.
[laughter]
Thank you, RuPaul, so very much.
-Thank you.
-Thank you to my sisters.
And thanks
to all of you for voting.
Thank you.
All rise for your top three--
Bob The Drag Queen...
<i>["The Realness" plays]</i>
Kim Chi...
Naomi Smalls.
There are only eight people
on earth
that know what it feels like
to be the winner of
"RuPaul‘s Drag Race,"
and they‘re all here tonight
to share their words of wisdom.
Welcome back my champions.
BeBe Zahara Benet.

<i>In that case, just be Alaska.</i>
Chad Michaels.
<i>Snap out of it, ladies.</i>
<i>Just do you,</i>
<i>or when in doubt,</i>
<i>just do Cher, bitch.</i>
Jinkx Monsoon.
<i>When the bitches</i>

<i>and don‘t forget,</i>
<i>the best thing</i>
<i>about monsoon season</i>
<i>is it happens annually.</i>
<i>[laughs]</i>
Bianca Del Rio.
<i>I‘ve got some advice</i>
<i>for this year‘s winner.</i>
<i>Enjoy the ride,</i>
<i>and pay your damn taxes.</i>
<i>Right, Sharon?</i>
<i>Jinkx?</i>
<i>Raja?</i>
And America‘s reigning
drag superstar,
Violet Chachki.
Wow.
Violet,
what has your year been like?
My year has been incredible.
I‘ve worked with some of
the best people in the industry,
the fashion world,
the burlesque world,
the art world.
I‘ve gotten validation,
people that I respected for
years and years and years,
so it‘s been the most personally
gratifying year of my life.
I am so thankful to RuPaul,
all the fans.
Thank you from the bottom
of my heart.
I love you guys.
Thank you, Violet.
Now, in addition to the title
of America‘s
next drag superstar,
the winner of
"RuPaul‘s Drag Race"
will receive a crown and scepter
provided by Fierce Drag Jewels,
a sickening supply of makeup
from Anastasia Beverly Hills,
and a cash prize of $100,000.
[cheers and applause]
Now, the time has come
to crown our queen.
Bob The Drag Queen,
Kim Chi, Naomi Smalls.
As always, I‘ve consulted
with the judges and the fans,
but the final decision
is mine to make.
The winner of
"RuPaul‘s Drag Race,"
America‘s next drag superstar
is...
<i>[suspenseful music]</i>
Bob The Drag Queen.
My queen, is there anything
you have to say?
-Yes.
-I have too much to say,
but I‘m gonna keep it
to one thing.
Take whatever you love
about yourself,
and walk
into the world purse first!
Listen,
if you can‘t love yourself,
how in the hell you gonna love
somebody else?
Can I get a amen up in here?
-[all] Amen!
All right,
now let the music play!


<i>Previously on</i>
<i>"RuPaul's Drag Race"...</i>
You're going to form
your own New Wave bands.
I think our costumes
should be cardboard cutout
geometric shapes.
Yeah, no.
-[laughs]
-[spits]
In terms of the outfits
in your group,
were you in charge of that?
It was a group challenge.
Well, Chi Chi's
shaking her head.
The thing
Thorgy had on her head.
That's what I wanted to wear.
I'm not gonna
be in a cardboard box.
Robbie Turnter.
Condragulations.
You are the winner
of this week's challenge.
Yes!
Chi Chi DeVayne.
Shantay, you stay.
Naysha Lopez.
Sashay, away.
Ugh.
-Ooh, Chi Chi.
-Oh, Lord.
How do you feel, Chi Chi?
Tonight there was a lot
of drama on the runway.
I ain't gonna be
in no bottom again.
I apologize, Derrick.
If I'm feelin' some kind of way,
I completely shut down.
-Mm-hmm.
-And I have to change that.
I mean, it's just me being
a bitch. I'm sorry.
Yeah,
it was you being a bitch.
Well, this is my second week
in the bottom three.
I am so happy to still be here.
I was in shock
that it was not you lip-syncing.
It was Naysha.
[Derrick] But Chris and Debbie
thought I stood out.
Chris was like, "I think
you could impersonate Debbie.
And we'll take you out on tour."
They may have been on drugs.
I want a drug test.
Yeah,
I didn't hear you get that.
-But--
-I did get told
that my performance
was phenomenal.
Which you didn't get told.
All right.
Derrick, I think
you just missed the point,
-but it's not a big deal.
-Okay.
Well, I don't know
if there was a point.
It's just Bob talking
is your point all the time.
But you'll do, like,
side shady comments,
and it's funny,
but when I do side shady
-comments, it's like, over.
-No. No, but what you--
Anyone else see this?
Am I on Lonely Island?
Am I on Staten Island or am I
living in Manhattan right now?
-You're right.
-Thank you.
-[laughs]
-I don't see that I do that.
I can't wait
till you do it again.
It'll be, like, five minutes.
Lord have mercy.
The two of you, honey.
That is a pot boiling.
Derrick's, like,
"I ain't never
make jokes about anyone ever."
Hey, Bob.
If I want to do
ratchet drag next week,
can you give me any tips?
Ooh hoo hoo!
If you want to do, like,
memorable drag next week,
-I can give you some tips.
-[laughs]
So all I need to do
is not wear a wig
and I'll be told by
the judges that I'm pretty.
-Babe.
-Didn't I remind you guys?
I said, "In about five minutes,
she'd make a shady comment
out of nowhere"?
And I did.
What I said wasn't meant
to hurt your feelings.
You're trying to be spiteful.
You see the difference?
Your intentions
weren't to hurt me?
No, they weren't to hurt.
If I wanted to hurt you,
you'd be cryin'
right now, bitch.
I will never cry
over you at all.
Don't give me a challenge.
I work on the strip with
really big drag personalities.
So if you think
you're gonna come for me,
I am not that innocent.
<i>[car engine starts]</i>
<i>The winner</i>
<i>of "RuPaul's Drag Race"</i>
<i>receives a one-year supply</i>
<i>of Anastasia</i>
<i>Beverly Hills cosmetics</i>
<i>and a cash prize</i>
<i>of $100,000.</i>
<i>With extra special</i>
<i>guest supermodels</i>
<i>Chanel Iman</i>
<i>and Gigi Hadid!</i>
<i>[pastoral music]</i>
<i>[rooster crows]</i>
Where they chicken wings?
[screams]
You know what I love
about this process?
I'm becoming, like,
a morning person.
I'm up at, like, 6:00,
and I'm like, "It's 6:00!"
Bob, you're, like,
an all day person.
-Yeah.
-You're like,
"It's mornin', evenin',
and night!
Yeah!
Yeah!"
Whoo!
I'm boisterous.
<i>I'm excited to be here.</i>
I'm on my favorite
fucking TV show.
<i>And that bothers some people.</i>
Sorry, girl.
-[siren blaring]
<i>-Whoo, girl.</i>
<i>She done already</i>
<i>done had herses.</i>
<i>-Carol Channing, Brittany G.</i>
-Whoo!
<i>On a game show</i>
<i>with a bunch of queens.</i>
<i>Judge Judy, Maggie too...</i>
Yes!
<i>Little Richard, we love you.</i>
<i>Drag queens with an aptitude</i>
<i>for thinking fast</i>
<i>and being crude.</i>
<i>Don't just stand there.</i>
<i>Let's get to it!</i>
<i>Make me laugh.</i>
<i>There's nothing to it.</i>
<i>Bang, bang, bang, bang.</i>
[laughter]
Hello, hello, hello.
[cheers and applause]
Wow.
Ladies.
For this week's maxi challenge,
we're going to break
out of the studio
as we drive
along the Hollywood freeway
looking for fresh roadkill.
Then, back in the workroom,
you'll need to transform
the furry little pelts
into evening gowns
that scream
"#CritterCouture."
Oh, hell,
who am I kiddin'?
It's time to play
the Snatch Game.
[cheers and applause]
[laughing]
#SnatchGame.
Now, you know how it works.
Impersonate a celebrity,
fill in the blanks,
and stake your claim
as a front-runner
in this competition.
Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best woman win.
[applause]
Who you doin', baby?
I was gonna do Nancy Grace.
Which is brilliant by the way.
-Yeah, I think it's funny.
-Because she's so, so funny.
-Over the top. Right.
-Oh, she's the craziest.
And just have outrage
at every--everything.
Every corner.
I'm impersonating
Nancy Grace, herself,
because she seems
like a major bitch,
and I can relate to that.
Robbie,
what are you thinkin' about?
-I'm doing Diana Vreeland.
-Who?
She was the first
editor in chief
-of "Vogue" in the '60s.
-Oh.
Do you think
that's a hair obscure?
No.
Not at all.
I have been practicing
Diana Vreeland for months.
Jinkx Monsoon and BenDeLaCreme,
my Seattle sister wives,
won Snatch Game each year
that they were on.
So there's a lot
of pressure on me to be great.
What character
are you doing?
Well, I was going
to do Whoopi Goldberg.
"The Color Purple" is, like,
one of my favorite movies.
And it's so quotable.
Everyone knows
"The Color Purple."
-Yeah.
-I've been working on it
since I found out I was gonna
be on the show.
And I cannot wait to be able
to prove that I am a performer.
I'm not just a runway queen.
Who are you doing?
I'm torn
between Whoopi Goldberg,
Uzo Aduba,
who is an actress on, um,
-"Orange Is The New Black"...
-Oh, yeah.
And my last choice
is probably my favorite,
but I look the least like her,
is Carol Channing.
Why would you do--well.
<i>I know some folks</i>
<i>are gonna question</i>
why is a 6'2" black man
doing Carol Channing, but it's
because I feel a connection
with Carol Channing.
-I really do.
-See, isn't this not--
-Miss Celie?
-[laughs]
You really do look like
Miss Celie.
I sure is ugly.
I want to show you how much
I look like Whoopi Goldberg.
So Bob basically has,
like, ten characters
that he could possibly do.
All the sudden, he's got
the "Sister Act" outfit on.
He is, like, really giving
that Whoopi look.
I think that if you hit a man,
a man has the right
to knock you out.
You don't want
to get hit by a man,
don't go around hittin' people.
That's all I'm sayin'.
This is gonna
be the Whoopi Game
instead of the Snatch Game.
I'm realizing,
"Oh, shit.
I might be out
of my league here."
So I'm gonna have to go
with my plan B backup.
Bob is so excited
for Snatch Game,
that he's changed
his character, like, 90 times.
I think these
are the moves
you got to do
to be Uzo Aduba.
But the brightest bulbs
have a way of dimming suddenly
or just going out.
Today's challenge--
Ding! Ding! Ding!
Is gonna be Snatch Game.
<i>It's a celebrity impersonation,</i>
<i>so you have</i>
<i>to make people laugh.</i>
So I'm gonna be busier
than a one-legged cat
in a sandbox tryin'
to win this challenge.
Hey, celebrities.
[all] Hey!
Are you ready
to snatch my attention?
[all cheer]
-Hi, Chi Chi.
-Mama Ru.
[laughs]
Who are you doing?
-I'm doin' Eartha Kitt.
-Uh-huh.
How are you gonna make
Eartha funny?
Um, I know
that she played Catwoman
and I have two cats at home.
I'm just gonna play off--
Well, that--there it is!
You've got two cats at home.
To play Snatch Game,
you've got to stay in character,
and you've got to make me laugh.
-Yeah.
-All right. See you out there.
-All right.
-Thank you.
Hi, Kim Chi.
Have you decided on what
character you're gonna portray?
Um, there's two characters
I'm debating between.
First one is...Pearl.
Is there something on my face?
[laughs]
I started doing drag
with Pearl,
<i>who was on season 7,</i>
<i>so I know her quirks</i>
<i>really well.</i>
Right. Right.
And who's your other character?
The other one
is kind of obscure.
-Uh-huh.
-Kimmy Jong-un, maybe.
-Kimmy?
-Kimmy, yeah.
Kimmy Jong-un is a huge risk,
but if I turn
the North Korean dictator
into a drag version of him,
it would be a chance
<i>for me to show</i>
<i>another side of Kim Chi</i>
that's a little fucked up.
Huh.
That's interesting.
Listen, whatever works for you.
Just so long as
you make me laugh.
Kimmy Jong-what?
<i>A made-up character,</i>
<i>my friend.</i>
I really hope that
lands her in the bottom.
Are you gonna do Brittney?
It's an obvious choice.
But this is my chance
to show everyone
that I'm more than
-just a Brittney impersonator.
-Uh-huh.
And so
I think I'm gonna go
with Laura Bell Bundy's
character.
Yes,
she's the country singer
-Broadway star.
-Right.
And she made up
all these characters,
and Shocantelle
-is my favorite one.
-Uh-huh.
She is a black girl
trapped in a white girl's body.
Ah.
Can I see a little bit
of your Laura Bell Bundy
character?
Hello, RuPaul.
I am here.
My Shocantelle you
that I do have a penis.
You know, sometimes
the most obvious thing
is the thing to do.
You just have to decide
where you want to go.
Stakes are high.
There's $100,000 on the line.
Yeah, that's true.
-All right, Derrick.
-Thank you, Ru.
-Bye.
-Bye.
Oh, Lord.
-Thorgy Thor.
-That's me.
Wait a minute, let me see.
I'm getting, uh,
-Charles Manson.
-No.
-No?
-Uh, I'm doing Michael Jackson.
How are you gonna make
Michael Jackson funny?
His little quirks.
His little movements
that I have down.
Yeah.
Who's your biggest
competition here?
You know, I'm gonna say Bob.
You know, what you're asking us
to do in this season,
Bob is really excelling at,
which is pissing me off.
Well, let me tell you this,
Thorgy.
And this might help you.
You second-guess
and you take it into your head.
-Constantly.
-This is an opportunity
for you to feel confident
going with your gut
and not overthinking things.
-Yeah.
-All right, Thorgy.
-I'll see you out there.
-Okay.
All right, ladies.
Gather round.
Tomorrow on the runway,
the category is
"Night of 100 Madonnas."
[all cheer]
Madonna has so many
iconic looks.
<i>I can't wait to see</i>
<i>what everybody comes up with.</i>
It's gonna be amazing.
So express yourself,
'cause it's a celebration.
-[all cheer]
-So don't fuck it up.
-Holiday.
-Bye.
Bye, Ru.
<i>[drum roll, triumphant music]</i>
Welcome to Snatch Game!
Let's meet
our supermodel contestants.
"Vogue" cover girl Chanel Iman.
Hey.
[laughs]
And "Sports Illustrated"
bombshell Gigi Hadid.
-Hi, Ru.
-Hi, darling.
I'm so excited.
Are you ready
to meet our stars?
-We are.
-Yes.
First up, the king of pop,

I love everyone.
[scatting]
-The king of pop is here.
-[giggles]
Next, we have the sister
of the supreme leader
of North Korea, Kimmy Jong-un.

You know what I mean?
[laughs]
Next up, television host
and former prosecutor,

the mutha-fuckin' house.
[laughs]
Up next,

How are you?
You're not wearing

Who wears panties?
What are those?
All right, up next,

I don't wear panties either.
You don't
wear panties either?
Especially when I get
out of cars.
[laughter]
All right.
From "Orange Is The New Black",
Uzo Aduba is here.
Don't say anything stupid.
Don't say anything stupid.
Uh, how you doin', RuPaul?
Are you ready
to play the game?
I'm excited.
I don't know
why you all gaggin'.
She bring it to you
every season.
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, Snatch Game.
Welcome back to Snatch Game.
Here's how the game works.
I ask a question,
and you give an answer
that you think will match
our supermodel contestants.
[giggles]
First question.
Gigi Hadid.
There's a new dating app
for drag queens.
When you join,
the first question they ask
is, "How big is your blank?"
Let's go to Gigi Hadid.
How big is your wig?
I love that!
Let's go to our superstars
and find out
if you got any matches.
Okay.
Let's start with Kimmy Jong-un
from North Korea.
The first question
they ask is, "How big is your"?
I wrote down
weapons of ass destruction.
Weapons of ass destruction.
Not a match.
[laughing] I--yeah.
Well, thank you,
the unbreakable Kimmy Jong-un.
Ms. Eartha Kitt.
Well, I'm sorry, Gigi...
[laughter]
But I said,
"Big furry balls."
How big is your big
furry balls?
Honey, get your mind
out of the gutter.
Of course.
-[laughing]
-[purring]
Prosecutor Nancy Grace.
Well, as everybody knows,
not only do I do newscasting,
but I also was on another show
where I danced.
So I said, "How big
are your bunions?"
What do you do for bunions?
Well, I was told
you can get 'em shaved off.
That's what they do.
I'm about to get that done.
All right.
Sorry, Gigi.
Not a match.
Let's move on to
Tiffany "New York" Pollard.
How big is your clock?
Because drag queens
love a big-ass clock, right?
[feeble laughter]
Ru seems to be throwing Naomi
every bone she can find.
Do you like a big clock,
yourself?
But this dog won't catch.
Chanel Iman.
It's your turn now, darling.
The big bad wolf
is a drag queen.
Instead of huffing,
and puffing,
and blowing,
she blanks the house down.
Shakes?
She gonna shake
the house down.
Shake that ass.
Mm.
All right, well,
let's go to our celebrities
and find out
if you've got a match.
Let's start
with Latoya's brother,
Michael Jackson.
I just said,
"Takes a long nap
in a bed
with everyone they know."
-Michael, that's crazy.
-Thank you.
[laughter]
Mm-hmm.
Let's move on
down to Diana Vreeland.
I used to work
for "Vogue" magazine.
But I heard that now
"Vogue" means a dance.
So I think they vogue
the house down.
Girl.
This performance is poo.
And you're from the same town
as Jinkx and Dela?
Ooh, girl.
Them girls is gonna--
I was about to say
they gonna hang you,
but I ain't gonna say that.
[laughs]
Eartha Kitt.
Instead of huffing, puffing
and blowing,
she blanks the house down.
She licks the house.
Ooh.
Licks the house down.
And speaking of lick,
it's time for my bath.
What?
Oh, you--
[laughs]
[giggles]
[laughter]
Ha, ha.
That's what cats do.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Eartha Kitt
didn't do that, Chi Chi.
Let's move on down
to Britney Jean.
She reads the house down.
That's not a match,
unfortunately, Chanel Iman.
But has Eartha Kitt
got your tongue?
I've had that tongue before.
-You have?
-Good girls gone bad.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.
You should do
that one more time.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I would be very
popular in prison.
[laughter]
All right.
Crazy Eyes.
[laughs]
Because you pretty,
I just wrote a poem...
-Yeah.
-To Iman.
A-Once a queen named Iman
remind me of the Sun.
Instead of her
supermodel life,
She can be...
my wife.
[laughter]
Unfortunately, Chanel,
that is not a match.
Next question.
Let's go to Gigi Hadid.
Lady Bunny has an unusual way
of celebrating gay pride.
Instead of the rainbow flag,
she hangs her blank
out the window.
Her tucking panties.
Let's go to the king
of pop and hear
if you have a match.
Oh, Ru.
It's not a match,
but I said, "She waves
her blanket."
-Say "Hi."
-Oh, hi, Blanket.
-Hi, Blanket.
-Hi, hi. Bye-bye.
Oh, please be careful.
You don't want Blanket to fall.
-No.
-Oh, thank you.
Yes.
[scatting]
Moving on down
to Tiffany "New York" Pollard.
When I think of Pride,
I think of...my hair.
So I said $800 weave?
That's an $800 weave?
Well, of course.
Blended.
Yes.
Yes.
<i>Naomi's "New York"?</i>
I'm sorry, Gigi.
You didn't get
a match this time.
Maybe next time.
Well, look who's here.
I'm sorry
that I'm late.
But, uh, Uzo Abu-boo
left the stage
and she asked me
if I would fill in.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Carol Channing.
Oh, thank you.
[laughter]
All right.
Chanel Iman.
Sally the Supermodel
is so lactose intolerant,
when the photographer
says, "cheese," she blanks.
-Sneezes.
-She sneezes!
Let's go down to Nancy Grace.
She sends out an Amber Alert.
Nancy Grace is terrible.
It's important
to keep the children
safe from the boozers
and the users
and the reefer smokers.
<i>It's lifeless.</i>
It's basically Acid Betty
turned into Boring Betty.
Let's move on down
to Britney Spears,
the princess of pop.
She, "Oops.
I did it again."
-Ahh.
-[giggles]
Do you mean
between me down there?
She had diarrhea.
[laughter]
All right,
let's move on to Diana Vreeland.
I've worked with Sally
for so long.
She pops a pill, RuPaul.
She pops a pill.
There is so much talk
about drugs.
I have-haven't taken
anything but Lipitor
for the past ten years.
You don't really
get a buzz off of that.
Now, is there an anal option?
I might happen to have a Fleet
or two in my home.
A Fleet enema.
Now you're talkin'
my language.
If you stay ready,
you ain't got to get ready.
By the way, Eartha,
I didn't know
that was you down there.
-It's me, darling.
-From here,
I couldn't tell if you were
Della Reese or Luther Vandross.
I couldn't see.
These aren't even
my good glasses.
But back to
the matter at hand.
I just wrote "corn".
-That's always a good answer.
-You know, there's no dairy.
And it comes out the way
you put it in, RuPaul.
Well, listen.
On that note, I am sorry, folks,
but we are well out of time.
It was a really
close game,
but the winner is...
[drum roll]
Charo!
<i>[record scratches]</i>
[screaming]
[lively music]
She won!
-I win!
-You won!
She won!
[screaming]
[laughs]
Mwah!
What?
I can't believe she--
[laughter]
Always the first.
<i>It's elimination day,</i>
and it is the
Night of the 100 Madonnas.
And as I'm pulling out
my kimono,
I see Thorgy's also
pulling out a red kimono.
Great minds think alike?
In New York, it's funny.
It's like we're always put
in these boxes of, like,
what people's expectations
of who we are as, you know,
-drag artists?
-Yes.
Now, even people
are putting Brooklyn in a box.
Brooklyn doesn't accept me.
<i>I think there's a lot</i>
<i>of queens at home</i>
<i>who do not interact with me.</i>
It sucks that none of them
ask me to be a part
of their community.
So I don't fit in anywhere.
There are certain definitions
of "drag."
You know, and there's,
like, "I'm put in it 'cause
I'm the 'look queen.'"
I've had fights
with those people
where they're like, "Oh,
you're not a drag queen.
-You just do looks."
-Yes. Mm-hmm.
<i>It hurts me, actually,</i>
<i>that I'm a lone soldier.</i>
And I think
that's that huge wall
that I put in between me
and myself and everybody else.
I think this show's
a great platform, though,
because it kind of shows
that we do something more
than just stand around
-and serve booze.
-Yup.
You know, or sit around
and be a bitch.
Yeah.
You know,
I do all these shows.
I make all these things.
But I'm also a musician.
What I really want to do is,
like, do a grand,
like, event,
like, "Thorgy
-and the Thorchestra."
-Fabulous.
Like, a 40-piece orchestra,
and I want to conduct in drag.
<i>I am a professional violinist,</i>
<i>violist, cellist.</i>
<i>You know, I've played</i>
<i>at Carnegie Hall many times.</i>
<i>I feel like I'm</i>
<i>the perfect medium</i>
<i>to kind of appeal to, like,</i>
<i>the younger generation</i>
and make Classical music cool.
It's a throwback to, like,
events where, like,
you dressed up just to get
on the red carpet.
I love that.
Do you have any siblings, Bob?
I have two brothers, actually.
-Uh-huh.
-How many do you have?
I have eight brothers
and three sisters.
-Whoa.
-That is crazy.
-You said you were adopted?
-Yeah.
Did they have a talk where
they were, like, "You know--"
Where they went, like, one day,
like, "Well, just so you know."
Well,
it's--like it's very obvious
that I'm adopted.
These are my parents.
So growing up
with white parents.
A rainbow family.
Like, this is my mom.
She's gorgeous.
Yeah, she's, like,
the best mom ever.
I'm literally the only gay one
in my family.
<i>And I have</i>
<i>a Christian background,</i>
<i>and I've heard stories of kids</i>
<i>being shunned from the family</i>
<i>and all that.</i>
<i>And my mom has done nothing</i>
<i>but make me feel accepted.</i>
And, she's just
an amazing woman.
I love my mom.
Growing up, I literally had,
like, the best parents
and best childhood.
Did you ever feel a--a need
to just study up on black stuff?
Kind of.
It wasn't a weird thing
until I got to high school,
middle school.
People were throwing out
all these, like,
black references.
And I was, like, "Wait.
What does that mean?"
Did you grow up with,
like, black culture
was, like, second-hand?
I grew up
in an all-black family.
I went to all-black high school,
all-black elementary school
and a majority
black middle school.
Like, I get called "Oreo,"
like, all the time.
-It's obnoxious.
-Or, like, "Oh,
he's kind of cute
for a black guy."
Oh, don't even get me started
on being cute for a black guy.
It's kind
of a--it's really obnoxious.
Wait, I think you're kind
of cute for a black guy, Naomi.
Thank you, Kimberly Chi.
Kind of, though.
[laughter]
<i>["Cover Girl"</i>
<i>by RuPaul playing]</i>
<i>[laughs]</i>
<i>And, what?</i>
Welcome to the main stage
of "RuPaul's Drag Race."
The world's biggest Madonna fan,
Michelle Visage.
You must be my lucky star.
[laughter]
A guy who's game for anything,
Carson Kressley.
Now, who would you do
in the Snatch Game?
I would impersonate, um,
like, maybe a man.
Like, Michelle Visage.
[laughter]
The gorgeous Gigi Hadid.
Now, is it more fun to hang out
with models or drag queens?
Well, I've never had
this much fun at a runway show,
so, drag queens, of course.
[laughter]
And the stunning Chanel Iman.
Did you have a good time
yesterday?
Yes.
-It was everything.
-[laughs]
This week, our queens
channeled showbiz greats,
as they went
for Snatch Game gold.
And tonight, my girls
are ready to take a bow,
because bitch!
They're Madonna.
Gentlemen, start your engines.
And may the best woman win.
[RuPaul] Thorgy Thor.
Crouching Tiger,
Hidden Drag Queen.
[RuPaul] Nothing
really matters.
[Michelle] No,
sure doesn't.
<i>As I'm walking down</i>
<i>the runway, I'm giving you,</i>
<i>like, angular,</i>
<i>interesting artistic movements,</i>
<i>and I'm feeling it.</i>
[Michelle] Undercover geisha.
[RuPaul] Oh, kimono,
she better don't.
Up next, Kim Chi.
Oh.
Two in a row.
<i>I have a gorgeous</i>
<i>vintage wedding kimono.</i>
<i>But I wish I wasn't wearing</i>
<i>the same thing as Thorgy.</i>
[RuPaul] She's servin'
that walk, Michelle.
[Michelle] She is.
[Carson] W-O-K.
[RuPaul] Yeah.
Derrick Barry.
Nothing really matters.
The remix.
[Chanel] Yes.
<i>I'm walking down</i>
<i>in the most original kimono.</i>
<i>It's hand-painted,</i>
<i>and I feel like</i>
<i>this is a standout piece.</i>
[Michelle] Is that sidewalk
talk?
[RuPaul] Jean Paul Gaultier.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Naomi Smalls.
[Michelle] Oh, again.
[RuPaul] Yeah, these girls
are really hung up on kimonos.
<i>I didn't think</i>
<i>anybody else</i>
<i>was going to choose</i>
<i>kimono Madonna.</i>
<i>I'm trying to own this</i>
<i>even though three other girls</i>
<i>are in the exact same look.</i>
-[Carson] Kung fu fightin'.
-[Michelle] This is, like,
the Victoria's
Secret section of Madonna.
[Carson] I like that material,
girl.
[laughter]
[RuPaul] Acid Betty.
She's keepin' her baby.
It may have a few holes
in it, but--
[laughter]
<i>My Madonna look today</i>
<i>is from "Bedtime Stories,"</i>
<i>where she's pregnant,</i>
<i>giving birth to doves.</i>
<i>This outfit</i>
<i>represents who I am,</i>
<i>because obviously</i>
<i>I'm the only one</i>
<i>creative enough to think of it.</i>
[RuPaul] I think she just
flipped us the bird.
[Michelle] Bye, bye, birdie.
[RuPaul] Robbie Turnter.
[Michelle] She's in a league
of her own.
[RuPaul] There's no crying
in baseball, Robbie!
<i>I feel so cute.</i>
<i>I've got my cute little dress.</i>
<i>It's all hand-painted</i>
<i>with my little patches.</i>
[RuPaul] I wonder if she's
a pitcher or a catcher.
[Michelle] Me too.
[RuPaul] Chi Chi DeVayne.
You're gonna poke somebody's
eyes out with those things.
[Michelle] If you're lucky.
<i>When you think of Madonna,</i>
<i>you think of the cone bra.</i>
<i>-Bitch, I look good.</i>
<i>-[RuPaul] Oh, yeah.</i>
It's--she's totally
expressing herself.
I think she likes
a little hanky-panky.
-Bob The Drag Queen.
-[Michelle] Oh!
[RuPaul] Not to be confused
with Bob the camp counselor.
[Chanel] I love.
<i>My favorite Madonna look</i>
<i>is Madonna at the GLAAD Awards</i>
<i>when she dressed</i>
<i>like a boy scout.</i>
<i>And it is a huge</i>
<i>political statement.</i>
<i>And I'm not in a kimono!</i>
[RuPaul] Get a load
of those Girl Scout cookies.
[Michelle] Yes!
[RuPaul] And she earned a badge
for walking children in nature.
[laughter]
Welcome, ladies.
When I call your name,
please step forward
and strike a pose.
[whispers indistinctly]
Kim Chi.
Chi Chi DeVayne.
You're both safe.
Thank you.
You may leave the stage.
Oh, the power of good-bye.
[laughs]
Ladies, it's time
for the judges' critiques.
Tonight
on the runway,
I don't know
if you guys had some kind of
symbiotic message
to each other,
but there's a lot of kimonos
which is very interesting.
Thorgy, you did your take on it.
You kept it in geisha,
but still Thorgy's in there.
The Michael Jackson
was so good.
I loved all of it.
You kept character
better than anyone.
It was everything for me.
[laughs]
Up next, Acid Betty.
I was not expecting
to see "Bedtime Stories"
and the whole
bird-fly-out thing.
-So kudos to that.
-Thank you.
I think your make-up
is okay tonight.
It's nothing spectacular.
But where I was really let down,
was in the Snatch Game, Betty.
It didn't look like her.
It was like the wig
and the make-up,
you were like
a white Chaka Khan.
I didn't get
any Nancy Grace from it.
It felt like
you were just being you.
It was just a fail
all the way around.
I wasn't sure how to turn
such a serious woman funny.
I needed like a nasal,
angry southern voice.
And then she leans in,
and she wants to talk
to you on the TV
like she's in your living room.
[laughter]
I wish I had you as a coach.
Okay.
All right.
Up next, Robbie Turnter.
I really enjoyed your catwalk
because it was really fun
and playful.
I was really excited
about Diana.
And I--I think that most people
may not know who that is.
So I think that
how iconic she was,
and the voice and everything,
you kind of have to shove
that in people's faces
for them to get it.
You could have gone
so much bigger with her.
Punk took my voice away.
My voice kept cracking,
and I was going in and out
during Diana Vreeland.
Well,
we could hear you perfectly.
It's just, we weren't impressed
with what was being said.
Up next, Naomi Smalls.
It's becoming quite
predictable
for Naomi to come out
in basically, lingerie.
This is where we go, "Oh, maybe
I should switch it up now."
In Snatch Game,
I got lost with the boobs.
I think if you would have just
stuffed it to the max,
it would of made the character
a lot more obvious to me.
That was your moment
to go O-T-P.
I was very underwhelmed
with my performance.
It was not coming out,
and I'm, like,
so embarrassed about it.
All right.
Thank you, Naomi.
Up next, Derrick Barry.
So we did Britney, huh?
I am so grateful.
Oh, God.
You done good, girl.
Me and Gigi really,
really loved your
Britney performance yesterday.
You kept character
the whole time.
-You just were Britney.
-Thank you so much.
[RuPaul] Thank you, Derrick.
Bob The Drag Queen.
Tonight, on the runway.
Love it.
I love your Madonna look too.
And I know you're
a<i> huge</i><span style="bodyStyle"> Madonna fan.</i>
And, like, one of
your biggest thing you said,
was when Madonna sent you,
like, a cease and desist?
-Yes!
-[laughs]
-Best moment of my life.
-[laughs]
The padding.
It's so good,
I wouldn't have known.
You are serving "womana."
This old luscious body.
The Snatch Game.
Uzo Aduba, amazing.
You were so good.
Then, we get a little
Carol Channing.
You gave us extra,
which was wonderful.
I do want to caution you,
however.
Sometimes you borderline
on showboating.
Just keep that in
the back of your mind.
Mm-hmm.
All right, ladies.
Well, I think
we've heard enough.
While you untuck backstage,
the judges and I
will deliberate.
All right.
Now, just between us
material squirrels.
-[Michelle] [laughs]
-What do you think?
Thorgy Thor.
Her Michael Jackson,
I thought was divine.
She was really good
at making fun of things
that are a little taboo.
She stayed in character
the entire time.
I really felt
like Michael was there.
-[RuPaul] Acid Betty.
-Her runway was very creative.
But her Nancy Grace
was more like Nancy Disgrace.
Ooh, child.
How does a drag queen
do Nancy Grace
and she doesn't even
have the wig right?
You need a little
helmet-y blonde.
And then you need a few
little Nancy Grace-isms.
And none of that happened.
It was just like,
she didn't even know
who Nancy Grace was.
[RuPaul] Robbie Turnter.
The "League of Their Own" look
stood out from the rest.
-I would give it a B plus.
-We love Diana Vreeland.
We do, indeed.
Everything was wrong about it.
Why didn't she go
for the blown-back hair?
With the--
with the bump at the top.
Yes!
The worst part
of the whole thing tonight
with Robbie, was the--
[coughs feebly]
[whispers]
"I have no voice."
-Uh-huh.
-All of a sudden,
you don't have a voice anymore?
And I think she needs
to get out of her head
and get into my car.
Okay.
All right, Billy Ocean.
Naomi Smalls did
Tiffany Pollard. New York.
[Michelle] She didn't
do New York.
-She did not do New York.
-She wasn't New York.
She wasn't Connecticut.
She wasn't New Jersey.
She wasn't Long Island.
I don't know what she was.
But, Naomi's was my favorite
of the kimonos.
She made me want to wear it,
but I don't know
if it really screamed "Madonna."
[RuPaul] Derrick Barry.
The Britney blew me away.
I was so excited for every time
that she was going
to answer a question.
The runway thing,
I always find her a bit
timid on the runway.
When you're on the catwalk,
you've got to just
give it all you got.
You know, I once asked Iman
what is on her mind
on the runway.
And she looked at me dead
in the eyes and said, "Africa."
[laughs]
[Carson] That's what I do
when I go to bars.
-Oh, really?
-Yes. Think about Africa.
Oh-kerr!
Oh--
[trills, clicks tongue]
-[RuPaul] Bob The Drag Queen.
-She flipped the script.
Come back as an African-American
Carol Channing
doing a<i> fabulous</i>
<i>impersonation of her.</i>
-Right.
-And the Madonna thing,
it was the most
well put together
thought-out costume.
I didn't even know
leg pads were a thing.
There's a lot goin'
on on the stage
that would blow your mind, Gigi.
-Uh-huh.
-Show-and-tell backstage after?
Oh, I don't know
if you ready.
[laughter]
[claps]
Silence!
I've made my decision.
Bring back my girls...
[whispers]
Now.
Thorgy Thor.
Your Michael Jackson
was off the wall.
And your Madonna look
was something to remember.
Bob The Drag Queen.
I's was crazy
about your Snatch Game.
And on the runway,
you are one unapologetic bitch.
Bob The Drag Queen,
condragulations,
you are the winner
of this week's challenge.
Thank you.
Thank you.
[applause]
You've won a collection
of handbags and wallets
from Lux De Ville
valued at $7,000.
Wow.
[all "oohing"]
[laughs]
Wow.
Whoo!
I took a risk, and it paid off.
Bob and Thorgy,
you may join the other girls.
Derrick Barry.
You are safe.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Acid Betty,
your runway was
an immaculate conception.
But your Nancy Grace
left us asking,
"Who's that girl?"
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
I totally agree
with Snatch Game.
It sucked.
But I think Snatch Game sucks.
Robbie Turner,
your runway was a hit.
But your Snatch Game
was a swing and a miss.
Naomi Smalls,
your runway look was borderline.
But your impersonation
of "New York"
bordered on "New Jersey."
Naomi Smalls.
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
Robbie Turner,
you are safe.
Thank you.
Two queens stand before me.
As always, I've consulted
with the judges.
But quite frankly,
I don't give a
fuck what they say.
Because the final decision
is mine to make.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me
and save yourself
from elimination.
The time has come
for you to lip-synch
for your life!
<i>[echoes]</i>
<i>Life!</i>
I'm not about to go home
to Acid Betty.
<i>I'm gonna bring it,</i>
<i>and I'm gonna do everything</i>
<i>I can to send this bitch home.</i>
Good luck,
and don't fuck it up.
["Causing a Commotion" playing]
<i>[Acid Betty]I'm pregnant with</i>
<i>birds coming out of my belly,</i>
<i>and now I have to lip-synch</i>
<i>for my life?</i>
<i>I'm ready to make TV history.</i>
<i>[Naomi Smalls] All you hear</i>
<i>is music.</i>
<i>You have no idea what's</i>
<i>happening around you.</i>
<i>And in that moment, you will do</i>
<i>whatever it takes to stay.</i>
[all] Yeah!
[cheers and applause]
Ladies.
I've made my decision.
Naomi Smalls,
shantay, you stay.
<i>Oh.</i>
Acid Betty.
You've taken us
on one wild trip.
Thanks for the high.
Thank you for the opportunity.
It's been amazing.
And I'm so happy to be
a part of royalty now.
Now, sashay away.
I love you guys.
Acid Betty out!
<i>[Acid Betty] I'm so happy</i>
<i>that I came here.</i>
<i>I would not change this</i>
<i>for anything.</i>
<i>Legends are born</i>
<i>in "RuPaul's Drag Race".</i>
<i>And now I'm officially</i>
<i>a legend.</i>
Bitches beware.
'Cause Acid Betty is now
being released to the world.
And it's gonna be trouble
from here on out.
My seven rays of light.
You live to die another day.
And remember,
if you can't love yourself,
how in the hell are you
gonna love somebody else?
Can I get an "Amen" in here?
[all] Amen.
All right.
Now, let the music play.
<i>["Die Tomorrow"</i>
<i>by RuPaul playing]</i>


<i>Previously on</i>
<i>"RuPaul's Drag Race"...</i>
If I want to do
ratchet drag next week,
can you give me any tips?
If you want to do, like,
memorable drag next week,
I can give you some tips.
[all gasping]
Your intentions
weren't to hurt?
No, they weren't to hurt.
If I wanted to hurt you,
you'd be crying
right now, bitch.
You need to create
original drag couture
inspired by "The Wonderful
Wizard of Oz."
-It's working?
-Yeah, it's done.
<i>(Derrick Barry) What?</i>
<i>Do something more</i>
<i>to your outfit,</i>
because it doesn't
look that great.
I'm ready
for that Chipotle.

Bustles can be flattering
when they're on a big gown.
This looks like just a bunch
of ruched up fabric stuck.
(RuPaul)
Derrick and Tara Barry.
I did sew everything on here.
It's a piece of fabric.
Everyone should take a look
at Naomi right now.
This is how you win
this competition.
[laughs]
(RuPaul) Who deserves
to click their heels
-and go back to Kansas?
-Derrick.
-Derrick.
-Derrick as well.
(Thorgy) I think in this
competition
you have to apply
every single second,
and I'm here to win, so people
like Chi Chi piss me off.
(RuPaul) Naomi Smalls,
you are the winner
of this week's challenge.
Derrick Barry,
shantay, you stay.
Robbie Turner, sashay away.
<i>[smooth music]</i>
(Naomi Smalls) Oh,
no more chicken wings.
That was an emotional one.
This has been
such a rocky road for me.
<i>I know there's</i>
<i>at least three queens</i>
<i>in the room that</i>
<i>want to see me go home.</i>
[sighs]
Oh.
You broke down, girl,
at the end.
-That monologue.
-You were like,
"Oh, my God, thank you
for the Academy Award."
You don't understand
how long it was.
This is the most
emotional roller coaster
I've ever been on.
It's such a struggle
for me to be
around such creative people.
And it just crumbled down
on me today.
And I'm like, "I know the
'I'm a slave for you' dance."
[sobs]
I'm so sorry.
[sniffles]
May I leave the stage now?
[laughter]
(Derick Barry) Chi Chi,
how are you feeling?
You got emotional
on the runway today too.
It's just hard when your
hard work doesn't come across.
I feel like you guys
don't look at me
as if I'm trying hard enough,
when it's-- it's not that.
Chi Chi will never recover
from this bad decision.
I will never forget that
she wasted our time yesterday.
I just feel misunderstood.
Clearly,
Chi Chi is the next to go
and Derrick's the next to go.
Oh, man.
Either one of them, who cares?
They're the next to go.
<i>[dramatic music]</i>
<i>[car engine starts]</i>
<i>The winner</i>
<i>of "RuPaul's Drag Race"</i>
<i>receives a one-year supply</i>
<i>of Anastasia</i>
<i>Beverly Hills cosmetics</i>
<i>and a cash prize</i>
<i>of $100,000.</i>
<i>With extra special</i>
<i>guest judges</i>
Thomas Roberts
and Miss Vivica A. Fox.
(Naomi Smalls)
Yes! Ooh!
(Bob the Drag Queen)
We're not in Kansas anymore.
[laughs]
[siren wails]
Whoo, girl.
(RuPaul)<i> She done</i>
<i>already done had herses.</i>
<i>Hey, racers.</i>
-Hey, girl.
-Hi.
<i>Good queens finish last,</i>
<i>but shady queens</i>
<i>rule the world,</i>
<i>so if you ain't got nothing</i>
<i>nice to say about somebody,</i>
<i>take out an ad.</i>
<i>This was paid for by citizens</i>
<i>against Lady Bunny.</i>
-Yes!
-[laughs]
Hello, hello, hello.
(all) Hi.
Ladies,
for a little morale boost,
I've invited some company.
[gasps]
Oh, Pit Crew.
Oh, look, they brought
their bunk buddies...
-Hi, guys.
-Oh!
And designer Andrew Christian.
-Hi.
-Hello there.
Ladies, America's
next drag superstar
needs to use her intuition
to make important decisions
in the blink
of a false eyelash.
Now, this is how we do it.
I share a fun fact about one
of our Andrew Christian models,
and then you determine
if he prefers the top
-or the bottom...
-[gasps]
Bunk. I'm talking
bunk here, ladies.
There's a giant bunk bed
right there, okay?
[laughter]
And the queen who gets
the most matches wins.
First up, Derrick Barry.
"The Golden Girl" character
Jason most identifies
with is Blanche Devereaux.
-I would say bottom.
-All right.
Get on down there, Jason.
Peter prefers
his coffee black.
Oh.
I will put him on the top.
Hips don't lie.
Corey's favorite music artist
is Britney Spears.
Oh. Bottom.
That bottom is so crowded.
All right, Derrick,
we will show you your results
in a moment.
Kim Chi.
All right,
now Jason number two.
-Hello.
-Is that an Australian accent?
-It is.
-Oh. Are you from Perth?
-You have Perth-onality?
-No.
-No.
-[laughter]
All right,
Jason's favorite exercise
is chest press.
I'm gonna go with top bunk
for this one.
Go on over.
Look at me, look at me.
Naomi, Murray's favorite movie
is "Little Mermaid."
-Oh.
-Bottom bunk?
I'll drink to that.
All right, Miles'
spirit animal is...
Nicole Richie.
I'm gonna say top bunk.
I'm gonna put Miles
on the top bunk.
-Bottom bunk.
-Okay.
[laughter]
Make room for Miles.
Welcome back, ladies.
Now let's debunk
all the rumors.
Boys, show us your
bunk preference, please.
-[laughter]
-Ex-squeeze me?
Just one top
in all of West Hollywood?
[laughter]
My goodness.
All right, the winner
of today's mini challenge is...
Derrick Barry.
-I won.
-[cheers and applause]
You've won a prize package
from Casper mattresses
valued at $2,000.
Yes.
And for our hungry viewers,
we're posting photos of
our bunk buddies at logotv.com.
Bye!
Ladies, now, this
being an election year,
I'm throwing your wigs
into the ring
as the first drag president
of these United States
of America.
-[cheers and applause]
-All right.
For this week's
maxi challenge,
you'll be working in pairs
to create your own
presidential campaign ads.
You need to both
promote yourself
and smear your opponent.
#shadypolitics.
[laughs]
Now, I polled the judges
to figure out
who's your number one
political adversary.
The first race
is Thorgy Thor
versus Chi Chi DeVayne.
-Ooh.
-[laughs]
<i>(Chi Chi) Oh, shit.</i>
This bitch just read me
for filth on the runway.
The next race is Kim Chi
versus Naomi Smalls.
[laughs]
And that leaves
Derrick Barry
versus Bob The Drag Queen.
Fuck.
It's fucking Derrick Barry.
He's so easily offended.
So now I have a challenge
where I have to make jokes
about Derrick.
I'm like, "Is he gonna
flip out on me again?"
Gentlemen,
start your engines,
and may
the shadiest politician win.
All right, let's do it.
Shit.
<i>(Thorgy) So I get paired</i>
<i>with Chi Chi</i>
because I called Chi Chi's ass
out last week on the runway,
<i>but I'm happy</i>
<i>to work with Chi Chi</i>
<i>'cause I will outshine her.</i>
[laughs]
My funny thing is that
I'm actually a terrible tyrant.
<i>(Thorgy)</i>
<i>I immediately was like,</i>
[trilling tongue]
"Oh! Oh!
Ooh, this is gonna be fun."
<i>And I wrote 30 pages.</i>
"Ads may be no longer
than 45 seconds."
Shit.
I have so much material.
I don't want to leave
any of it out.
Damn, Thorgy.
Like, you just
got too much going on.
You've got to edit, edit, edit.
This is going
to be impossible.
I want to try to create you
as, like, a supervillain,
so I want shots
of you in the video,
like, like, doing this.
<i>(Bob) For today's challenge,</i>
<i>we have to come up with</i>
<i>a presidential campaign ad</i>
that promotes ourselves
but at the same time
smears the opponent.
Well, I'm obviously
gonna call you ratchet.
I want to play up
on this idea
that you're not smart,
and that I'm really smart.
<i>(Derrick Barry) We have</i>
<i>butted heads before,</i>
so every team is gonna hope
that Bob and I fail.
I'm down for that.
I want ours to be the best.
<i>But we both want to win,</i>
and that's the kind of energy
we need right now.
Why should Bob The Drag Queen
be president?
Because I'm louder
than everyone else.
Shh!
I'm the loudest one.
Shut up, Bob.
[laughs]
Oh, my God, Bob,
shut the fuck up.
Whenever Bob
succeeds at anything,
Thorgy always comes for him.
<i>Thorgy really</i>
<i>wants to beat Bob.</i>
I think that's, like, kind of,
like, her personal vendetta
in this competition.
<i>They're both</i>
<i>from the same place,</i>
and I think Thorgy
just really wants to be,
<i>like, the New York queen.</i>
[laughs]
It's gonna be weird
having to do, like,
insult each other
when we're, like, friends.
We're not gonna be like,
"You're a bitch."
"No, you're a bitch.
You're ugly."
"Well, you're ugly too."
It's hard 'cause
you're not a booger.
<i>Kim Chi</i>
<i>and Naomi are not gonna</i>
<i>be smearing each other enough.</i>
They are just
acting like fucking
Chia Pets in the corner,
and they're just so adorable.
I'm just gonna say,
like, she was caught
wearing flats onstage.
Like, stuff like that.
-I mean, work on it.
-[chuckles] I hate you.
Hello, hello, hello.
(all) Hello.
My fellow femocrats,
now, in a moment,
you'll meet with
your campaign advisers,
Michelle Visage
and Carson Kressley.
-Whoo!
-What, what.
And tomorrow on the runway,
the category is
black-and-white movie realness.
(all) Ooh.
So good luck,
and don't fuck it up.
[applause]
-Hey.
-Welcome, ladies.
(Derrick Barry)
It's our turn to go in
and shoot
with Michelle and Carson.
I need to redeem myself.
For me, this is go big
or go home.
Okay, whose campaign
are we doing first?
-Doing mine first.
-Derrick Barry for president.
Action.
Bob roams the streets
of New York City
stealing
from defenseless people.
Cut.
Nancy Grace it out
on that one, overly serious.
-All right.
-And action.
Bob is only comfortable
stealing from defenseless people
on the mean streets
of New York City.
(Michelle Visage)
Cut.
Derrick is doing this parody
on, like, creepy
Republican white women,
and it's really funny to me.
-That was good?
-(Michelle) So much better.
-Okay.
-Let's do the B-roll.
What's your first setup?
It is Bob in a hoodie,
and he'll be stealing money
from the Pit Crew.
That's not
stereotyping at all.
Not at all.
I hope there's
no Skittles involved.
No Arizona tea either.
(Michelle Visage)
And action. Cut.
Bob, creep in like this,
just to get into the first one.
And action.
[maniacal laughter]
(Michelle Visage)
Cut.
Print.
Done.
All right, Bob,
your turn, baby.
So can I get, like,
the big couch over here?
I'm going for a little bit
of Michelle Obama
meets Hillary Clinton so,
like, Blackie Onassis.
Here we go.
Action.
I believe in strong
drag family values.
Derrick Barry
only had one baby,
for breakfast.
[laughter]
That was great.
So now we have to do
the Derrick stuff, right?
There's a scene in the end
where she eats the baby.
Oh, that's good.
That's, like,
Norman Bates shit.
(Michelle Visage)
Okay, good. Ready?
Action.
Why?
Derrick is going in.
Go with it, go with it.
[growling]
[laughter]
Great, cut.
-That was awesome.
-Good job.
I'm really shocked.
<i>Derrick has never</i>
<i>let go like this.</i>
-Fabulous.
-We did it.
-Hi.
-Hi.
Who's going first? Naomi.
-Yes.
-Okay.
(Naomi) So my platform
is being a supermodel,
and I want the whole world
to look beautiful.
And action.
America's drag president
is signing up for
speeches, debates, interviews--
Cut. Deliver it more.
Punch the words, you know?
Action.
America's first drag president
must speak as--
Fuck. Sorry.
Cut.
It's all about attitude.
This is a shady
political campaign.
I know
you know how to be shady.
[laughter]
Have you been watching
this season?
[laughs]
For my thing,
I'm using food as a metaphor,
and I'm smearing Naomi
by how skinny she is,
and we shouldn't trust her.
The biggest worry
I have for this challenge
is being able to speak clearly
and the judges being able to
understand my sense of "humor."
Here we go.
And action.
She acts like
she's the skinniest queen,
but her waist
isn't even 19 inches.
More forcefully.
Remember to enunciate.
-All right.
-Action.
She acts like she's
the skinniest queen,
but her waist
isn't even 19 inches.
Cut.
I think I'm seeing the words
as they're coming out of
your mouth, like, on paper.
Let that all go.
Let's move on.
Moving on.
Let's do the B-roll.
Action.
-What a fat ass.
-Cut.
The inflection
should go down at the end.
Not, "What a fat ass?"
But, "What a fat ass."
What a fat ass.
(both) What a fat ass.
What a fat ass.
You went up again.
I'm nervous for Kim
just because she did get
a lot of notes,
and she's not
feeling confident,
so I'm scared
that my friend could go home.
-Good, move on.
-Okay.
Thorgy Thor
and Chi Chi DeVayne.
-Hi.
-Hi.
Hi.
I ain't gonna lie.
I'm a little nervous,
but I just want to present
in a professional way.
All right, Chi Chi,
you're up.
And action.
Thorgy Thor
is always caught looking
like she works
for children's parties.
Do you really want Bozo
running your country?
-I think not.
-Cut.
Okay, you sounded like
John Wayne,
which is really weird.
[laughs]
I say lose the deep voice.
It's a little too literal
and deadpan.
Like, it needs
a little bit of flair.
Yes.
You got that great
Louisiana accent.
I'm struggling with this
because where I'm from,
being country
is not the thing to be.
<i>I kind of want</i>
<i>to seem presidential.</i>
Damn.
Thorgy Thor for president.
Go for it, and give it
all you got.
I'm just gonna shorten it.
-Okay.
-All right.
And action.
My name is Thorgy Thor,
and I need your vote to become
the first drag queen president
of the United States of America.
[laughs]
Good job. Next scene.
Um...
[quietly]
"Freshmen year of college,
"threw up in the dorm.
[muttering indistinctly]
"She...
Comforts."
That's a better word.
Okay, let's hear it.
[laughs]
Read, lady.
Sorry.
No, I just like to kid.
(Chi Chi)
<i>Here we go again.</i>
Thorgy is changing ideas
as she's going along.
What is this?
What is that?
Ticktock, ticktock.
(Chi Chi)<i> She's just</i>
<i>all over the place,</i>
and it's pissing me off.
-It looks expensive.
-Focus, Thorgy. Focus.
-Sorry.
-And action.
Chi Chi's hand always
goes straight for the bottle..
-Great, cut. Perfect.
-That was excellent.
I think we got everything.
-No, B-roll now.
-Oh, yeah.
Fuck,
I forgot about all this.
All right, this
is gonna be simple.
-It's gonna be easy.
-(Michelle Visage) Action.
What are they gonna do
with canned food, by the way?
[Thorgy Thor chuckles]
Um...
Do you want a shot
of Chi Chi drinking booze?
'Cause you said her arm always
reaches for the booze.
-I think I'm good.
-You're done with Chi Chi?
Yeah, that's it.
Okay. Thank you, ladies.
<i>[lively music]</i>
Bring your ass up in here.
Walk into the club
with this purse.
-Bam.
-[laughter]
I'm gonna do my makeup
right away.
It's time to get
ready for today's runway:
black-and-white realness.
We are taking inspiration from
what Detox did on her season.
Are you really
doing all whiteface?
Yes.
Someone to finally stand up
for white people.
[laughter]
Bob, you're quite a political
person, if you will.
I like getting into politics.
It's actually fun.
<i>(Bob) My slogan is actually</i>
<i>my real-life slogan.</i>
Bob The Drag Queen:
a queen for the people.
I live my life by this.
I was in Albany,
in the capitol building,
when marriage equality passed.
In 2010, me and a couple
of my friends
decided to get together
and do something
about the inequalities
we experience
in the gay community,
<i>and we decided to do something</i>
<i>called Drag Queen</i>
<i>Weddings for Equality,</i>
<i>and we would do</i>
<i>these demonstrations</i>
<i>in Times Square</i>
<i>every single Saturday,</i>
until there was marriage
equality in New York state,
<i>(Bob) and I got arrested</i>
<i>at Bryant Park</i>
<i>for blocking traffic.</i>
<i>They fucking</i>
<i>threw my ass in jail,</i>
<i>in full drag, girl.</i>
Like, you don't have
to go get arrested
but just something,
something as simple as voting.
It is really important
because politicians,
they literally make very real
and very, very important
decisions for you.
Like, you could've done maybe
something about it
before it happened.
Well, you can definitely
do something about it.
So, Kim Chi.
Yes, Derrick Barry?
Did you grow up
in North or South Korea?
I grew up in--
[laughs]
You can't leave
North Korea.
It's not somewhere
where you, like--
-It's not a vacation spot.
-And if you leave,
like, your entire,
like, family,
your friends, like,
all of them will be killed.
I was born here in America,
and I went to elementary school
in South Korea.
Would you go back
to South Korea or no?
Oh, definitely, but there's
no drag culture there.
There's hardly
any gay culture.
Wow.
One day
I would love to be able
to perform in South Korea
and actually have people
come out to see me.
<i>(Kim Chi) I may be the first</i>
<i>Korean drag queen</i>
to ever be featured
on television.
Like, Americans
have it so good here.
They don't even
realize it, you know?
So true.
So, so true.
<i>["Cover Girl"</i>
<i>by RuPaul playing]</i>
<i>[laughs]</i>
<i>And, what?</i>
[applause]
Welcome to the main stage
of "RuPaul's Drag Race."
My running mate,
Michelle Visage.
How you doing?
I may or may not
be sitting on a hanging chad.
[laughter]
Style superstar
Carson Kressley.
Now, do you consider
yourself bipartisan?
I do, but the medication
seems to be working.
Hot on the campaign trail,
it's Thomas Roberts.
Hi, Ru. I'm here
to make America great again
with you through RuPaul-itics.
Let's make America
great again.
And the secretary of sickening,
Vivica A. Fox.
Strange, strange, strange.
I'm not wearing panties.
[laughter]
This week
we challenged our queens
to create shady political ads.
And tonight,
do not adjust your sets,
because the category is
black-and-white realness.
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.
First up, here's
Bob The Drag Queen.
-Bob the joker.
-Uh-oh.
<i>(Bob) I decided to do a look</i>
<i>inspired the movie</i>
<i>"Freaks," so I look creepy.</i>
<i>I look gorgeous.</i>
<i>I'm serving, girl.</i>
-Harlequin romance novel.
-Oh, and the sneer.
I like that.
Up next, Derrick Barry.
Yes, a little black dress.
-Oh.
-Hey.
<i>(Derrick Barry) I'm</i>
<i>representing old Hollywood,</i>
<i>and this is</i>
<i>a different look for me.</i>
<i>I feel like a movie star.</i>
(RuPaul) Now, she's pumping some
Yvonne De Carlo realness here.
-Yes, she is!
-Lily Munster.
Naomi Smalls.
-Baby?
-Oh, damn.
<i>(Naomi Smalls) Raven is</i>
<i>such a huge inspiration.</i>
<i>I really just want to</i>
<i>pay homage</i>
<i>to how amazing she is.</i>
(RuPaul)
She has padded.
(Michelle Visage)
Someone found a couch.
(RuPaul) Yeah.
What's your sleep number?
[laughter]
-(RuPaul) Oh, oh, oh, oh.
-(Michelle) Other way.
(RuPaul)
This is Kim Chi, y'all.
(Vivica Fox)
She is just giving us drama.
<i>(Kim Chi) My idea is</i>
<i>a sad-looking French clown</i>
<i>in a "Sin City" setting.</i>
(RuPaul) Wrong way.
(Carson Kressley)
I'll get her back.
(RuPaul) The mime has come
to lip-synch for your life.
-Okay?
-[Michelle laughs]
-(RuPaul) Thorgy Thor.
-Oh.
(Carson Kressley)
She's got Bette Davis thighs.
It's hammer time.
<i>(Thorgy) I'm giving you Mae</i>
<i>West meets Carrie Bradshaw.</i>
<i>My idea is to put them together</i>
<i>in a hodgepodge</i>
<i>to create my own Thorgy look.</i>
(RuPaul)
She looks a little ashy.
-(Vivica A. Fox) Yes.
-(RuPaul) Lotion up, girl.
Lotion up.
[laughter]
(RuPaul)
Chi Chi DeVayne.
-(judges) Ooh!
-(RuPaul) She's gone Hollywood.
-(Vivica A. Fox) Sparkle, honey.
-[laughter]
<i>(Chi Chi) I'm wearing a gown</i>
<i>that was passed down</i>
<i>from my drag mom,</i>
<i>so it's special,</i>
<i>and my makeup is giving you</i>
<i>"Dead President" realness,</i>
<i>honey.</i>
(Michelle) She brought
her Louisiana roadkill
with her too.
(Carson) No possums were harmed
in the making of this outfit.
-(Michelle) Yes.
(RuPaul)
Welcome, candidates.
First up,
Bob The Drag Queen.
Let's take a look
at your shady political ad.
[claps]
Hi.
I'm Bob The Drag Queen,
a queen for the people.
And as a public servant,
I believe in serving the people.
That's why I want BJs
for every single American.
That's right, better jobs
for every American.
Buy yourself something pretty.
I believe in
strong drag family values.
I adopted these three
needy drag babies,
and Derrick Barry
only had one baby...
for breakfast.
<i>[eerie music]</i>
[laughter]
[chomping]
Bob The Drag Queen
has a plan...
the gay agenda--
and it's designed by lesbians,
so you know it works.
[laughter]
Bob The Drag Queen
for president.
Why?
Because I didn't
eat a fucking baby.
This ad was paid for
by my Uncle Steve.
He got money, girl.
[laughter]
I loved that
you threw so much shade
that you made your opponent
look like an absolute maniac.
You did an excellent job.
Strange.
You have a very small
amount of time
to tell your story,
to get the laugh.
I think it was tight,
and it worked.
You demonstrated gravitas.
I'm gonna throw
a challenge at you.
I would love to see
a fully-realized
glamasaurus Rex.
Okay.
All right, next up,
Derrick Barry.
Think Derrick Barry
because this fairy
thinks fairly.
As a Las Vegas local,
I'm comfortable taking
a gamble with your money.
However, Bob is only comfortable
stealing from defenseless people
on the mean streets
of New York City.
[cackles]
I'm a very traditional woman.
However, Bob spends
his time dropping acid
with his friend Betty
and engaging in orgies
with his friend Thorgy.
I'm gonna spend my time
incorporating drag 101 classes
in schools across America.
However, Bob visits
sick children in the hospital,
and instead of
making them laugh,
he laughs at them.
[laughing]
Who is Bob,
and what is he hiding?
[cackles]
This ad was paid for
by Chad Michaels,
All Stars Winner,
celebrity female impersonator
-of the world.
-[laughter]
-That was good, Derrick.
-Good job.
You came across
like you didn't really believe
what you were saying,
which is perfect
for a politician.
I mean, you nailed it.
It was Michele Bachmann
realness.
If you really were going
for Michele Bachmann, though,
you would've looked
at the wrong camera.
Baby,
the shade on your opponent,
it was dead-on.
You went in
on your competition.
It was an actual,
true smear.
Runway look,
a little underwhelmed.
Don't just give us that same
old kind of pretty makeup.
Just show us something
completely different.
Up next, Naomi Smalls.
Beauty is pain,
and I believe America
needs to toughen up.
A president needs to be
able to carry herself.
How is Kim Chi gonna do that
when she can't even
walk in heels?
[laughing]
America's first drag president
must give speeches,
interviews, and debates.
It's gonna be hard
to understand Kim Chi
when you're dodging saliva
through that strong lisp.
[laughter]
When I'm elected, there will be
no more parking tickets,
and officers will be trained to
give free injectable cosmetics.
Free Restylane for all!
I'm Naomi Smalls, and I promise
to represent you fiercely.
[camera flashes]
This ad was paid for
by citizens
against non-lacefront wigs.
[laughter]
You made some campaign
promises
that really appeal to me.
[laughter]
I loved that
your commercial was really
all about being
a drag president,
about being fabulous.
Tonight on the runway, wow.
I mean, you look ultra
glamorous.
(Carson Kressley) And then
the hip with the padding.
Yeah, the padding
is phenomenal.
I think it's my favorite look
on the runway.
Thank you.
Up next, Kim Chi.
Let's take a look.
Hi, I'm Kim Chi,
and you want me
as your first drag president.
Naomi Smalls says
beauty is pain,
but is she aware of
the consequences of her actions?
America is a kitchen
that needs a strong chef
and never trust a skinny cook.
Small body, small mind.
She thinks she's
the skinniest queen,
but her waist is 22 inches.
What a fat ass.
Shady gays believe in no fats,
no fems, and no Asians.
As someone who is
all of the above,
I understand your pain.
My name is Kim Chi,
and say hello to yellow.
This ad was paid
out of my own pocket
because no one cares.
Do you?
[laughter]
When you came on,
you didn't break.
You did the whole mime thing.
But the best part
was your makeup.
Absolutely stunning.
But your ad.
I don't think it really got
the job done as far as
what the challenge was,
which was to be shady.
We did have
to work quite a bit
with you and your inflections.
-It was challenging.
-It was challenging.
It's just--I don't think
you're a big speaker.
I do have, like, a bit
of a fear of public speaking,
so to be able
to just enunciate clearly
is something I've struggled
with for a long time,
and I tried my best and--
Are you okay, boo?
Yeah, I'm fine.
I wouldn't be so hard
on myself if I were you.
It's just that you've got
some really tough competitors,
and we're down to that place
where we have to really
give harsh critiques, you know?
-Next up, Thorgy Thor.
-Hello.
Let's take a look
at your political shadiness.
Shoo.
Hello, good Americans.
My name is Thorgy Thor,
and I need your vote to become
the first drag queen president
of the United States of America.
You need somebody you can trust.
I've never told a lie,
and I'm not about to begin now.
This is my real hair.
My opponent Chi Chi DeVayne
once drank too many
wine coolers in college,
and she threw up on the floor.
Now she visits
recovering addicts
and feeds food to the homeless?
I'm not buying it.
Chi Chi's hand always
goes straight for the bottle.
My top priority is health care.
That's why I'm sending
a very expensive bottle
of champagne
to every home in America.
Cheers to
your health and mine.
[laughs]
Whoo!
Thorgy Thor for president,
because I'm more powerful
than you.
Hmm.
-[laughs]
-All right.
[applause]
Let's start
with your runway look.
It's not the most glamorous look
on the runway.
I think you look
like a dead Boy George.
I was very entertained
by your character.
I thought it was
a little Joan Crawford,
Faye Dunaway...
-Thank you.
-Over-the-top.
But I got totally confused
when you were
passing out the food,
and then you didn't see
anything about the booze,
and I was kind of--
I got a little lost on that.
Michelle even asked you,
"Don't you want to do, like,
a boozy cutaway of Chi Chi?"
And we never saw that.
And in an ad of this length,
you need to show us,
not tell us,
so that was a fail for me.
There was, like, no smear
in that smear campaign.
Also, there was no tagline,
like, no paid-for line.
The difficult thing
was to cut down
exactly what material
I wanted to come across
with this character.
There were too many ideas.
That's been
a critique of you
throughout the competition
is learning how to edit.
You're right.
I could keep--
I always just keep going,
keep going, and going.
It is difficult to shut
my thought processes down.
Thank you, Thorgy.
Up next, Chi Chi DeVayne.
Okay.
<i>I'm Chi Chi DeVayne,</i>
<i>and I approve</i>
<i>this message, girl.</i>
I'm Chi Chi DeVayne,
and I should be
your next drag president
because I'm real, chill,
and my makeup don't peel.
<i>But my opponent Thorgy Thor</i>
<i>is always caught looking</i>
<i>like she works</i>
<i>for children's parties.</i>
<i>Do you really want a clown</i>
<i>running your country?</i>
<i>I think not.</i>
Meanwhile,
I'm working to ensure
that every American
has a pot to piss in
and a window to throw it out.
And in that same pot,
there'll be chitlins
boiling for all.
<i>Thorgy want America</i>
<i>to walk around</i>
<i>with horrible hip pads</i>
<i>that resemble Peggy Bundy.</i>
<i>Who wants to walk around</i>
<i>with a FUPA?</i>
America says,
"Not me, Thorgy Thor."
(voice)<i> This message</i>
<i>has been paid for</i>
<i>by citizens who like to eat</i>
<i>rare and unusual animal parts.</i>
-Oh!
-[laughter]
Well.
I really love
this sassy character.
However, your smear campaign,
you could've drug her ass
through the mud
a whole lot more,
is all I'm gonna
really tell you.
The look was a bit
shocking to me.
You're a drag queen president.
I didn't feel like there was
any "zjooshing" up.
You were, like,
rocking the Wanda Sykes
as assistant
in "Monster-in-Law" look.
I wasn't a fan.
I do think there really
wasn't any smear in there,
and I think for both of you,
you were too nice to each other.
Just remember
what the challenge is.
You came in
in kind of a character,
and I think we just had
to push you a little bit
for you to be in your skin.
And that's the key for you,
is to just own
that bayou charm.
[sighs]
Where I come from,
it's damn hard
to get out of the ghetto,
to get out of that,
and I think that's why I kind
of--I don't want to be ghetto.
You know what I mean?
Because I feel like--
Let me just tell you this.
Let me stop you here.
Just be you.
Honey, that's why we sent you
a plane ticket.
You know, we don't need you
to be somebody else.
I do want to say
that this my sixth season
doing this,
and I have not seen such
a strong set of girls before.
There is not one of you
that was terrible at all.
This is what
we're up against as judges.
Thank you, ladies.
While you untuck backstage,
the judges
and I will deliberate.
Just between us swing voters,
what do you think?
-Bob The Drag Queen.
-Bob nailed it.
She's great at the comedy.
She was great at the writing.
She was great at the acting.
Bob had gravitas
in that campaign.
You are in love
with that word.
I still don't even
know what it means.
-I know, I want to--tell me.
-It means "heft."
Like a fat ass kind of heft?
Gravit-ass.
(RuPaul) Derrick Barry.
When she was Derrick Bachmann,
I think she smeared Bob,
and she smeared him well.
She had a really good, campy,
fun time with him.
Those two have a history
of being rivals,
and they made it
work for them.
This is like what
I do every week
with Michelle Visage.
[laughter]
Naomi Smalls.
She was the only one
that threw actual shade.
And she's so likeable.
Now, that runway,
she was padded for Jesus.
Gorgeous.
Naomi has risen
to the occasion,
and that's the kind of progress
we love in this competition.
(RuPaul) Kim Chi.
Her shade part
with Naomi was "eh."
I didn't know whether or not
she was doing a campaign ad
or if she was doing a food ad.
But this kid
is so imaginative,
and then she brought up
the no fats, no fems,
no Asians thing,
which was very political,
the fact that gay people
are fighting for fairness.
But, you know, on Craigslist,
you're free to be as racist
and body shaming as possible.
-Really?
-Yeah.
I'm gonna take that
off my profile.
[laughter]
(RuPaul)
Thorgy Thor.
This runway tonight
was a swing and a miss.
I know she's wacky
and different,
but it should be cohesive.
The political campaign,
love the commitment
to the character
but it was kind
of too much about her.
She didn't do any
of the smear campaign at all,
and when she did, it was like,
"Oh, enough about you
but back to me."
Lots of ideas,
but you've got to land a punch.
Chi Chi DeVayne.
Tonight on the runway,
that is the best she's looked
this entire competition.
Unfortunately,
I was not a fan of
the political campaign.
That wasn't somebody
that could be
the first drag queen president.
When Chi Chi walked out
to meet Carson and I,
I literally though it was
James Brown coming out.
[laughter]
Silence.
Mm.
I've made my decision.
Bring back my girls,
Mr. Gorbachev!
Bob The Drag Queen
and Derrick Barry,
condragulations,
you are both the winners
of this week's challenge.
-[applause]
-Congrats, baby.
(RuPaul) You've each won
an original couture gown
from Mountbatten Concepts.
Oh, wow.
(Derrick Barry)
<i>I'm on cloud nine.</i>
This is the moment
I've been waiting for.
Pleasure meeting all of you.
Thank you.
Thank you, all of you.
<i>I'm glad</i>
<i>that we won together.</i>
Working with Derrick, I've
learned to like and respect him.
Naomi Smalls
and Kim Chi,
you are safe.
[sighs]
You may join the other girls.
Thank you so much.
Thorgy Thor,
Chi Chi DeVayne,
I'm sorry, my dears,
but you are up for elimination.
<i>(Chi Chi) I do not deserve</i>
<i>to be in the bottom.</i>
I ain't going home.
Two queens stand before me.
Ladies, this is
your last chance
to impress me
and save yourself
from elimination.
The time has come
for you to lip-synch
for your life!
<i>(Thorgy) I am a performer</i>
<i>through and through.</i>
One of us has to go home.
She is.
Good luck,
and don't fuck it up.
(female vocalist)
[beads rattling]
Wow.
[cheers and applause]
Ladies,
I've made my decision.
Chi Chi DeVayne,
shantay, you stay.
Thank you.
I love you, baby.
I love you always.
Thorgy Thor,
you brought the BK
to the RDR.
And, girl,
I ain't gonna L-I-E.
[laughs]
We loved every minute of it.
Now sashay away.
Thank you, Ru, so much.
[applause]
(Thorgy)
I love you guys.
-Bye, Thorgy.
-Bye, guys.
Witty catchphrase,
you know what I mean?
[laughter]
<i>(Thorgy) Ru, I think you made</i>
<i>a little bit of a mistake,</i>
but you have
your reasons for things.
<i>This show is a lot harder</i>
<i>than you think,</i>
so judge us kindly.
<i>I don't regret a single thing.</i>
<i>I will look at this</i>
<i>as a catalyst</i>
<i>towards more greatness.</i>
I love you, Ru.
Condragulations, ladies.
Now, remember,
if you can't love yourself,
how in the hell are you
and you and you
gonna love somebody else?
Can I get an amen in here?
[together]
Amen.
All right.
Now let the music play.
<i>["Die Tomorrow"</i>
<i>by RuPaul playing]</i>


-Previously, on
"RuPaul's Drag Race"...
It's time to play
The Snatch Game!
-How you doing, RuPaul?
-Hee hee!
-Uzo Abu-boo left the stage.
[laughter]
-What do you do for bunions?
-Well, I was told that you can
get them shaved off.
I'm about to get that done.
-[RuPaul] Naomi Smalls.
-It's becoming
quite predictable
to come out in lingerie.
Maybe you should
switch it up now.
-[RuPaul] Acid Betty.
-I need, like, a nasal,
angry Southern voice.
And she leans in like she's
in your living room.
-I wish I had you as a coach.
-Okay.
-Bob The Drag Queen,
you are the winner
of this week's challenge.
Naomi Smalls,
shantay, you stay.
Acid Betty, sashay away.
<i>[electronic music]</i>
-What a day.
-I'm really glad
that Naomi's still here.
<i>If Naomi had gone home,</i>
<i>I would've lost a great friend.</i>
And Acid Betty's gone.
-"Ladies, you have been
touched by fierceness.
Bob, love you.
See Jew in New York."
-Betty has
the most iconic looks,
<i>and that's my Brooklyn girl.</i>
<i>But she was always just,</i>
<i>like, in a bad mood,</i>
<i>putting things down.</i>
She deserved to go.
-It was literally the worst
feeling I've ever felt.
I'm just very embarrassed
and disappointed in myself.
I let Ru down, and I know
that he's disappointed in me,
and that's like
the worst feeling ever.
I'm so scared now.
Feel like I have to wear, like,
a fucking turtleneck
that's to the floor.
-Was everything else you
brought here a bra and a panty?
-No.
-Two piece and a biscuit?
[laughter]
-I mean, I work hard
for my body and I love my body.
-I don't think the judges
are telling you
to be ashamed of your body.
I think they just
want to see one time
where you show them
something different.
-Where you wear clothing.
[laughter]
<i>-[Naomi Smalls] The other</i>
<i>queens think that what I do</i>
doesn't take a lot of effort,
and that's totally not true.
I put tons of work
into my drag aesthetic,
so it's frustrating.
Well, Bob, congratulations.
-Thank you.
-Yeah, congratulations, Bob.
-I had a lot of fun.
-Yeah.
-My reaction to Bob's win
is this...
Always.
I'm just, like, sick of it.
-I came in a close second,
though--they really liked me.
-I'm the first one to win two,
I won two!
I'm gonna try to get three.
Has anyone ever
won three before?
-Bob, shut up.
-I'm really proud of myself
and I feel like the other girls
are really gunning for me now.
They're like, "Oh, you think
you all that, bitch?"
<i>But I don't mean</i>
<i>to come across that way.</i>
I'm just having fun.
I'm just, like, living my dream,
making people laugh,
which is me being me.
-Have you ever played Jenga?
That's Bob.
<i>Like, slowly he's being</i>
<i>built up,</i>
but sooner or later,
the foundation is gonna crumble
and he's gonna take a big fall.
<i>[dramatic music]</i>
-Whoo!
<i>[car engine starts]</i>
<i>-The winner</i>
<i>of "RuPaul's Drag Race"</i>
<i>receives a one-year supply</i>
<i>of Anastasia</i>
<i>Beverly Hills cosmetics</i>
<i>and a cash prize</i>
<i>of $100,000.</i>
<i>With extra special</i>
<i>guest judges</i>
<i>Todrick Hall</i>
<i>and Marc Jacobs!</i>
<i>[upbeat music]</i>
-[chuckling]
<i>-[Derrick Barry] Now that we're</i>
<i>in the top seven,</i>
I have no idea
who could go home next.
You can have
your ugly purse back.
-Damn.
[alarm sounds]
[all cheering]
-Ooh, girl!
-Girl!
<i>-She done already done</i>
<i>had herses!</i>
<i>My queens, are you</i>
<i>a friend of Dorothy's,</i>
<i>or just plain wicked?</i>
<i>Just click your tongue</i>
<i>and repeat after me.</i>
<i>There's no place like</i>
<i>"Drag Race."</i>
[clicks tongue]
[all click tongues]
<i>Okay?</i>
<i>Okay?</i>
Hello, hello, hello!
[overlapping greetings]
We've got company.
Close the door behind you.
What you think this is?
Ladies, say hello
to Marc Snetiker.
Snetiker, please.
[laughter]
He's a writer
with "Entertainment Weekly."
-Oh.
-I'm so excited to be here, Ru.
Our "EW" readers love to read
the "Drag Race" recaps
every week.
-Well, I'm glad
you brought up reading.
Because in the great tradition
of "Paris Is Burning"...
<i>[dramatic music]</i>
The library is about
to be open, darling.
[all cheering]
Because reading is what?
all: Fundamental!
-That's right.
First up, Chi Chi DeVayne.
Come on down, honey.
[cheering]
-Chi Chi!
-Yeah!
[laughter]
-All right, Thorgy Thor.
Girl, I love you so much,
I don't know whether
to give you a hug
or put some change in a cup.
[laughter]
Bob The Drag Queen.
You may be from New York, honey,
but those feet
are still from Mississippi.
[laughter]
-Love it.
-Chi Chi, your drag is just
like turkey neck.
Cheap, and no one wants it.
[laughter]
-Wow.
-Naomi Smalls.
Your wardrobe reminds me of
a legendary "Drag Race" queen.
Nicole Paige Brooks.
[laughter]
-Nice.
-Shade!
Who knew that was lurking
underneath that--
-We all knew.
-We all knew.
-Simple.
I mean Derrick.
I mean Britney.
You know, you are pretty
attractive.
I'd hit that baby one more time.
[laughter]
Bob.
Please shut up.
[laughter]
-Naomi.
No one knows whether
to call you "Ny-omi"
or "Nay-omi,"
but judging from
your runway looks,
no one's gonna be
calling you at all.
[laughter]
Bob The Drag Queen.
I had no idea
that there are different shades
of ashy.
[laughter]
-Kim Chi.
You are stomping
for the gods on the runway.
[laughter]
I just wish your drag
would get raptured.
[laughter]
Naomi. I'm gonna give you some
advice, darling.
No one's gonna
take you seriously
if you were born
after Windows 95 came out.
[laughter]
-Robbie Turner, we know
you're a vintage queen,
but do you have to smell
like mothballs too?
-Oh, fuck off.
[laughter]
-Derrick Barry.
You say it takes you an hour
to do your face.
Why does it look
like five minutes?
[laughter]
-Beauty.
-It is a known fact that
Derrick Barry is not very smart.
When she heard "Britney Spears,"
she said, "Does she?
I prefer fencing."
[laughter]
It is very hard to have
an intelligent conversation
with Derrick Barry.
The only thing harder
is Robbie Turner's wig lines.
[laughter]
Rob-bie Turn-ter!
I know you're a huge fan of
classic movies and television.
May I recommend one of my
favorite classic TV shows?
"Flipper."
[laughter]
-Oh, my goodness!
Y'all went in deep!
-I feel like I'm a lot
shadier just by being here.
[laughter]
The winner of today's
mini-challenge...
is Bob The Drag Queen.
-Whoo!
[applause]
<i>-Bob just won, again.</i>
Ugh.
-You've won jewels valued
at $1,500
<i>from Fierce Drag Jewels.</i>
-Oh, wow!
-And to see more reads,
go to logotv.com.
Let's say good-bye to Mark,
everybody!
all: Bye, Mark!
-Ladies, since you love
reading so much,
I want to share with you
my favorite book of all time,
"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz."
[applause]
This week's maxi-challenge
is your chance
to strut your stuff down
the yellow brick road.
But you won't be doing it alone.
Please welcome some
"Drag Race" super fans.
[cheers and applause]
The cast of Lifetime TV's
"Little Women: LA."
Say hello to Briana
Brittney!
Christy!
Elena!
Terra
Jasmine
And last but not least Tanya.
Now, for this
makeover challenge,
you need to create
original drag couture
for you and your partner
inspired by
one of the characters in
"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz."
#WizardsofDrag.
[laughter]
Little women of LA,
you choose the queen
you want to be your partner.
Briana, which character
do you have?
-I have the Wicked Witch,
and I actually picked Kim Chi.
[chuckles]
Hi!
-Hi!
[laughter]
-I have
the citizen of Emerald City,
and the queen I picked
is Thorgy Thor.
-Whoo!
[cheers and applause]
[laughter]
-I have the Cowardly Lion,
and the queen I picked
is Robbie Turner.
[laughter]
-Yes!
-I'm gonna be
Glinda the Good Witch,
because I'm good,
and sometimes I'm a witch.
[laughter]
And I'll take
Bob The Drag Queen.
[laughter]
-I have Tin Woodman,
and I am
100% going
with Mr. Derrick Barry!
-Whoo!
I love Terra!
<i>I've met Terra in the past,</i>
<i>and she impersonates Britney.</i>
<i>She's Mini-Britney.</i>
It's a perfect match.
-I have the Scarecrow,
and I'm taking Naomi Smalls.
-Okay.
[laughter]
[applause]
-How are you?
-Hello.
-I am Dorothy.
And I have Chi Chi!
-I love you!
[applause]
You don't play no games, baby.
I watch you
all the time.
-Now, there should be a strong
drag family resemblance.
So to help you
with your makeovers,
you'll be using
the wonderful products
<i>provided by Anastasia</i>
<i>of Beverly Hills.</i>
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.
[cheers and applause]
-Ooh, these are cool!
-Yeah!
<i>-[Thorgy Thor] This week's</i>
<i>maxi-challenge is to make over</i>
<i>the cast of "Little Women: LA,"</i>
inspired by the characters of
"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz."
-So, I'm open to anything,
because I love fashion,
and makeup,
and I'm a hair stylist.
-Me too. Yeah.
-Are you?
Whoo!
This is gonna be bomb.
<i>-I'm so excited I get Jasmine,</i>
<i>because she's gorgeous,</i>
and I'm gorgeous, and--
Like, you literally just, like,
are, like, posed like that.
-Oh, like--
-Yeah.
-Like a Scarecrow
'cause they're very still.
-Exactly.
-Oh, shoot!
-I'm excited that we
get to do some designing.
<i>I could seriously look</i>
<i>at fashion magazines</i>
from the time
Barnes &amp; Noble opens
to the time
Barnes &amp; Noble closes.
<i>I really want</i>
<i>to show the girls</i>
that I'm not just
a walking bra and panty
and I'm talented.
[chuckles]
-So tell me, like, what's
your personal style like?
-It's very vintage.
-Me too.
-My wedding was a 1940s
vintage wedding dress.
<i>-Fabulous!</i>
<i>I love that.</i>
-Yeah.
-So, the Cowardly Lion.
We're gonna make, you know,
a cute little dress
or maybe a leotard
or I don't know.
I'm thinking.
-You have a big challenge.
-I do have a big challenge,
yeah.
-Oh, Robbie.
I agree with Christy.
<i>I think he's gonna</i>
<i>have a challenge,</i>
because based on
his poodle challenge
<i>a couple episodes ago,</i>
<i>Robbie's not the best</i>
<i>at construction,</i>
and especially with somebody
much smaller.
-So how do you fit
into your group?
'Cause here's the thing.
They're sick of me winning
all the time,
so they're all like,
"Ooh, Bob wins everything.
Everyone loves Bob."
In the first season of the show
there was a photoshoot
that we did,
And the photographer were giving
me all the attention
-Terra
-Who's Terra?
-The bitchy one.
-The one right here?
-Yeah.
-I can hear you.
-I mean, I'd be lying if I said
I wasn't a little nervous.
<i>I don't know if there's anyone</i>
<i>in "The Wizard of Oz"</i>
more the opposite of who I am
than Glinda the Good Witch.
And I think, honestly, a lot of
the girls want to see me do bad.
I am nervous!
-Why?
-You know you guys are all
fucking gunning for me to lose.
-Well, of course we are.
We just want you
to trip and fall, that's all.
-Ooh, hoo, hoo!
-Sometimes it's funny to watch
other people, like, squirm.
Especially Bob.
Too real?
-Our resources
are very limited.
-You know 'Masterchef"
competition. They only give
mustard and...
-But this ain't Masterchef...
They hate me they gotta give me
some...
You are not too worried about...
-I'm just worried about
being efficient.
<i>-[Chi Chi] I'm feeling a little</i>
<i>pressured about the outfits</i>
<i>today</i>
because so far the judges
seem to not like my style.
I keep saying that
I'm like the broke queen,
you know what I mean?
I just cannot get out
of my head.
-See, you can't do that.
Don't even claim that.
Don't even have that energy.
It ain't no "if."
It ain't "I'm trying,"
or "I can't."
No.
"I am,"
and "I'm doing it."
'Cause if I could do it,
you sure could do it.
-Mm-hmm.
-I didn't let
my height to get in my way
of my dreams.
Don't think small.
<i>-[Chi Chi] The lesson in "The</i>
<i>Wonderful Wizard of Oz" for</i>
<i>Dorothy</i>
is that she's searching for
something that she already has,
<i>so maybe I have</i>
<i>everything I need</i>
and I am a real-life Dorothy.
-Whatever you do,
I'ma wear it,
strut it,
and be confident in it, okay?
'Cause you know that's how
I roll.
[both laugh]
-Hello, hello, hello!
both: Hi!
-Hello!
-Hello!
-Hi, Kim Chi.
Hi, Briana.
-Hi, Ru.
-Hello.
-Now, Kim Chi, you're known
for really high concept,
Leigh Bowery style.
-Yeah.
-How does that translate
to a little person?
-Well, I ask her, like,
what are some of
your style inspirations?
And she said Jessica Rabbit
and...
both: Betty Boop.
-Cartoon makeup is
what I love doing,
so it's a match
made in heaven.
-Because of your
knowledge of design,
there are high expectations.
Does that make you nervous?
-It doesn't make me nervous,
'cause I feel like the first
challenge, I won,
and then I was in the bottom
right after that
and I've been safe since,
so I want to knock
this one out of the park.
-Good, good.
I'm looking forward to this.
-All right.
I'll not let you down.
-All right, kids.
Hey, guys.
-Hi, Ru. How are you?
-Hi, Brittney.
-Hi!
-Now, Brittney, have you
ever been made over before?
-No, I have never, but I was
on tour with Miley Cyrus--
-Miley Cyrus?
-Yeah!
She thought of the outfits,
and she made everything.
<i>So we had cones</i>
<i>coming from our boobs,</i>
all crazy stuff.
-Wow.
Thorgy, do you have any sketches
or anything?
-Actually, I just--that was
the stage we just got to.
-Okay.
All right.
Time is running out.
-I'm feeling the pressure.
-All right, Thorgy.
-Thanks a lot, Ru.
-Thanks, Brittney.
-Thank you.
-Cool.
-Hello!
both: Hi.
-So what do you have planned?
-Well, we are the Tin Woman,
and the Tin "Whoa, Man!"
-[laughs]
-So I was thinking
of creating
elements that can
go onto a body suit
or something like that.
-That's great, but haven't
you done that before?
<i>Wearing a body suit</i>
<i>or a bathing suit,</i>
and then putting something
on top of it?
We're looking for couture,
something inspired
by the Tin Woodsman,
so take it from there.
-I don't handle
losing very well,
so I will give this 120.
-Well, you say that while
you have a hatchet in your hand.
That kind of scares me.
[laughter]
All right, well, I'm gonna
let you get to it.
-[sighs]
Now I have to rethink ideas.
That really scares me.
Oh, God.
-All right, ladies,
gather round.
Gather round, ladies.
Now tomorrow, in addition
to your runway presentation,
I want each duo to perform
a dreamy interpretive dance
set in a poppy field.
Of course.
[laughs]
Ladies, good luck,
and don't fuck it up.
-This challenge
just went from my dream
to my biggest nightmare.
[pretends to cry]
-This week's maxi-challenge
is makeovers
<i>for the cast of</i>
<i>"Little Women: LA."</i>
-They're looking like they're
getting creative over there.
-Which one?
Oh, the Tin Man?
-Mm-hmm.
-I wouldn't be too worried
about Derrick.
-All right, let's do it.
-Okay.
-We're sleeping.
-Are we gonna lay down?
-Yeah.
-This whole time?
-Yeah.
It's finally time to rehearse
our interpretive dance routine.
To ask the question "Do I
understand interpretive dance?"
is to ask "Do I know
the entire pi formula?"
And the answer is "No."
-I woke up with a nightmare.
His face looks like
he's going for a dental checkup.
-Oh, my God.
Terra, you belong here with us.
-[laughs]
-Pow!
-Girl, what the hell
are you doing?
Like, she's just slapping
her little lady around.
-Fucking bitch!
-You gonna get a charge, girl.
You beating up on a little lady.
-Oh!
-I'm guessing we should
just play up the fact
that we're scarecrows.
-Okay.
-And maybe we can, like,
do like a cross, like--
-Should I go in front of you?
-Sure.
-And then it looks like
you put that leg out.
-I don't know what to do.
What's interpretive dance?
-Uh...
-Uh oh.
The Scarecrow people.
-Are they practicing?
What they doing?
-No, they both staring
at each other,
trying to figure it out.
[laughter]
-He ain't no choreographer.
He don't dance.
He was in the bottom last week.
-Uh oh.
-This is his time
to, like, step it up.
-I have no idea what the fuck
we're supposed to do.
-"What do you think?"
"What do you think?"
"What do you think?"
-"What do you think?"
[both laugh]
-Y'all better stop
thinking and start doing.
[laughs]
-I love you.
[both laugh]
[machine stalling]
Why is this machine
being a dick?
[machine stalling]
Oh, my God.
Do you want to see
something completely insane?
-[gasps]
What the fuck?
Why did you sew
it like this?
I don't even know
how you did this.
-No, I don't either.
Isn't that bizarre?
Apparently this fabric
cannot be sewn on.
So we've gone from a
beautiful, regal cape,
to making bustles to give us
sort of a regal flair.
I want to scream.
My brain just exploded.
-[screams]
Oh, shit!
[laughter]
-Yes, indeed.
Our little hot glue skirt
turned out good.
-[laughs]
-I'm pretty much done.
I have a complete product
and I'm feeling good today.
-This working?
-Yes, ma'am.
It's not gathering?
-I'm right on track.
-Okay.
-Yeah, it's done.
-What?
We're all working,
<i>and she's done.</i>
<i>Do something more</i>
<i>to your outfit.</i>
Because it doesn't
look that great.
-Come on, Disco Dorothy.
-[laughs]
-I almost want to go over
there, like, "Hello?"
You have, like,
a challenge to do."
[hums]
<i>Somebody in this competition</i>
<i>should not be</i>
wasting their time but using
every single second
to create every
single thing perfect.
-Needless to say,
I was pissed off.
-Chi Chi is the next to go.
She's not ready
for this competition.
<i>[dramatic music]</i>
<i>[electronic dance music]</i>
-Let's do it!
-Oh, my goodness.
-Let's throw this hideous
purse away.
-I know.
-Did you just throw
Purse Purse?
How dare you?
-We're gonna have,
like, a fucking blast.
We just have to, like,
kill the runway.
Like, we have to kill it.
-Got it.
-Oh, Lord. Bob, how much do
you have to do still?
-Way too much.
-I thought you were
almost done yesterday.
-I was.
My outfit fell apart.
-He had to remake
a new outfit.
-[Bob] So I get to
the workroom this morning,
<i>and try on my couture look,</i>
and the zipper
just like flies off.
<i>It falls apart, basically.</i>
Like, it is just non-functional.
<i>So I need to make</i>
<i>a new outfit.</i>
And on top of that,
I still have to do my makeup,
<i>I have to do Elena's makeup.</i>
I'm like F-M-L.
Oh, my God.
This is madness.
-So do you kind of
find it hard
being a, you know,
a little person?
-It was hard.
-I am made fun of
all the time.
-I get personally offended
by the word "midget."
Because "midget" doesn't
necessarily mean,
like, a person.
-Mm-hmm.
-It just means something small.
It's such a derogatory,
ugly word.
It, like, makes me cringe
when I hear it.
-Do you think it's
because people are just
afraid of what
they don't know?
-Yeah.
-You know what trips me out?
Is if I'm literally
at the mall walking,
and somebody's like, "Oh,
my gosh! Look at that midget!"
I'm like, "Are you serious?"
-People have
a long way to come.
-Yeah.
-I think that's why I feel so
comfortable around gay people,
'cause they get how I feel
because, you know,
they get treated
the same way.
-Right, exactly.
You can't stop being the height
that you are, you know?
-Yeah.
-It's like who you are.
-And you love
who you love.
-Right.
At the end of the day,
everybody just
wants to be loved.
Everybody just wants to fit in.
-Exactly.
-My confidence
didn't really build
until I had a child.
-So you could be strong
for your baby.
-Yes, and I had to
help her deal with it.
-Mm-hmm.
-I had to be an example.
She's average height,
and so
I was really hard on her, 'cause
I had to gain that respect.
-Yeah.
-At an early age,
because I knew by the time
she was seven or eight,
she was gonna be
taller than me.
And I refused to be
on somebody's talk show
saying "My kid
is whooping my ass."
-Yeah. [laughs]
-That was not gonna happen.
<i>[electronic music]</i>
-There we go.
Oh, my God.
I don't know how I'm gonna
get any of this--
any of my shit done.
So Elena's done, but then
I look at myself in the mirror
and I'm like, "Oh, my God,
I don't have time
to get myself pretty."
-Okay, face.
Face, face, face.
I'm not wearing
any makeup at all.
-It's not possible.
It's literally not possible.
God damn it.
-Relax.
I don't know what
Bob is thinking.
We're all ready, so I don't
know how he's gonna throw it--
Well, I do know how he's gonna
throw his look together,
'cause that's just
what Bob does.
<i>But now he really has no look.</i>
The judges will finally
read him for something.
Please read Bob.
-Next time we hang out,
Elena,
it'll be under much less
stressful circumstances.
-I hope so.
-I don't know, girl.
I don't know.
Girl, this might be your time.
<i>-[laughs]</i>
<i>[car roars past]</i>
<i>-[laughs]</i>
<i>[car roars past]</i>
<i>[RuPaul's "Cover Girl" plays]</i>
<i>-And what?</i>
[cheers and applause]
Welcome to the main stage
of "RuPaul's Drag Race."
Michelle Visage.
-My darling,
there's no place like home.
-He's back!
Ross Matthews.
-I'm so excited, I'm clicking
my heels under the table, honey.
-[laughs]
And the world's
biggest "Oz" fan,
Todrick Hall.
-Ru, my life has been
black and white until now,
and now all I see
is amazing color.
-Oh, you gonna
play the race card?
[laughter]
And fashion's coolest designer,
and a supporter
of the drag arts,
Marc Jacobs is here.
-Can't be happier being
somewhere over
the rainbow with you.
-Thank you, darling. It's a joy
to have you here with us.
-Thank you.
-This week,
we challenged our queens
to drag up the cast
of "Little Women: LA."
And tonight, they're ready to
ease on down the runway.
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.
<i>[RuPaul's "The Realness" plays]</i>
-[RuPaul] First up,
serving Dorothy couture,
Chi Chi and Ti Ti DeVayne.
-Come on, Disco Dorothy.
<i>-[Chi Chi] We look good.</i>
<i>I mean, you can't go wrong</i>
<i>when you're serving up</i>
<i>Nubian Dorothy realness.</i>
-Come through, Dorothy.
-Zbornak?
-Zbornak, yes.
-[RuPaul] Serving Glinda the
Good Witch couture
is Bob The Drag Queen
and Rob The Faux Queen.
Glinda Evangelista!
[laughter]
<i>-[Bob] I'm really shocked that</i>
<i>I dressed as fast as I did,</i>
<i>but we look good.</i>
<i>Me and Rob The Faux Queen</i>
<i>are, like,</i>
<i>living our dreams</i>
<i>on the runway.</i>
-[Michelle] I think I wore
that outfit to prom.
-[Marc Jacobs] I think I wore
that outfit to prom.
[laughs]
-[RuPaul] Serving Scarecrow
couture,
Naomi Smalls and Jazzy Jems.
-I ain't scared of her.
-[laughs]
-Very Oz-mopolitan.
<i>-[Naomi Smalls] I'm trying to</i>
<i>give the judges a different</i>
<i>side of Naomi.</i>
<i>Vivienne Westwood</i>
<i>meets Scarecrow</i>
<i>meets Vidal Sassoon</i>
<i>and we look amazing.</i>
-[RuPaul] Thank God her pussy's
not on fire.
-[Michelle] We're all eating
crow now.
-We are.
-[RuPaul] Serving Tin Woodman
couture,
<i>Terra and Derrick Barry.</i>
-She brought her own lube!
-[laughs]
-I knew that I wanted to
make the Tin Woodman sexy,
<i>so we're showing leg,</i>
<i>we're showing body,</i>
-Ooh, girl, you better axe
somebody.
-[laughs]
-Not a girl,
not yet a tin woman.
[laughter]
-[RuPaul] Serving Cowardly Lion
couture,
Robbie and Hedda Turner.
Nobody mention Cecil.
-[laughs loudly]
<i>-[Robbie Turner] Rowr!</i>
<i>Christy and I,</i>
<i>we are giving you</i>
<i>king of the forest.</i>
<i>Serving courage and fearfulness</i>
<i>and elegance.</i>
-[RuPaul] This is the mane
event.
-[laughs]
-[Michelle] Paws up.
-[RuPaul] Serving Citizen of
Emerald City couture,
Thorgy Thor and Thorgeous.
I think it's 4:20
in the Emerald City.
[laughter]
-[Thorgy Thor] We're giving you
artistic Fifth Avenue
<i>meets "Fifth Element."</i>
<i>Everyone wants to be us and</i>
<i>everyone wants to know</i>
<i>where we purchased</i>
<i>these fabulous green outfits.</i>
-Always been seen
in emerald green.
-Oh!
Wow!
-[RuPaul] Serving Wicked Witch
couture, Kim Chi and Miso Chi.
You know, the Chi dynasty.
-[laughs]
<i>-[Kim Chi] My concept for this</i>
<i>runway is Isabella Blow</i>
<i>going to a funeral realness.</i>
<i>And Briana is definitely</i>
<i>selling the garment.</i>
<i>She's feeling all sorts</i>
<i>of fantasy.</i>
-Water won't melt them.
-[RuPaul] Now it's time for
"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz"
dream sequence.
<i>[RuPaul's "Night After Night"</i>
<i>plays]</i>
<i>[applause]</i>
-[RuPaul] Welcome, ladies.
It's time for
the judges' critiques.
First up, Chi Chi
and Ti Ti DeVayne.
-[Marc Jacobs] I thought your
performance was really sweet.
<i>And the two of you</i>
<i>look really pretty.</i>
But I would like to
see it all pushed further.
-I have something to ask you.
I know you're not
a breast drag queen.
Do you ever
consider contouring?
-Yes, I tried to kind of
contour tonight.
-With what,
translucent powder, girl?
[laughter]
Because your waist
is not cinched.
We gotta balance out the man.
-[RuPaul] Next up,
Bob The Drag Queen--
not to be confused
with Bob The Court Reporter--
and Rob The Faux Queen.
-Elena, do you feel gorgeous?
-Yeah. I feel like
I'm in "Hunger Games."
[laughter]
-Totally.
Well, I thought
you really shone tonight,
and, Bob, I don't think
that's good for you.
Elena looks inspired
by the Good Witch,
and yours, I feel like I could
get that in a mall.
-I guess I thought
that was the challenge.
I was really wanting
to make sure that Elena
felt like a beautiful goddess,
you know what I mean?
-But you're the one competing.
-Okay.
-Next up, Naomi Smalls
and Jazzy Jems.
-Everyone should take a look
at Naomi right now.
This is how you win
this competition.
-Yeah, you did
an amazing job.
I mean, it just gave me
Scarecrow
in the most gorgeous way.
The look, the details,
the makeup.
I just thought
it was perfection.
-And you could not have asked
for a better partner--Jasmine,
with these straw leg warmers on.
[laughter]
It was just phenomenal.
-Thank you.
-Next up, Derrick
and Terra Barry.
-It just looks so homemade,
in the worst way.
-Uh, I'm not a seamstress,
but I did sew everything
on here.
-It's a piece of fabric.
We're, like, pretty far in
to the competition now.
You have to give us more.
That is not
a Britney reference.
-I have watched you in Vegas.
I know what
you're capable of,
and it just sort of saddens me
because you're better than
what you just did up there.
-Next up, Robbie
and Hedda Turner.
-I literally don't even know
what to make
out of what you're wearing.
Bustles can be flattering
when they're on a big gown.
This looks like just a bunch
of ruched up fabric stuck--
And we have to work
on that hairline.
-I guess I'm a little
more old school.
I come from big ol'
Christian hair women.
-Even Jan Crouch
found a way to blend.
-[laughs]
-Robbie!
We're at this point now.
It's, like, so frustrating,
because you are so talented
and all we want is
for you to bring it.
And we're missing it.
-All right, Kim Chi
and Miso Chi.
-I got a Kimbra, Feller,
"Voluptuous Horror of
Karen Black" sort of vibe,
and the look was fantastic.
<i>-I loved the beginning</i>
<i>runway walk,</i>
even though it was
a little wobbly.
You had a complete concept.
Great job tonight.
-Next up, Thorgy Thor
and Thorgeous.
-What I was
charmed by, really,
was when you eased on down
the road into your dance moves.
-Your look tonight,
I thought it was cohesive,
but it didn't wow me.
I'm not gonna remember in a
few weeks, driving in traffic,
thinking "Oh, God,
remember that look?"
You know?
-Ladies,
one final question:
who deserves to click their
heels and go back to Kansas?
Starting with Chi Chi DeVayne.
-[blows out air]
I'm sorry, Derrick, but
your outfit to me, was just...
a train wreck.
-Bob The Drag Queen.
-Based off this challenge,
I would pick Derrick as well.
-Naomi.
-Based on execution, I would
probably say Derrick's too.
-Derrick.
-Well, I would say
all three that said me,
but I know I have
to pick one.
I would say Chi Chi's.
It's hot-glued together.
It's cut fabric
with no detail.
-What say you,
Robbie Turner?
-Chi Chi's didn't
scream "Dorothy" to me.
-Kim Chi?
-I love her,
but I'm going to say Chi Chi,
only because
yesterday, when everyone
was just working hard,
she was just sitting there,
and that was a time
that she could have
spent on her outfit.
Sorry.
-Thorgy Thor, you're up.
-Kim Chi, you literally said
every word that I was gonna say.
I think in this competition
you have to apply
every single second
and I'm here to win,
so people like
Chi Chi piss me off.
-Yes, I did have extra time,
because I did hot glue
my outfit,
but I did what was
in my range of doing.
But that's how they feel, so
I respect y'all's opinion.
-All right, I think we've
heard enough, ladies.
While you untuck backstage,
the judges and I
will deliberate.
Just between us
friends of Dorothy,
what do you think?
<i>Chi Chi DeVayne.</i>
-I really didn't care about
the hot glue gun conspiracy,
issue, whatever.
[laughter]
Like--
-Gluegate!
-You know, there's a lot of
hot glue gunning going on,
even at the Met Ball.
-Really?
-I don't want
to name names, but--
-Please name names!
-Please do!
-Who's mad at a hot glue gun?
<i>BenDeLaCreme won</i>
<i>a fashion challenge</i>
<i>with a hot glued dress.</i>
-But here's the deal:
that outfit, at this point,
is nowhere near good enough.
-Bob The Drag Queen.
-Well, Bob The Drag Queen
made the biggest mistake
<i>you can make in show business:</i>
<i>you don't let someone</i>
<i>outshine you!</i>
-But Elena looked beautiful,
so he did his job there.
-I know that that was part
of the challenge,
but I wasn't looking at
Bob The Drag Queen tonight.
I was looking at Elena.
<i>-[RuPaul] Naomi Smalls.</i>
-Told her last week
I was getting bored
of seeing her in underwear,
so when she came out tonight
the way she did with something
creative, it was amazing.
-The look, from head to toe,
was flawless.
<i>The choreography was amazing.</i>
-I could not have
been more proud,
and I don't even know her.
[laughter]
<i>-Derrick Barry.</i>
-I'm banging my head against
the wall with Derrick
because you're just giving
me a bathing suit
<i>with something wrapped</i>
<i>around your waist, again.</i>
And putting two horse penises
on your shoulders...
-Oh!
-[laughs]
-Doesn't change it.
-I cannot.
-She's amazing as Britney.
And we still haven't
gotten past this, episode six!
-I know that
Britney's frustrated.
-She seems lost to me.
-You said "Britney."
Did you say "Britney"?
-I sure did, yeah.
-That's hilarious.
-But that's the point.
<i>-Robbie Turn-ter.</i>
<i>-Yes, we've seen</i>
way better looks before.
even this hair thing done better
by Kim Chi in episode one,
but I just can't make myself
hate it.
I would be so angry to see
Robbie go home.
-But how many times
is he gonna be excused?
She is holding herself back.
You saw it in
the acting challenge
and you're seeing it again.
-Kim Chi.
-I loved the look,
but the performance
was a little out there.
Didn't understand
the laying of the brooms...
[laughter]
<i>The collecting of the brooms.</i>
But, you know--
-The trading of the brooms.
-The trading of the brooms.
Returning of the brooms.
[laughter]
-[RuPaul] Thorgy Thor.
-Believe it or not, kids,
this is scaled back
for Thorgy.
<i>She edited, 'cause</i>
<i>she was much plainer.</i>
-I wasn't getting
drag queen glamour.
<i>And the wigs I thought</i>
<i>were a St. Patrick's Day</i>
markdown sort of situation.
-I didn't hate the Grinch pubes
wig that she came out with.
[laughter]
I liked it.
-She wasn't the best of the
night, and she wasn't the worst.
I--
-Silence!
I have made my decision.
Bring back my girls...
and Toto too!
<i>Thorgy Thor.</i>
You're safe.
-Thank you.
[applause]
-Oh!
-Kim Chi.
<i>Your witch couture</i>
<i>slayed the house down.</i>
You're safe.
-Thank you.
-Naomi Smalls.
This week, you spun straw
into gold.
Condragulations, you are the
winner of this week's challenge.
[cheers and applause]
You and Jasmine have each won
$1,000 worth of spa services
from The Spa on Rodeo.
-Thank you.
-Awesome.
-[Naomi Smalls] It feels amazing
that the legendary RuPaul
is saying my name
in a positive way.
<i>I am freaking out.</i>
-Bob The Drag Queen.
Your Glinda was not bewitching.
You are safe.
-Yeah!
-Thank you.
Thank you.
[exhales]
-Derrick Barry.
<i>Your tin couture</i>
<i>was rusted.</i>
I'm sorry, my dear, but
you are up for elimination.
Robbie Turner.
This week you are
not queen of the forest.
Chi Chi DeVayne,
your Disco Dorothy
did not inspire oohs or ahhs.
Robbie Turner.
I'm sorry, my dear, but
you are up for elimination.
-I'm pissed off.
Like, this is so unfair.
-Chi Chi.
You are safe.
You may join the other girls.
-Thank y'all so much.
-Yes!
-I guess I was hoping
for a miracle.
<i>Like they were gonna</i>
<i>pluck Chi Chi</i>
<i>and put her back in the bottom</i>
<i>two where she belongs.</i>
Fuck.
-Two queens stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me
and save yourself
from elimination.
The time has come...
[thunder rumbles]
For you to lip-synch
for your life.
[voice echoes]
<i>-This is it--I'm gonna have</i>
<i>to take Robbie down.</i>
I love her,
but I will send her home.
-Good luck...
and don't fuck it up.
<i>-I feel confident.</i>
<i>I feel powerful.</i>
<i>I feel like I am killing</i>
<i>this performance.</i>
<i>-I'm nailing it.</i>
<i>Connect with my audience.</i>
<i>Make 'em laugh.</i>
<i>Make them want more.</i>
And then don't give it to them.
[cheering]
[laughter and applause]
-Whoo!
That's awesome!
-[sighs]
-Ladies, I've made my decision.
<i>[suspenseful music]</i>
Derrick Barry,
shantay, you stay.
-[exhales]
[sobbing]
I'm sorry.
This is the most emotional
roller coaster
I've ever been on.
I'm so outside
of my comfort zone here,
and it just crumbled down
on me today
because I had put myself
in a Britney box.
And I'm doing my best
to get out of that,
so thank you for allowing me
to continue to make it happen.
-Thank you.
-[sniffles]
May I leave the stage now?
[laughter]
-[inhales deeply]
Yes.
-Thank you all.
-Robbie Turner,
I'm reminded of a quote
from "The Wonderful Wizard
of Oz."
"Now I know I've got a heart
because it's breaking."
Now...
sashay away.
-Thank you, guys, so much.
Love you. Love you. Love you.
-Bye. We love you, Robbie.
-Love you. Mwah!
Good morning.
<i>-[Robbie Turner] Guess right</i>
<i>now I think still a little</i>
<i>stunned.</i>
<i>I'll probably get back</i>
<i>to Seattle and be like,</i>
"Woe is me,"
and eat some peaches
and then I'll be okay.
Oh, fuck.
-Top six!
Condragulations.
Remember, if you can't
love yourself,
how in the hell
you gonna love somebody else?
Can I get a "amen" up
in here, y'all?
all: Amen!
-All right.
Now let the music play.- Sashay away.
   Can I get an amen in here?
        Sashay away.
   Can I get an amen in here?
        Good luck.
        Sashay away.
   Can I get an amen in here?
    How the hell can you love
somebody else?
   Can I get an amen in here?
        And don't fuck it up.
        - Oh, my God.
            Hey.
        I am Peppermint,
    and I am sweet and sassy.
       Yes. I perform
    and host in New York.
                When you come
        to a Peppermint show,
   you're gonna see people
screaming and hollering,
     money flying and you're
     gonna feel special.
        I look great.
        Perfect.
            My braids
     are sitting just right.
    I got it going on.
               All right,
       let's get to work.
            - Hello.
       It's me, Valentina.
    (speaking Spanish)
      Who am I? Valentina.
        I'm 25 years old.
    I'm from Echo Park,
    California.
            Sass.
        Hey, beauty.
        - Valentina.
    I'm Peppermint.
    - (speaking Spanish)
             Mwah.
             - Mwah.
    My type of drag,
    it's very dramatic,
                very theatrical
        and always very Latina.
    I'm an undiscovered
        superstar.
    I've always dreamed
    of being in here,
    and here we are, girlfriend.
      - Here we are, girl.
    - Oh, come on, give it up
    for the big girl
    serving pure catfish.
    My name is Eureka,
    and I am 25 years old.
   People would categorize me
       as a pageant queen,
       but to me, my drag
    is the genre of fabulous.
                        (laughs)
         Hi, I'm Eureka.
    - Where are you from?
    - East Tennessee.
    Girl, I'm country
    as a biscuit, honey,
   and I love eating 'em, too.
                Your hair's hot.
    - Thank you, girl.
    - I love the baby hairs.
- I'm a little natural around
the way, girl, you know.
   - That's my favorite shape
            is round.
        - I can see.
         - I'll eat you.
        (all laugh)
        - Hi, hi, hi.
     It's about to get shady
           up in here.
    My name is Charlie Hides
    and I'm (muffled) years old.
        (door creaks)
            - Hey!
            - Hey!
    - Oh, my God,
    Peppermint's here.
   - I'm known as a celebrity
impersonator.
         My drag persona
         is rude, crude,
    socially unacceptable
    and over the top.
        Can I ask you,
        with that dress,
    why didn't you wear like
     a big pair of earrings?
- I really wanted to give you,
like, Walmart realness.
   - I'm getting that, Eureka.
   - Thank you.
        (all laugh)
   - It's Christina Aguilera.
        - So this is what
        it looks like.
        - She's naked.
    - My name is Farrah Moan,
    and I'm from
    Las Vegas, Nevada.
      - Oh, my God, dirty.
    - My drag is inspired
    by Vegas showgirls.
               My wardrobe
       shows a lot of skin
    and there's usually
    a feather or two
     or five dead ostriches.
     You never know with me.
    Hi.
    - Hi, I'm Charlie.
    - Charlie.
    - What's your name?
    - Farrah. Farrah Moan.
         - Farrah Moan walks in.
          She's a twig,
     and she looks about 12.
        I have underwear
         older than her.
        - Hi. I'm Eureka,
    like the vacuum cleaner.
        How are you?
    - I've never vacuumed
           before.
       - Well, I came
    to clean house, girl.
            - Aah!
             - What?
            - Aah!
                        (coughs)
        - Oh, wow.
   - My name is Sasha Velour.
    I am years 29 old.
    I am a bald, fashiony,
     artistic weird queen.
        Hi, ladies.
    I'm committed to being
    uniquely Sasha all the time.
    - Tell us about yourself.
    - I'm a visual artist.
     I love telling stories
     with art and with drag.
    - What story are you telling
with this unibrow?
        - (laughs)
     - How do you like them
     egg rolls, Mr. Charles?
      I'm Alexis Michelle,
    and I am New York City's
     premier Broadway queen.
        Oh, shit.
    I went to school
    for musical theater.
             I think
    the ultimate fantasy now
   would be to be on Broadway
            in drag.
    - Girl.
    - Come on, New York.
       - So the east coast
      is well represented.
       - I will say L.A.,
           west coast,
         it's the center
        of the universe.
                Sorry, New York.
        - She says forget
   what you heard, apparently.
        Memo taken.
    - My name is Shea Coulee,
   and I didn't come to play.
         I came to slay.
    - I love The Muppets.
    - I'm Shea Coulee,
    and I'm 27 years old.
       Shea Coulee is
    a champagne lifestyle
    on a lemonade budget.
            Hey!
    You're gonna get
    a full-on production
    when you see Shea Coulee.
        Costumes, check.
        Makeup, check.
    Dance moves, she got 'em.
    - Where are you from?
    - I'm from Chicago.
         - Yes, Chicago.
        (all laugh)
      - Chicago drag is the
   motherfucking bomb-dot-com.
        - Dot-com?
        - Yes, bitch.
        It's got its own domain.
        (all laugh)
    - The body is here, bitches.
        - Oh, shit.
   - Girl, I'm Trinity Taylor.
    Some people say I'm the look
          and feel of real,
        but my body
    speaks for itself.
         - Shut it down!
     - Trinity does not pad.
     I love plastic surgery,
    and I went from a pancake
        to a Kardashian.
     I do a lot of pageants,
     but I don't like to use
     the word pageant queen
      because there's such
a stigmatism with pageant queen.
    I can do anything,
         from beautiful
     to way outside the box.
       - Oh, my God. Lady!
    - Bitch, I'm just excited
        I know somebody.
       Me and Trinity know
   each other from competing.
   She, like, won the pageant
   that I really wanted to win
so, of course, there's that,
like, bougee attitude from her.
    - I am the body girl.
            I'm here
       and I'm not padded.
        - She's gonna be
        competition.
         - Who are
    the pageant girls?
    You're a pageant girl,
    I'm a pageant girl,
    you're a pageant girl.
    Just to clear the air,
    I promise I'm not
    one of the mean ones.
        (all laugh)
                - That is a lie.
             - Oh.
            - Ooh.
- There's always been tension
with me and Eureka.
    Maybe she has an issue
         with the fact
    that every pageant
    that we've been in,
        I beat her.
           - Is it me
      or is it hot in here?
         I'm Kimora Blac
         from Las Vegas.
    The queen is here.
    Bow down, bitches.
    - Oh, you ain't
    the only body, girl.
            - I love
      anything see-through
       and anything
    that shows my body.
    Big tits, big ass,
    irresistible.
    Gay guys love me,
    straight guys love me.
    Kimora Blac is everyone's
    sexual preference.
        - Hey, girl.
        - Oh, my God!
            Oh!
                Oh, my goodness.
    - That's my Vegas sister.
     Kimora's ass is famous.
    That's what she's
    gonna be known for.
    That ass is gonna have
    its own t-shirts.
    I can see it all now.
        - Season 9, baby.
         - How long
    you been doing drag?
         - Oh, my God,
        10 long years.
        - Bravo.
        - 10 long years.
        - 10 months.
    - And you can go to hell.
    - My debut was 10 months ago
when I performed.
    - I can't. I can't.
    I can't with her.
    - I'm fairly new to drag,
         but I wouldn't
         consider myself
         looking like
    an amateur drag queen.
    I carry myself like a winner
          and a superstar.
    - Come on, drag queen.
    - (laughs)
    - Hi, shape-shifters.
        - I am Jaymes Mansfield,
    I am 26 years old,
        and I'm from
    Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
                I build puppets.
    I'm a kooky, comedy queen
      that has way more
up her sleeve than they know.
        All right.
   - Jaymes Mansfield looks...
    scared and confused
    when she walks in.
               Like, am I
       in the right room?
    - Hi, honey.
    - Oh, my goodness.
        - These are my
        summer diamonds.
        Some are diamonds
        and some are not.
        (all laugh)
    - Is this all fake
    or is it real?
    - Um, I'd say the foot
    upward, it's all fake.
   - I meant your personality.
            - Ooh.
            - Ooh.
    - I'm Nina Bo'nina,
    banana fo-fana,
     Osama bin Laden, Brown,
     boom, boom, boom, boom.
        I am Nina Bo'nina Brown,
    and I am back in town
    to shut her down.
    Well, no, I can't say
    I'm back in town,
    'cause I haven't even
    been in town yet.
        - Yes, ma'am.
   - She seems a little mousy.
         - Hey, sisters.
            - Yay!
            - Yes.
          - My drag
    consists of fantasy.
               One minute
       I may be a zombie.
         The next time
         I may be a nun.
                I'm not cosplay.
    Nobody does what I do.
   - What inspired your look?
    - Well, you know, my drag
    is like universal, honey.
                You never know
        what you're gonna get.
   - So your drag's like STDs.
                You never know
        what you're gonna get.
        - Exactly.
            - Oh!
            - Oh!
        - My name is Aja and I'm
        from Brooklyn, New York.
           Your edges
    are officially snatched.
             - Yeah.
         - Aja is vangy.
    Her drag style is very
    the streets of Tokyo
        meets the streets
        of Brooklyn.
         She's cute,
    but she's dangerous.
     - Oh, my. I am so happy
           to see you.
         - I'm so happy.
         - I love Aja.
   She is the number one name
           in Brooklyn
             that people
    are talking about right now.
    - Hi. Aja. Mwah, mwah.
     Oh, you are so gorgeous
            in blue.
     - Thank you, thank you.
     So nice to meet you.
   Aja's makeup is just really
rough around the edges,
        but she comes off
        as confident.
        Does she know
    what she looks like?
    'Cause if not,
    I need to tell her.
    - I feel like I'm at home
    with so much talented girls.
            - Yes!
             - Oh!
            - Oh!
                        - Bitch!
      - Yes, ma'am, honey.
     - That's a damn good
     Lady Gaga impersonator.
        - Oh, girl.
        - Oh, my God.
      So this is the Derek Barry
            of the season.
            - Oh!
                - Yo, I'm Ronnie
        and I'm from New Jersey.
   I'm New Jersey's number one
   Lady Gaga impersonator.
    But what I'm really
    excited about
      is how long it takes
for these queens to figure out
that it's really me.
        - Is it time to go home?
        - (laughs)
                - Wait a minute.
          - The winner
     of "RuPaul's Drag Race"
   receives a one-year supply
          of Anastasia
     Beverly Hills cosmetics
        and a cash prize
        of $100,000.
        - Mother Monster
        has arrived.
                - Wait a second.
        (screaming)
    - Holy fucking balls,
    it's Lady Gaga.
       Like, the real one.
        - Holy shit.
   I'm on "RuPaul's Drag Race"
Season 9,
            and Lady Gaga
    is in the same room with me.
            Aah!
        (screaming)
        - Oh, my God.
        Oh, my God.
       - I can't tell you,
I have been the closest to death
         and you've
    pulled me out of it,
   and you don't even realize
   what you do for people
and how much you inspire people
like me and all of us.
    And I just want to tell you,
you're so amazing,
and I never thought in the world
I would ever meet you.
         And I think
    you're so incredible.
        I'm so sorry.
           I think
    you're so incredible.
            - Aw.
        (applause)
    - You allow us to be
    who we are as an artist.
        Thank you.
         - I have always
         really admired
   the craftsmanship that
   goes into what you all do.
    Drag has for me
    been an opportunity
           to leave myself
    when I didn't want to be me.
            - Right.
             - Yeah.
 - And felt so completely out of
place when I was in high school.
     Drag has just been part
of my life for the longest time.
    It's just really an honor
    for me to be here,
       to be with you all.
   - No, it's an honor for us.
   - Yes, Gaga.
    (cheers and applause)
        (door opens)
    - Hello, hello, hello!
    (cheers and applause)
        Oh, my Gaga!
        (all laugh)
    Gather round, ladies.
        Oh, darling, mwah, mwah.
        You look amazing.
     - Thank you, so do you.
       - Now you've had a chance
               to meet my girls.
     Do you have any advice
            for them?
                - You know, when
        you're having a bad day,
    just remember
    that I was nobody,
   and then I became somebody
            one day.
        And it's the same
        right here.
             - Ah!
            - Yes.
    - Your lives are gonna
     change forever today.
    And I would also
    remember something
    that you taught me
    a very long time ago.
    - Get the money up front?
     - Yes, and on the back.
        - (laughs)
    - Remember what
    he always has said:
       - Turn to the left.
       - Turn to the left.
             - Work.
             - Work.
        - Now turn to the right.
        - Now turn to the right.
             - Work
             - Work.
        - Sashay, shante.
    (cheers and applause)
    - Now, as you can see,
   this season is going to be
stuffed with more stars,
more stunts and more shenanigans
than ever before.
             - Yeah!
     - And on this premiere,
              for the first time
      in "Drag Race" herstory...
                        - Uh-oh.
        - No one...
        is going home.
            - Oh!
            - Oh!
    - (gasps) Crack, crack,
    crack, crack, crack, pow!
    Face on the floor.
        - #OhMyGaga.
    And ladies, to get
    this episode started,
    we're throwing a pageant.
            - Oh.
            - Oh.
    - Yes, Miss Thing,
the Miss Charisma, Uniqueness,
Nerve & Talent Pageant.
        (all laugh)
        - Yes!
        Oh, my God!
        I can do this.
    I want to show these bitches
                that I'm the one
                to look out for.
    - You'll be competing
    in two categories.
   First, you need to show us
        where you're from
          with a frock
   inspired by your home city.
    Second, as a salute to
    our legendary guest star,
    you need to strut your stuff
        in your favorite
         Lady Gaga drag.
    So don't be a drag,
    just be a queen.
    (cheers and applause)
          - Lady Gaga,
    would you do the honors?
       - Gentlemen,
    start your engines,
   and may the best woman win.
             - Whoo!
             - Yes!
        - Move, bitch.
        - Oh, my God, up.
        - Watch out now.
        - Ow!
     - I'm right behind you,
     honey. Sorry, guys.
    - Where am I gonna go?
    Where am I gonna go?
    - This first challenge
    is very important
    because this is the first
impression that you make.
No one can afford to fuck
      this shit up.
                - Bam, bam, bam.
    - Are they sure this
    wasn't the challenge,
    'cause I feel like
        I'm winded.
     - Is this already
     a claimed work station?
            Hello?
     Am I missing something?
       Can someone tell me
if there's another station
somewhere that I'm not seeing?
             (sighs)
           - Farrah
    is awkwardly endearing
        with the way
        that she whines.
           - So am I,
   like, Matilda or something?
       - I call her
    Blonde Benet Glamsy
    'cause she whines like
    a 6-year-old, so, huh.
    - I really want
    a station of my own.
     - So have you ever done
     a Gaga look before?
- Yeah, 'cause I've played her
 a bunch of times in my video.
   - Oh, yeah, in your videos.
   - I make YouTube videos,
    which I make by myself
    in my living room.
         I've been making fun of
 Lady Gaga on YouTube for years.
    I am always afraid that
    when I impersonate people
    that they're gonna watch
           my videos.
     Lana del Rey said I was
     an asshole, apparently.
                - Lana del Rey
        called you an asshole?
       - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Charlie has a very on the edge
kind of sense of humor.
     It's an acquired taste,
and I'm not sure if the judges
have acquired that taste.
- I'm wearing the rainbow kimono
that Gaga wore.
        - Yes, bitch.
        - Coming through.
    - It's V collar.
    Oh, like it's the one.
        I was like, can I, like,
        go through your archives
    and, like, have stuff?
     And he was like, yeah,
     take whatever you want.
     - Aja is very New York.
    "I'm from New York.
       I did this."
          "Oh, my God,
     this guy made me this."
   She talks about the costume
designers and all this jazz.
        No one cares.
   - Touch it. It's arctic fox
       dyed with saffron.
    - Oh. My hometown look
    is a Georgia peach.
Girl, I said, how am I gonna go
from a damn mouse to a peach?
        I haven't seen
        a lot of girls
    who can get some paper
     and some kind of glue
    and create a new face.
         I may not have
         the best stuff,
   but I work with what I got,
    and I think that's
    what makes me different.
    I just need for people
    to believe in me.
- Ladies, who wants to win
the first challenge the most?
            - Me!
            - Me!
        - Come on, girl!
        - Everybody.
      - Get in line, girl!
    - I'm about to storm
    all you bitches.
    - Right. She gonna be
    just like the candy.
    She gonna dissolve.
          Ha ha!
    - The stakes are high
    for this first challenge
    because everyone is fighting
         for that spotlight.
      - The true Gaga-rini,
that is what's about to go down.
     - I feel very prepared
           and ready.
   The only thing that I want
   from this challenge
       is to beat Trinity.
    - Coming up....
    - She (bleep) nailed it.
    - You could put Donald Trump
           in that dress,
    he's gonna look gorgeous.
   - That I don't agree with.
           (all laugh)
   (RuPaul laughs, bell dings)
        (applause)
                        - Hello.
               Welcome to
       the Miss Charisma,
        Uniqueness, Nerve
        & Talent Pageant.
    Let's meet our distinguished
panel of judges.
    Fourth runner-up in the Miss
South Plainfield New Jersey
   Popping, Dipping, Spinning
   and Vogue-ing Pageant,
        Michelle Visage is here.
    - Darling, I wear it
    with pride. Thank you.
    - Style superstar,
    Carson Kressley.
     - I love that this is
    a scholarship pageant.
        Great work.
    - And the hilarious
    Ross Mathews.
        - I have Vaseline
        on my teeth.
                        - Ha ha!
    - And the one,
    the only Lady Gaga.
    - Well, if you could
        do me a favor
   and shoot me from the left
        and put a filter
   on that camera, would you?
   - All right, Ms. Streisand.
         Now, to get
    to know them better,
         our contestants
    will introduce themselves
wearing frocks that represent
their home cities.
    Let the pageant begin.
        (applause)
        Category is...
    First up, Peppermint.
        - Check out
        those big apples.
     - My name is Peppermint
     from New York City,
      home of Metro cards,
   EBT cards and Lady Liberty.
        - That's a mint
    I'd like to bite into.
        - Valentina.
                - Ole, you stay.
                - I'm Valentina.
       I'm from East L.A.
         and I'm repping
         Mariachi Plaza.
                - Oh, Mary-achi.
                Next up, Eureka.
    She's the forgotten
    Mandrell sister.
                        - Right.
         - Howdy, y'all.
           I'm Eureka
    and this is Mary Jo Beth.
        I come to you
    from East Tennessee,
    and I'm representing
    the redneck woman.
        (all laugh)
   - Honky-tonk ba-donka-donk.
        Charlie Hides.
Honey, she is Thanks-giving it
       to you, darling.
            - She is.
    - Hi. I'm Charlie
    from Massachusetts,
    the home of the pilgrims,
America's first drag queens.
                - She's a witch.
    - Burn her!
    - Burn her at the stake!
     - Up next, Farrah Moan.
   - I can tell from here
   she gives great head-dress.
    - Hi, my name's Farrah Moan.
   I'm from Las Vegas, Nevada.
    Are you feeling lucky?
        - What happens in Vegas
                slays in Vegas.
         - That's right.
         - Yeah.
        - Next up, Sasha Velour.
         She's crowning.
        (all laugh)
   - Hi, I'm Sasha Velour
   and I'm from New York City,
    home of queer modern art,
Haring, Warhol, Basquiat.
    - Burger Queen.
    She's got a Whopper.
    We just can't see it.
    - Alexis Michelle.
    - These have always
    brought me luck.
    - I'm Alexis Michelle,
    a native New Yorker,
        home of Broadway, bagels
                and an epicenter
                of civil rights.
   - Work that message, girl.
     - Darn kids have tagged
     my swimsuit again.
   - See, it's the elder care
        that I relate to.
        - Shea Coulee.
      - She-brew national.
- Don't be fooled by the brats
that she got.
- My name's Shea Coulee
and, bitch, I'm from Chicago!
        (all laugh)
   Nothing reminds me of home
     more than a big wiener
 sandwiched in between two buns.
        - The other girls
       better "catch up."
    They "must-heard" about her.
           I want you
    to "relish" this moment.
        (all laugh)
        Somebody stop me.
        - (laughs)
         Trinity Taylor.
    - You must be this tall, Ru,
         to take that ride.
    - I'm Trinity Taylor
    from Orlando, Florida,
    the theme park capital
         of the world.
      Want to take a ride?
    - I'd take a ride
    on her disco trick.
        - Uh-huh.
        Kimora Blac.
   - Blac lives matter, y'all.
- Hello, my name is Kimora Blac
from the city of Las Vegas.
    All the girls in Vegas
         just know me
    as the youngest, hottest,
skinniest queen.
    And if you're feeling
    a little frisky,
    whatever you do to me
    stays in Vegas.
- This message has been brought
to you by penicillin.
        (all laugh)
   Up next, Jaymes Mansfield.
        - Holy cow!
   - Hi, I'm Jaymes Mansfield.
    I'm a<i> tejano</i> living
    in Milwaukee, Wisconsin,
      land of beer, cheese
       and serial killers.
            Shh.
        (all chuckle)
    - She's a dairy queen.
            - Aja.
    - Make America gay again.
    - Yes.
    - My name is Aja
    and I'm from New York,
where people are always angry
       on the streets.
    But it's okay 'cause
    you could be yourself.
        Lady Liberty has spoken.
- I wonder how many immigrants
have gone through her.
        (all laugh)
       Nina Bo'nina Brown.
        She's got Georgia
        on her mind.
         - And her face.
- I am Nina Bo'nina banana
fo-nana Osama bin Laden Brown.
         Originally from
         South Kakalaki,
      you can now catch me
      in Atlanta, Georgia.
   Take a bite of this peach.
    - It looks like she's got
    a touch of the Zika.
    - (laughs)
    - Oh, my, Michelle.
The last thing I thought would
be brought up today is Zika.
        - Coming up...
    Our contestants
    return to the stage
        wearing their very best
                Lady Gaga drag.
    - Do I have something
         on my face?
        (all laugh)
   (RuPaul laughs, bell dings)
         (RuPaul laughs)
       - Welcome back
    to the Miss Charisma,
        Uniqueness, Nerve
        & Talent Pageant.
        (applause)
    In this next category,
    our contestants
    return to the stage
        wearing their very best
                Lady Gaga drag.
    First up, Peppermint.
       Grammy Awards 2016.
    - If it ain't brocade,
         don't fix it.
         - Crowd control
         to Major Tom,
      giving you Gaga/Bowie
            realness.
             Because
    the entire point of drag
    is to give the middle finger
         to rules of gender.
        - I have nothing to say.
   I'm going to be speechless
        this whole time.
        - Wham, bam,
        thank you, ma'am.
    Next up, Valentina,
    the CFDA Awards.
    - That was Mugler when
    Nicola Formicetti was there.
- I am wearing the look
she wore for the CFDA Awards.
     I definitely see myself
     a bit in Lady Gaga
   because she carries herself
   with grace and glamour,
    but I always want to add
    a Latina flair to what I do.
    - I brought my sister
         as my date,
        and we were both
        on the red carpet
   like a bunch of pissed off
          New Yorkers.
   - Some things never change,
darling.
    - Paparazzi love her.
    Next up, Eureka,
    the "Telephone" video.
            - Yes.
      - Guilty as charged.
    I decided to do
    the "Telephone" look.
    I just want to give them
something big and glamorous
   and kind of risky couture.
   Got my titties on my chin,
    cinch, pull and tuck, honey,
that's the D.
        - Great choice, darling.
       I believe that was
      Jean de Castelbajac.
    who made that garment.
    - Oh, you say that
    to all the queens.
       - Next up, Charlie Hides,
               Brit Awards 2010.
   - That's a lace front wig,
           I believe.
    - I believe it is.
    - Yes.
      - I've chosen to wear
           the outfit
    that Lady Gaga wore
    for the 2010 Brit Awards.
    I've done Lady Gaga hundreds
        of times on YouTube,
and I think I'm pretty polished,
so I'm fairly confident.
        - Philip Treacy
    made this for McQueen,
and he gave it to me because
I was doing a tribute to him.
    - Don't be a drag,
    be a McQueen.
     Next up, Farrah Moan,
    the "Alejandro" video.
                - Pray and slay.
    - Oh, my God,
    look at her cross.
      - I look exactly like
            Lady Gaga
        in my "Alejandro"
        music video look,
    and I'm rocking my real hair
     and I really hope that
     Lady Gaga lives for it.
    - That attitude and the face
           is really good,
   and the makeup is on point
   because Steven Klein and I
    had an argument about it.
I thought it was too much makeup
in this scene.
    - Don't cross this queen.
      - Everybody needs a virgin
             to sacrifice.
      - Can I get an amen?
    Next up, Sasha Velour,
     the "Applause" video.
    - Do I have something
         on my face?
        (all laugh)
        - I'm wearing
        my favorite look
     that she has ever done.
   A Pierrot clown, high art,
   Pat McGrath makeup.
                It is the place
        where art and pop meet.
 - It's gonna be hard for this
not to be one of my favorites.
     - What do you live for,
              Gaga?
         - The applause.
        (all laugh)
     - Painted for the Gaga.
        (all laugh)
    - Alexis Michelle,
    the Golden Globes.
    Best actress realness.
      - When I saw Gaga at
 the Golden Globes in this gown,
     I said she's wearing
     Alexis Michelle's body.
    So here I am body, curve,
    swerve and trophies.
            - Yay!
    - Donatella Versace
    made this for me.
       That is not easy to
   make that bodice that way.
     Wonderful job, darling,
      and thank you for bringing
              my Globe with you.
        - It's Ver-sayce.
    - Matching trophy.
    - Shea Coulee,
    Monster Ball Tour.
        Paws up, baby.
    - My Lady Gaga look,
    it's ethereal, powerful,
    yet gentle and serene,
    and it mixes engineering
          and fashion.
- This reminds me of the film
that Nick Knight did
    with the yellow electric
          urine blonde.
            - Mmm.
- Urine blonde is my screen name
on Scruff.
            - It is?
            - Yes.
    - It's my password
        on Netflix.
        - Trinity Taylor,
 "American Horror Story, Hotel."
        - Yes, Countess.
        - Yes.
        - This look speaks to me
    because I love darkness
    and glamour and vampires.
            And Lady Gaga
      was so seductive and sexy
   and brilliant in the show.
- Trinity, a little club soda
will take that right out.
    - You know, they say that
    if you use your own spit,
           the enzymes
   break down the blood, so...
         - Good to know.
         - Thank you.
    - This competition
    is cutthroat.
         Kimora Blac,
    Lady Gaga "On The Go."
    - This is the Versace phase.
- I'm giving a look that Gaga
wears to, like, the airport.
   I think picking out what
   she's done for red carpets
        is so predictable
    and it's so, like,
    all right, done.
- Those boots, they remind me
       of the pleasers
    that I used to get
    off of, um...
    - Hollywood Boulevard,
            honey.
        - Yep, yep.
       - No ifs, ands
       or butts about it.
        - Uh-uh.
        - No, ma'am.
    - Jaymes Mansfield,
    the cover of "Vogue."
            - Oh.
     - I am serving you Gaga
    on the cover of "Vogue."
        My drag is campy
        and different,
     so I'm giving you Lady Gaga
          in slumber land.
         I look amazing.
    If they don't like
    this dress,
    don't blame me,
    blame Marc Jacobs.
    - Oh, she's a little sleepy.
       - It's Marc Jacobs.
       She's Marco-leptic.
   - She's actually not wrong,
either,
        because I was so tired
the day that we did that shoot
that that's probably what
I looked like in between shots.
      - Cover girl, put some gel
             in your hair.
    Nina Bo'nina Brown,
        VMAs 2009.
        - Oh, my God.
      - Yes, McQueen, yes.
- This was one of the biggest
nights of my life.
        - I'm serving you
 the black version of Lady Gaga.
    Lot of hips, a lot of ass
       and a lot of sass.
    I can't see how Lady Gaga
           is reacting
    because I can't see anybody.
    - I just love the expression
             in her face
   when she wears this outfit.
    You know, you can tell
         she's happy.
   - Oh, no, she's on the edge
           of whore-y.
       Up next, Aja,
    Commes des Garcons.
    - Now, where did I
    park my car?
        - For my Lady Gaga look,
   I'm wearing a remake of her
Commes des Garcons look
    that she wore to show
    that beauty has no shape.
- Now, I wore this because
the media was saying I was fat
   and I knew this archive,
so I called Commes des Garcons
    and I asked him
    if we could wear it.
          It's such
    an excellent choice.
      - And very slimming.
   - It's all about the waist.
        <i> - Oy, gevalt.</i>
        (all laugh)
        - Coming up...
        Wait a minute.
     Stop the music, please.
     The real competition
     is just about to begin.
        - Fuck. Oh!
   (RuPaul laughs, bell dings)
         (RuPaul laughs)
       - Okay, judges,
we are looking for one winner
    who has what it takes.
    Let's start with Peppermint.
    - I think Peppermint
    has a fun personality.
You could tell that she likes
to take the piss with her drag,
       and I do like that.
   I thought her Lady Liberty
   was kind of basic to me.
    Peppermint's David Bowie,
   it would have been so great
   to have the lightning bolt.
    - On the face, yeah.
    - Yeah.
       - I love when I see
      the exact impression
     and the detail in that,
       but the adding
    of the hoop earrings,
     I didn't understand it.
       Bowie wouldn't have
       worn them that big.
           If he did,
      he would've worn one.
         - One, exactly.
           - You know,
    so I'm looking at detail.
        - Valentina.
    - That hometown look of hers
    was my very favorite look
    of anybody up there.
               It was just
       such a strong look,
       and her Spanish sombrero,
               East L.A. homage,
   I thought it was super fun.
     I thought she was beautiful
          and I thought
    the makeup was on point.
    And then, the Lady Gaga look
       was also super strong.
    - Both of these looks
    brought a tear to my eye.
     Her walk was fantastic.
             For me,
     she was the best model.
            - Mm-hmm.
            - Wow.
    - Eureka, that first outfit,
    there was a little bit of
    a used-up Tina Turner there.
       - Tina Turner away.
- I was laughing and entertained
and that's part of this.
        As far as her Gaga look,
    I thought it was fun,
    it was detailed.
   - She's actually one of
   my favorites of the night.
                - Charlie Hides.
        Her first look
        was the pilgrim.
    - I wasn't blown away
    by the first look.
      I felt like there was
supposed to be a rip-away moment
     and it kind of just
sort of got a little mangled.
    But the Gaga look might have
been one of my favorites.
    - The detail of the way that
that lace sort of interlays,
    it's beautifully done.
        - Farrah Moan.
   - That first outfit was
definitely not Las Vegas.
     I felt it was more like
     a different version
   of, like, "Anna Karenina,"
            you know.
        - "Anna Karenina"
   goes to "Game of Thrones."
        - Well, she does
        sort of look like
   she's in the main showroom
         of the Vatican.
        - Yes.
        - (laughs)
   - As far as her Gaga look,
   being a smaller queen,
    she chose something
    that swallowed her up,
and that might not have been
the best idea for a Gaga look.
    - I was hoping that there
   was going to be tear-away.
    - Yes.
    - And there wasn't.
      I do have to say
I was impressed by her poise.
       - I'm wearing Poise
      right now, actually.
        Sasha Velour.
     - One too many props
     can spoil a good party.
    She was kind of cumbersomely
standing up there
    holding these things.
   - Hey, Michelle, it's only
episode one of season nine,
    and I'm already
    disagreeing with you.
             - Okay.
             - Okay?
    - Go on.
    - I like more is more.
     I like that she brought
           the props.
    She didn't waste any time
showing us who she is.
        - Too much.
    - If you just lose
    the portrait,
    this would've been
    a perfect performance.
- Look at Gaga finding middle
ground for Michelle and I.
     - And then, "Applause,"
     I thought she did well
           and even in
    that kind of flowy thing,
     it changed her persona.
     - Yes.
    - Yeah, I didn't know
         who it was.
    - Right.
    - And that is great drag.
             - Yeah.
         - I don't think
         any other queen
   told us exactly who she is
   better than she did.
    - Alexis Michelle.
- When you're gonna use things
like words on your body,
    you have to be able
    to read them.
            - Mm-hmm.
   - And the way they were
positioned on the bustier
     and on the corset,
     you couldn't read them.
       The point was lost.
    But her Gaga moment
    was stunning.
    - Yeah.
    - That dress is amazing.
      You could put Donald Trump
            in that dress,
    he's gonna look gorgeous.
    - No.
    - That I don't agree.
    The shape and the silhouette
that she achieved,
    this was really good.
    - Mm-hmm.
   - This is someone to watch,
            I think.
        - Shea Coulee.
    What'd you think about
    that first outfit?
- I thought that was really fun
and very memorable.
    I mean, who doesn't like
    a giant wiener on your head?
   - As long at it's girth-y.
         - And I thought
    the Gaga look was great.
        - That dress
        is just amazing.
- The dress was actually made
       by Jim Henson.
    - Of "The Muppets?"
    - Yes. The original dress
was made in very particularly
pleated origami,
    and it was mechanical.
                And I felt that
        some of the other girls
    went a little further
    with the detail.
    - Let's talk Trinity Taylor,
    no relation to Rip Taylor.
        - Oh, damn it!
        - Yeah.
    - I thought Trinity's
    Orlando outfit
        was kind of nondescript.
    You wouldn't know
    where she was from.
    Now, when she turned around,
    it was the kind of anal sun.
             - Yeah.
   - And it was kind of like,
            oh, okay.
      But her Countess Lady Gaga
             drag I loved.
        - Phenomenal.
       - I loved it
    from top to bottom,
    and everybody knows
    I love a bottom.
        - That hair that she did
                for the Countess
    is so difficult to do.
        To get that type
        of smoothness
   and to get the lace to lay
   that flat is very hard.
    She fucking nailed it.
         - Let's move on
         to Kimora Blac.
- I thought the first look was
not indicative of Vegas to me.
   It was very cheap looking.
    And the Gaga look, to me,
it just seemed like something
you'd see in a bar.
       There's no pizzazz.
    - I think she needs a moment
         to get comfortable.
       - Jaymes Mansfield.
        - I love whimsy.
        - Yeah?
- I thought I was being served
        a comedy queen.
    I was left with a little
    drag blue balls with her.
   I didn't get what I thought
       I was going to get.
     - Well, there's so much
         you could get.
    If you're from Milwaukee,
    I mean, you could be
    covered in cheese.
    You could have a wig
    that looks like an udder.
   Like, you can't go halfway.
    - Right. Like, take it
    to the next level.
        - Milk it.
        You milk it.
     - Milk it, honey, yeah.
    - What did you think
    of her interpretation
    of your "Vogue" cover?
        - The hair
    is not what it was.
         My bigger issue
    is I think she's hiding.
     It's about her just letting
    her true self shine through.
    - All right. Let's talk
    about Nina Bo'nina Brown.
    - I was so excited
    when she walked around
          the corner.
     - It's whimsical,
     but it's also fabulous.
    - That insane peach face
         with the head.
        It's so twisted,
   and yet it's so beautiful.
         And this choice
         of the McQueen,
    she makes a statement
    with each piece.
            - She has
     a point of view, yeah.
      - She has a point of view
            as an artist.
        I see a star.
     - Let's move on to Aja.
      - I wasn't blown away
by the Statue of Liberty moment.
        It's okay.
   - Why do you hate America,
Carson?
        (all laugh)
            - I did love
    the Commes des Garcons look,
    but the makeup was real bad.
         - I don't know
   that she nailed it tonight,
         but this girl,
she's gonna keep surprising you.
   - All right. Judges, time
   to fill out your scorecards
        and bring back my girls.
    - The Florida
    election committee
        will be verifying
        these results.
        - (laughs)
   (RuPaul laughs, bell dings)
         (RuPaul laughs)
         - Welcome back.
    I've combined
    the judges' scores,
      divided them by five
      and added a 20% tip.
        - (laughs)
    - When I call your name,
    please step forward.
             Eureka.
             - Ooh.
         - Sasha Velour.
       Nina Bo'nina Brown.
        - (gasps) Oh.
    - I wish you could see
    the expression on your face.
        - (laughs)
        - I wish I could see
    the expression on your face.
   Con-drag-ulations, ladies.
             You are
    our top three finalists.
    Now, if for any reason
        tonight's winner
   cannot complete her reign,
the first and second runner-ups
will thumb wrestle
              to determine
      who takes her place.
        (all laugh)
        I hold in my hand
   the name of Miss Charisma,
Uniqueness, Nerve & Talent.
Ladies and gentlemen, the winner
 of a fabulous week-long getaway
    to The Grand Resort and Spa,
   Fort Lauderdale's premiere
   gay men's spa resort...
            (inhales)
And the title of Miss Charisma,
Uniqueness, Nerve & Talent...
                The winner is...
       Nina Bo'nina Brown.
        - Yes!
        (applause)
                - Come on, mama.
     - For them to crown me,
     it means a lot to me.
         Girl, Lady Gaga
         bought my drag.
        She bought it.
    She didn't rent it
     from the Netflix.
        She bought it.
      Validation complete.
    - Is there anything
    you'd like to say?
          - I know that
   this is just the beginning,
but to get you guys' approval
for this means a lot to me.
        Thank y'all
        so much for this.
    I truly appreciate it
    from my heart.
- Well, my queen, go ahead
and serve your public, honey.
    - Yeah. Come on, baby.
            - Yes.
   - Congratulations, darling.
    - Nina Bo'nina Brown.
    Oh, wait a minute.
    Wait a minute.
     Stop the music, please.
    Ladies and gentlemen,
    I have to apologize.
   This is not a Steve Harvey
moment.
       Nina, you are still
               our winner.
      You are still our winner,
            honey, but...
     The real competition
     is just about to begin.
           I'm introducing
     a 14th queen into the race.
            - (gasps)
            - What?
            - Who?
        - Fuck. Oh!
        - Breathe.
    - Please welcome back
       to the race...
       The 14th contestant
        in the 9th season
    of "RuPaul's Drag Race."
            (screams)
            - Yeah!
                        - Bitch!
     Ru, are you punking us?
        - Oh, my God.
        - No fucking way.
            What?


         - Aw, Jaymes.
           - Oh, no,
  the first lipstick message.
        - I mean, Jaymes
       was very insecure,
    and she just wasn't sure
          of herself.
        And this is such
  a high pressure competition,
      you have to be sure
          of yourself.
          - You know,
   the second she walked in,
  I saw the fear in the eyes.
       And I just saw her
         get defeated.
    - I honestly was really
 surprised I was on the bottom.
             Like,
    I was really surprised.
   I'm feeling so underdogged
  because compared to Jaymes,
   I was like a 10 to a one.
  - How about you, Ms. Winner?
      How are you feeling?
           (cheering)
    - I think you admittedly
    have the least amount of
  experience of all the queens
        and you slayed.
      - I'm very grateful,
  but it's a lot of pressure.
      So I'm very focused
  to deliver to the next level
       every single time.
  - I'm really looking forward
      to knocking you out
   of your winner spot, okay?
          (all laugh)
        - Yes, she's won
     a challenge. Whatever.
         Her confidence
      is definitely ballsy
    for her only doing drag
         for 10 months.
            - Whoo!
       - Is the bride sad
 to take off her wedding dress?
         - I really am.
 - I'm not mad at you for that.
         I understand.
  - I've been praying so hard
   to<i> La Virgen de Guadalupe</i>
   and I feel like she's been
     guiding me through it.
         - It's not fun
     being the bridesmaid.
    I want to be the bride.
  I'm not here to play games.
  The next challenge is mine.
          - The winner
    of "RuPaul's Drag Race"
   receives a one-year supply
   of Anastasia Beverly Hills
           cosmetics
        and a cash prize
          of $100,000.
       With extra special
          guest judges
          Todrick Hall
     and Cheyenne Jackson.
     - Here were are again.
         - It's today.
         - It's today.
          (all laugh)
    I'm coming off this high
         of having won.
 The first queen has gone home,
      and it feels great.
        It feels exactly
    like I thought it would.
    Okay, guys, after, like,
    the gymnastic challenge,
        what to expect?
        - I'm still sore
       from cheerleading.
            - Girl.
        - So I'm hoping
  it's not anything physical.
    - A knitting challenge.
          (all laugh)
            (siren)
         - Whoo, girl!
     She done already done
          had herses.
   - Oh, my God, oh, my God,
          oh, my God.
     - To become America's
      next drag superstar,
       you have to try on
    a lot of glass slippers,
     kiss a bunch of frogs,
  but don't be an evil queen.
           That role
    has already been taken.
          (evil laugh)
      Hello, hello, hello.
     (cheers and applause)
          - Hello, Ru.
         - Yes, ma'am.
        - Just a little
         leopard print.
          - Now, what
       do you guys think
    of the wax figure of me
 on loan from Madame Tussauds?
          - Gorgeous.
        - I pray to her
      before a challenge.
           - Really?
            - Yeah.
        - Don't you love
        the way her eyes
  follow you around the room?
    It's almost like there's
   a hidden camera in there.
           - (gasps)
  - Watching your every move.
        Maybe there is.
             - Oh!
    - Ladies, don't let this
 devastatingly beautiful queen
       cast an evil spell
       on your charisma,
 uniqueness, nerve and talent.
    Because for this week's
        maxi challenge,
  you need to create a totally
  original fairytale princess.
      - I have no problem
        picturing myself
         as a princess.
        I'm a jappy girl
     who likes nice things.
    - First, you'll come up
     with a memorable name
        and a mythology.
   Then you'll need to design
        a fantasy frock
  to debut on the main stage.
         #DragPrincess
     And to help you bring
  your princess story to life,
    you'll also be creating
       a sassy sidekick.
            - Rawr.
    - And you'll be playing
          both parts.
     - What? We have create
       a little sidekick
       to have our heads
   floating by our character.
         This is nuts.
      Who thinks of this?
 - So, Cinderfellas, feel free
  to use the magical materials
  from the Fabric Planet wall.
 Gentlemen, start your engines
  and may the best woman win.
     (cheers and applause)
            - Whoo!
   - Ooh. How are you feeling
  about this challenge, girl?
      - I feel like I have
      the new age mindset
   to kind of like make this
     extremely avant-garde
       and high fashion.
           - Mm-hmm.
    - So I feel like I might
   have this one in the bag.
    It's a design challenge,
        and I sew 80%--
 no, 95% of everything I wear,
        so I'm known for
   creating different looks,
  and I feel really confident
that this might be my challenge.
        - What the fuck
          am I doing?
         I do not sew.
    I've only made tote bags
          and pillows.
              No.
        - Are you okay?
      - I'm gonna just try
 and make something mermaid-y,
    something under-watery.
          - I'm doing
     under the water, too.
    - Are you doing a fish?
  - I was gonna do a mermaid,
  but then, like, I was like,
    there's too many people
  doing under the water stuff.
            - Great.
            - Yeah.
           I don't--
      Yeah, I'm terrified.
       - Ooh. What's this
   that you got here, Kimora?
 - I'm going to be, obviously,
      Tarzan's other wife.
  - How are you feeling about
   going into this challenge?
   You were in the bottom two
           last week.
      - And you don't sew.
           - I know.
          I don't sew.
    I like to pay designers
       to make my stuff.
     I'm your very spoiled
          drag queen.
          Would Kim K.
    sew her own outfits? No.
  - Well, if you pay designers
       to do your stuff,
    how much will you pay me
    to make your challenge?
           - I mean,
     I have $400 right now.
           - I'll see
      if I have some time.
         - I don't work
        in a sweatshop.
           That's not
     what I signed up for.
     This is not America's
      Next Top Sweatshop.
  - Where you gonna put this?
    Like, on your shoulder?
      - I just got the rat
           for show.
        - Just because.
 - I don't even really want it.
        - Can I have it?
     - Yeah, take it, girl.
          - Thank you.
  I think with this challenge,
      I'm wanting to show
      that I'm not afraid
  to go in a risky direction.
      - What is all these
       cockroaches, girl?
     - That's for my look.
     - What are you doing?
         - Like, sewer
     underground princess.
       Like, very grungy
       and gross kind of.
 Have, like, some kind of shit
     growing off of my face
   and, like, very sewer rat.
      - I have never heard
      of a sewage princess
       in my entire life.
     What kind of princess
            is that?
          Here we go.
   Better watch out, because
 the judges don't play around.
       She could go home.
    - Thank you for the rat.
       - You're welcome.
     - Come on, Templeton.
             - Aah!
         - Coming up...
      You came very close
     to winning last week.
     - Ms. Thang, she won.
     She better watch out.
        Fuck that bitch!
  (RuPaul laughs, bell dings)
        (RuPaul laughs)
      - What's the story?
     - Once upon a time....
          - There was
     a beautiful princess.
     - For this challenge,
       we have to create
  a fantasy fairytale princess
     and a sassy sidekick.
      Oh, my God, Trinity,
      you've never looked
         more beautiful
     than you do right now.
       - You're a bitch.
      You're such a bitch.
           - (laughs)
  - So what are you going for?
    You're going for, like,
         sea princess?
           - My whole
       Instagram branding
   is based on the fact that
  I ride the subway to my gig.
          - Okay, yes.
 - So I'm Princess Subway Fish.
   - We were given the brief
        to come up with
a mythological background story
      for our princesses.
         - Introducing
       Princess Forella.
           - Someday,
     she'll be the most...
      What's an adjective?
     What is an adjective?
       Isn't an adjective
       where you, like...
         That's a noun.
         - It's a word
   that describes something.
   - Like, what do you mean?
      - You're beautiful.
  "Beautiful" is an adjective.
         - So beautiful
       is the adjective.
           - Mm-hmm.
 - I'm going to put delicious.
     Is that an adjective?
          Yeah, that's
       a super adjective.
  - Come on, English lessons.
  - Ah, thank God I'm pretty.
      - Hey, kitty girls.
             - Hey.
            - Hello.
   - So how are things going
     in the magic queendom?
            - Great.
            - Good.
        Hi, Farrah Moan.
             - Ru!
             - Ru!
            - Rrrru!
    - What kind of princess
 will you be in this challenge?
        - She's gonna be
    an underwater socialite.
     She's gonna be, like,
on all the underwater tabloids.
          - Oh, okay.
        Now, do you sew?
          - I'm smart
    in a lot of other ways,
  but when it comes to fabrics
     and needles and stuff,
     I'm just not as, uh...
      uh, what's the word?
         - Proficient.
      - Proficient, yeah.
        - It's Season 9.
        How do you walk
       into the workroom
  without knowing how to sew?
        That's just sad.
    - How will you make sure
    that you shine through?
  - Um...I'm just going to be
      my cute little self
        and pray to your
    wax figurine over there
      that y'all like it.
            - Okay.
     Can't wait to see her.
        Thanks, Farrah.
      - Thank you so much.
       - Aja from the BK.
          - Ah, Ru-Ru.
  - Now, you know how to sew,
   so you got lots of skills.
             - Yes.
          - So tell me
      about your princess.
    - Her name is Disastah.
  She is a volcanic eruption,
           basically.
     She's kind of inspired
           by my mom.
      She's like an angry
      Puerto Rican woman.
           - Really.
   - I have a tattoo of her.
        It's right here.
     - That's your mother.
             - Yes.
       When she got mad,
    you see the red come up
       and her baby hairs
    will start crimpling up.
  It's like an eruption, girl.
       - Now, how are you
          gonna shine?
         - I just feel
     so confident about it.
I'm just like, I'm gonna do this
    and it's gonna be cute.
           - You know
    I've heard that before.
       Well, I can't wait
        to see Disastah.
    I'll let you get to it.
           Valentina.
  - I'm ready for my close-up,
          Mr. DeMille.
       - Oh, my goodness.
      Can I see your eyes?
          - Um, well,
     you see, the thing is,
    it's my very first time
       shaving my brows,
  and I'm kind of like nervous
      because I don't have
       my Brooke Shields
    "Blue Lagoon" eyebrows.
     - Oh! Oh, my goodness,
         look at there.
       Why don't you just
      shave them all off?
- Well, because I want to still
have a bit of boy brow to draw.
           - Uh-huh.
     - So that I don't look
       completely crazy.
   - Why are we looking at me
      when you said that?
            (laughs)
    Okay, so I want to hear
      about your princess.
    - She's an ice princess.
  She comes from planet Azula.
   - And that's nowhere near
         Azusa, is it?
      - Not anywhere near
       Azusa, California.
        - Yeah. (laughs)
  - I have a big imagination,
     and I'm really excited
        to get started.
      - See you out there.
         - Thanks, Ru.
       - Trinity Taylor.
          Now tell me
      about your princess.
        What's her name?
      - Farella Aquapussy.
      - She sounds juicy.
           And salty.
      - I kind of like it.
          - I do, too.
          - So tell me
      about her sidekick.
      - Well, her sidekick
    is Stanky the Starfish.
  And I was going to go with,
you know, a chocolate starfish.
           - Uh-huh.
   - But I decided, you know,
           kids want
      bright colors, so...
       - Kids don't know
 they want a chocolate starfish
       until they've had
     a chocolate starfish.
          - Oh, right.
          - You know?
  - I love chocolate starfish.
   - Are you kidding? I live
   for chocolate starfishes.
        But this is not
     a chocolate starfish.
    What kind of a starfish
            is this?
    - Well, he's going to be
      a country starfish.
  - Like from Cracker Barrel?
          (both laugh)
    Now, you came very close
     to winning last week.
     Any bitterness there?
      - No. I came close,
       but you know what?
   I do know that Ms. Thang,
            she won.
          Even though
     she's been doing drag
   a whole lot less than me,
     she's younger than me,
        Fuck that bitch.
           - (laughs)
    - She better watch out.
            - Okay.
       - 'Cause Aquapussy
           is coming.
      - Well, I can't wait
        to see Aquapussy
   out there on that runway.
           - Me, too.
           - (laughs)
       All right, ladies.
  Tomorrow on the main stage,
       you'll be debuting
   your fairytale princesses.
          So good luck
     and don't fuck it up!
   - I don't want to do this.
         I don't know.
         This is hard.
  I don't know what I'm doing.
       I just really want
        whatever I make
      to look good enough
          to be safe,
         because I know
   I'm not going to pump out
        no award-winning
      mermaid gown, honey.
     I just don't even know
        where to begin.
- Why don't you find a glue gun
 and your bra and work on that?
 - You know, I kind of pictured
     gluing fabric on a bra
      being a lot easier.
         This is, like,
      complicated as fuck.
   Like, I don't want to have
   to cut any piece of fabric
     and put it over this.
       - No, you're not.
     - This one won't fit.
  I can't get it to fit over.
             Look.
       - It's okay. Move.
       Sometimes you just
      gotta jump in, girl.
       - Oh, I love you.
        - I love Farrah
      and she's my bestie,
    but she literally sounds
   like a child all the time.
         It would make
    the world of difference
       if she would just
    stop bitching and do it.
       Just do it, girl.
        Don't be afraid
      of hot glue, bitch.
       You a drag queen.
    So what I would suggest
             you do
    is, like, glue shit all
   the way up this one side.
     I'm going to give you
    this base to work with,
       and then I'm gonna
  let you go shell from there.
          Find, like,
  your shiny stuff, seashells.
     - Oh, I broke a piece
       of this starfish.
            - Farrah
   is one of those princesses
   that whines all the time.
          Suck it up.
     This is a competition.
     We're here to compete
         for $100,000.
  One minute you're in and the
next minute, you're gone, honey.
         - Coming up...
    - Are you afraid of what
   America is going to think
         of your makeup
       without face tone?
     - Nope, 'cause I think
    I look almost the same.
       - Awkward silence.
  (RuPaul laughs, bell rings)
        (RuPaul laughs)
         - Oh, my God.
         - Get to work.
         - Here we go.
       - Back here again.
  - Good morning, cucu world.
           - (laughs)
    - It's elimination day.
          I'm nervous,
      but I'm also excited
  about my fairytale princess
            outfit.
     I'm about to give them
        Sewer Princess.
    - So when you say cucu,
        is like the hole
    or is it like the butt?
             'Cause
     I'm a little confused.
     - You know, it can be,
      like, the butthole,
       but let me explain
     the story real quick.
      When I was a child,
      mom doesn't want us
   to say bad words at home.
          So one day,
     I was three years old,
    trying to tell her that
  I need to go to the bathroom
        'cause I need to
   from my culo to go ca-ca.
         She slapped me
       with a chancleta.
   She said, like, mira mijo,
   let me tell you something.
 You're not gonna say bad word
      here in this house!
    So I was, like, scared.
    I was, like, what to do?
 I mean, what do you call this
         in your back?
       So scared one day
     after that situation,
      I said, cucu, mama,
     ca-ca, pee-pee. Okay.
        And since that,
          I say cucu.
         - So do I have
        a big cucu, too?
        - Girl, you do.
      Well, I have a cucu,
   but you have a CuCu, girl!
     - Oh, it feels so good
   to have these brows back.
        - I see you had
        an eyebrow lift.
        - Just a little.
    - Are you afraid of what
   America is going to think
         of your makeup
       without face tone?
     - Nope, 'cause I think
    I look almost the same.
       - Awkward silence.
- Everybody can get quiet, but I
think I look the same in photos.
       - Sometimes girls
 that come up via social media
    can get a lot of praise
        for the way they
   present themselves online.
     You got your filters.
     You got your Facetune.
        You got all that.
       However, it's how
     you apply that makeup,
     because sometimes when
   people see you in person,
   they can get a little bit
         disappointed.
         - So, Trinity,
    when you were in Orlando
 when that situation happened,
  like, were you freaked out?
            I mean,
   I know you're from there.
             Yeah.
    - Um, I actually wasn't
in Orlando at that very moment,
     but I'm a very former
          Miss Pulse.
           - (gasps)
   - And I entertained there
   literally the week before
     on their Latin night,
      'cause that happened
      on their Latin night.
         So it's scary
        to think, like,
         that literally
      could have been me.
       And so immediately
        my thought is...
      - Call your friends,
           I'm sure.
  - Oh, my God, who do I know?
         - Did you lose
   a lot of people, Trinity?
     - Well, I didn't know
       any of the people
         that actually
       lost their lives.
         I knew several
      of the entertainers
      that were trapped in
the dressing room that escaped.
   A lady that I worked with
         in my day job,
 one of her daughters had just
   graduated nursing school.
            And then
   her life was taken over...
         - Oh, my God.
     - Like, for no reason.
     - I'm so sorry, girl.
    - Well, let me tell you
   a story about the tragedy.
      - I know you know--
       you probably knew
         a lot of them
      because they were...
   - June 11, I was supposed
     to perform that night,
   but I have to reschedule.
   So Kenya Michaels, that is
 the cast director that night,
        she said, like,
        it's okay, mija.
         We can, like,
        reschedule you.
    And then, like, we were
     performing in Houston
       and we get, like,
       the text message.
       Like, oh, my God,
  we are here in the bathroom.
     We can't do anything.
   There's a guy with a gun,
   like, shooting everybody.
   And I'm like, oh, my God,
        are you serious?
      And, unfortunately,
       one of my friends
     died in that incident,
            Martin.
       And he was, like--
            I'm like
   two or three hours before,
         like, Cynthia,
        you're not here.
        You're supposed
        to have a show.
           That's why
      I came here tonight.
      And I'm like, baby.
         - Oh, Cynthia.
         - No, no, no.
      I just rescheduled.
  Oh. Do you want to go home?
        And he was like,
       no, you know what?
       I'm going to stay.
 I'm going to have a cute time.
      I miss you so much.
           And he was
    one of my first dancers,
       like, 10 years ago
   when I started doing drag.
   So it was a very traumatic
    situation for everybody.
      We never expect that
      a tragedy like this
    happen in our community
     or happen in our clubs
       because we thought
     that we finally built
          a safe place
       for our community.
       - We are not safe
        completely yet,
         and we're not
       accepted 100% yet.
    But we have to continue
       to live our lives.
We can't be stuck in our houses
 and afraid to go out and live.
    - Preach, girl. Preach!
   - What happened in Orlando
       at Pulse Nightclub
  was a defining and shocking
     moment for gay people.
       And the fact that
   it was an act of violence
  against LGBT people of color
   is not insignificant here.
        - Family, famo.
       - Love you, girls.
           - Family.
  - It's so important as queer
 entertainers to lead the way.
    We need to come together
 and be proudly visibly queer.
      - And you know what?
           Also, drag
      is a brilliant place
        to work through
       feelings of pain.
    - Girl, drag is therapy.
            - It is.
   - We can't move backwards.
    We need to stay strong.
        (RuPaul laughs)
           - At what?
  - Welcome to the main stage
    of "RuPaul's Drag Race."
      Look, it's my wicked
  stepsister Michelle Visage.
- Always the wicked stepsister,
        never the bride.
       - Style superstar
        Carson Kressley.
             Hi-ho.
           - Hi, ho!
        It's off to work
       with the Q we go.
           - (laughs)
     The prince of YouTube,
    actor, singer, director
         Todrick Hall.
    - Hi, Ru. You left your
  glass slipper in my bedroom.
    - It's a size 12, right?
           - Exactly.
    - And the fairest in all
  the land, Cheyenne Jackson.
   - Serving you butch queen
           since '75.
          (all laugh)
     - So glad you're here.
           This week,
    we challenged our queens
    to bring their princess
       fantasies to life,
          and tonight,
they're bringing it to the ball.
           Gentlemen,
       start your engines
  and may the best woman win.
          Coming up...
         - I literally
       had no clue at all
   what was going on tonight.
  (RuPaul laughs, bell dings)
        (RuPaul laughs)
        - Category is...
           First up,
     Cynthia Lee Fontaine,
       Princess Cuculina.
    - Hi, my name is Brulee.
      I'm here to protect
       Princess Cuculina
      from any booty slap
  and to show her that she can
   bring peace, love and sex
  to all the entire universe.
   My advice is a happy cucu
is one that is clean for others.
       - One in the pink?
          (all laugh)
          Peppermint,
    Princess Carcinogenetta.
           - My name
    is Petey the Pilot Light
        and I'm flaming.
 I live to help make her dream
  of fire unsafety come true.
  My advice to her is simple.
       Burn, baby, burn.
             Rawr.
 - Oh, it's not just her pussy
        that's on fire.
       (Michelle laughs)
         - Farrah Moan,
       Princess Pacifica.
    - Well, it's the snatch
          of the day.
           - My name
    is Fablina the blowfish.
    I'm Princess Pacifica's
        royal publicist.
        When I first met
       Princess Pacifica,
        she was abusing
      her royal privileges
 by partying from the Atlantic
        to the Pacific.
    I'm here to protect her
 from the grueling sharkarazzi
  and transform her reputation
     from swampy socialite
    to responsible princess
        of the Pacific.
        - Charlie Hides,
      Princess Climaxica.
           - My name
   is Isabella Snatchpacker,
  and I'm Princess Climaxica's
        lady in waiting.
          I first met
       Princess Climaxica
when she was studying languages
     at Galaxy University.
       Oh, she just loves
        foreign tongue.
   She's a cunning linguist,
           you know.
  I'm here to protect her from
 bad puns and double entendres.
        How am I doing?
  - Copper? I hardly know her.
          (all laugh)
           - Eureka,
  Princess You-Reek-of-Daria.
          - Here comes
   Princess You-Reek-of-Daria
    from the sewer kingdom.
   I am her faithful servant
          Woof-train.
          The princess
   was kicked out of topland.
      The army banned her
  to reign only in the sewers.
 I live to help make her dreams
 of being on the top a reality.
       - Alexis Michelle,
     Princess #SubwayFish.
  - My name is #SubwayTadpole,
     Princess SubwayFish's
         chief swimmer.
   We met for the first time
    when Princess SubwayFish
was taking the train to her gig.
  Whenever she bugging, I just
  tell her, just keep fishing.
   - Aw, don't be so crabby.
  - There's a cream for that.
         - Kimora Blac,
     Princess Banana Lady.
   - My name is Funky Monkey,
  Banana Lady's cute bodyguard
      from Banana Kingdom.
    I am here to protect her
from all the big bad jungle men
      with small bananas.
       I love to help her
         make her dream
  of banana digging come true.
        She is so rich,
    she got all the bananas
       she's ever wanted.
         - Nina Bo'nina
      Brown-Pinkett-Smith,
       Princess Zathena.
       - My name is Ink.
    I knew Princess Zathena
       back when she was
 a little hard-headed Martian.
  She was always the wild one
         of the bunch,
        wanting to breed
      with the human race.
     I'm here to teach her
      to love who she is.
    You are from the planet
       Bad Bitch Uranium,
    so you have to represent
      for the bad bitches.
  - I actually had a bad batch
        of Uranium once.
       (Michelle laughs)
   I sold it to the Russians.
     - I remember that day.
        - Sasha Velour,
        Princess Uglina.
      - Where my birds at?
        (RuPaul laughs)
       - My name is Lunk
       from Self Doubtia.
     I'm Princess Uglina's
       imaginary friend.
            It was I
   who trapped her in a cage,
     filling her mind with
    self doubt and weakness.
      But Princess Uglina
      wasn't scared of me.
    She embraced my darkness
      and showed me love,
      so I opened the cage
      and I set her free.
         - Shea Coulee,
       Princess Aquaria.
    - My name is Moon Pearl,
       Princess Aquaria's
     ice fairy from Uranus.
  Princess Aquaria was born in
the battle for love and freedom
   when her star mother fused
  with the Queen Moon Diamond.
  Whenever she's feeling lost,
          I remind her
     that her guiding star
          lives within
   and that she holds the key
         to unlock it.
  She'll be the most sickening
   princess in the universe.
    - Why don't you come up
    and seaweed me sometime?
            No? No?
   Valentina, Princess Vira.
    - Where is Vira's wang?
      - My name is Netty,
Princess Vira's shady godmother.
             I live
     to help make her dream
 of freezing over the universe
      via shade come true.
      My advice is simple:
         hate everyone.
            Someday
    she'll be the shadiest,
   most evilest queen of all
            and live
     hatefully ever after.
   - Aja, Princess Disastah.
        - I almost wore
 that same outfit today, so...
           - Did you?
             - Yep.
     - My name is Dasistah,
  and I am Princess Disastah's
          smoke cloud.
         I live to make
      her dreams come true
         of coal mining
  and becoming a gold digger.
       Someday she'll be
     the most ashy princess
        and she'll live
     flamingly ever after.
       - Orange you glad
    you got fire insurance?
      (Michelle chuckles)
       - Trinity Taylor,
    Princess Aquapussy. Oh.
      - Oh, surf and turf.
           - My name
    is Stanky the Starfish,
  the royal redneck counselor.
          We first met
       when the princess
  was in the waterland clinic
    hitting her itch cream.
    It was for her outbreak,
           clam-idia.
      I hope that someday
     she can find the cure
         for this WTD.
        That stands for
   water transmitted disease.
           - (laughs)
  Ooh, pass the tartar sauce.
          (all laugh)
         - Coming up...
      - I'm no seamstress,
      but that looks like
       a piece of fabric
       around your waist.
        - Your sidekick
      had no personality.
      - Fucking go for it.
  (RuPaul laughs, bell dings)
        (RuPaul laughs)
       - Welcome, ladies.
     When I call you name,
      please step forward.
     Cynthia Lee Fontaine,
         Charlie Hides,
            Eureka,
        Alexis Michelle,
         Sasha Velour,
      Nina Bo-nina Brown,
          Shea Coulee.
      Ladies, you're safe.
    You may leave the stage.
     Ladies, you represent
          this week's
    beauties and the beasts.
             - Oh.
          - Let's hear
        from the judges,
   starting with Peppermint.
   - I just liked the way you
created this kind of fire idea.
      I think the details
  on the dress are impressive.
           - I loved
     Petey the Pilot Light.
          - Thank you.
     When I was a teenager,
  I was cooking at home alone
     and the entire kitchen
        caught on fire,
  and I've been deathly afraid
         of fire since.
           So I said,
      let me do something
     that's going to tackle
            my fear.
           - Only you
   can prevent grease fires.
           - (laughs)
    - Next up, Farrah Moan.
         - Every year,
  Ru and Michelle tell people
    you cannot come out here
     with a piece of fabric
   wrapped around your waist.
     And I'm no seamstress,
      but that looks like
       a piece of fabric
   wrapped around your waist.
- The sidekick, the eye make-up
     thing was distracting
  'cause to me, it looked like
 you were reading a script that
 was maybe down in your hands.
            - I was.
           - Oh, see?
 - I was just kind of let down
      with the character.
   Like, this is your chance,
     so fucking go for it.
    - Up next, Kimora Blac.
            - Hello.
  - You didn't really sell me
   on what your princess is.
            For me,
   that was a little lacking.
           - And then
   your sidekick was robotic
           and really
      had no personality.
       - You seemed like
     you just couldn't wait
      for it to get over.
         - For so long,
    I've been hiding behind
   a breastplate and padding.
        I'm pretty known
          for my butt,
     and I've been padding
          for so long
        that I'm kind of
      uncomfortable again.
      And it's been hard.
   - Thank you, Kimora Blac.
          - Thank you.
     - Up next, Valentina.
         - I wrote down
       Linda Evangelista.
         The smoky eye
  and the nude lip, I like it.
        (RuPaul laughs)
         - This outfit
      is really gorgeous,
       and your sidekick,
   I loved that it was about
         shade and ice.
     - Because oftentimes,
          evil people
  come in beautiful packages,
      as we see every day.
         - Oh, my God.
           - (laughs)
    - Thank you, Valentina.
           - Gracias.
        - Next up, Aja.
         - I literally
       had no clue at all
   what was going on tonight
        with your story
       as your princess.
       - She's a volcano,
      she's from Brooklyn,
      she's from bad side,
          she's banji.
  She's just going to the club
      to go hang out with
  her little clouds and stuff.
    - Did anybody get that?
             - No.
             - No.
      I think that even if
    you wanted to be banji,
    there was a way to do it
      and have it just be
    slightly more polished.
      - I also think that
   your makeup is very dark.
    - Yeah, we can't really
         see your eyes.
  - And it's been kind of dark
      this whole journey.
   - Up next, Trinity Taylor.
      Princess Aquapussy.
         - When I first
        heard your name,
      I just kept thinking
        of James Bond...
    (imitating Sean Connery)
    like Princess Aquapussy.
          (all laugh)
          - You know,
       I loved this look.
         I thought that
   from a fashion standpoint,
    that this is really fun.
     And then you showed us
         your starfish.
         - Itch cream.
    - You come across to me
        as pageant girl,
        so seeing you do
     something like Stanky
     is just going to bode
      really well for you.
    Keeping with that comedy
         is a good road
      for you to go down.
          - Thank you.
   - Thank you, my pretties.
  I think we've heard enough.
  While you untuck backstage,
        the judges and I
        will deliberate.
  All right. Now, just between
     us wicked stepmothers,
       what do you think,
   starting with Peppermint?
      - Peppermint made me
   very, very happy tonight.
The minute she stepped onstage,
 you knew what she was selling.
     - I love when someone
   takes an inanimate object
     and makes a character
           out of it.
   - She used something that
  wasn't a really good memory
   and turned it into a plus.
           I thought
       it was very smart.
          Farrah Moan.
  - Obviously, she's gorgeous,
   but there was no presence.
          It was just
      a huge, giant mess.
        - Her blowfish,
      it was a great idea,
           but I left
     a little unsatisfied.
 It just--that closed eye thing
          didn't work.
  I was more distracted by it
    than I was entertained.
 - I have a secret to tell you.
            - What?
   - My eyes have been closed
        the whole show.
       (Michelle laughs)
            - What?
         - Kimora Blac.
        - Funky Monkey.
        It was like that
     Teen Miss USA pageant
  who said, most US Americans
          of the Korea
     or the South Africa...
    - It was hard to watch,
         I have to say.
     - I think we all need
        to take a moment
         to talk about
  the bravest struggle of all,
 coming out here and telling us
     about her struggle...
        - Her struggle.
  - With not wearing hip pads.
    - Not wearing hip pads?
            My God!
        Can you be alive
   and still be made a saint?
       - No, but I think
   we can make arrangements.
           - (laughs)
           Valentina.
       - Three for three.
 Each episode, you look at her
        and we've gotten
         to this point
   where we can't wait to see
      what she looks like
         because she's
     so frigging beautiful,
   we all just want to go up
       and lick her face.
    - Both of her characters
         were stunning
    as far as presentation.
      - And I have to say,
     I was really surprised
        with her comedy.
           I thought
     she really went there.
             - Aja.
     - Aja definitely chose
        the right name:
       Princess Disastah.
           - (laughs)
   - Because that was an epic
     proportion earthquake.
    - I don't understand why
  the chaps with the volcano.
      - Well, the costume
      didn't say volcano.
      It said Heat Miser.
           - (laughs)
       - She's charming,
  but it was a hot lava mess.
       - Trinity Taylor.
   - I liked the whole look.
      It's very Kooky Sue.
 - And then Stanky the Starfish
    was a great counterpart.
          - Clam-idia.
          - It made me
       so frigging happy.
   I couldn't stop laughing.
   - And I also feel that she
 interacted with her character
            more so
   than all the other girls.
    - Really, it can just be
     summed up by one word.
         - What's that?
   - (imitating Sean Connery)
           Aquapussy.
           - Silence.
     I've made my decision.
      Bring back my girls.
  (RuPaul laughs, bell dings)
        (RuPaul laughs)
    - Welcome back, ladies.
   I've made some decisions.
         Peppermint...
          You're safe.
          - Thank you.
         - Kimora Blac.
  The judges were not a fan of
          your banana.
  I'm sorry, my dear, but you
    are up for elimination.
  - This is the worst feeling
         in the world.
   It sucks to be here again.
       - Trinity Taylor.
   You wished upon a starfish
   and your dreams came true.
       Con-drag-ulations.
       You're the winner
   of this week's challenge.
             - Aah!
           (applause)
- You've won a $2,000 gift card
          from Casper.
          - Thank you.
         - You may join
        the other girls.
     - Girl, I finally won
      my first challenge.
        I have arrived,
     and these other girls
       need to watch out.
 - Valentina, your ice princess
        was totally hot.
          You're safe.
          - Thank you.
         - Farrah Moan.
        I hate to burst
         your bublina,
    but your blowfish blew.
  Aja, the judges did not lava
    your princess storyline.
    Aja, I'm sorry, my dear,
 but you're up for elimination.
       - I feel confused.
   I definitely think Farrah
  should be in the bottom two,
            not me.
  - Farrah Moan, you may join
        the other girls.
       - Thank you, guys.
             (sobs)
          - Two queens
        stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last chance
         to impress me
       and save yourself
       from elimination.
       The time has come
          to lip sync
    (echoing) for your life!
           Good luck,
     and don't fuck it up.
         (music plays)
     (cheers and applause)
           - Ladies,
     I've made my decision.
    Aja, shantay, you stay.
           (applause)
         - Work, girl.
         - You may join
        the other girls.
      - Thank you so much.
     - You did that, bitch.
         - Kimora Blac,
  you bravely bared your soul
         and your ass.
          - (chuckles)
     - Stay strong, sister.
        Now sashay away.
        - Love you guys.
         - We love you.
     (cheers and applause)
         - I'm pretty.
            (laughs)
    I'm a little surprised.
     It's too early for me.
  The judges hated my monkey.
   I hated that monkey, too.
            I think
  what I would do differently
         is to research
     on how to be a monkey,
    'cause that is something
    that I would never think
 I would do in my entire life.
       But I did my best,
     and I looked gorgeous.
     And I want to be known
   as one of the pretty ones.
      - Con-drag-ulations,
           my queens.
         Now, remember,
  if you can't love yourself,
        how in the hell
 you gonna love somebody else?
       Can I get an amen
          up in here?
            - Amen.
            - Amen.
          - All right.
    Now, let the music play.


        - How you doing,
          <i> mis amores?</i>
      Are you ready to see
        my Coo-Coo again?
     (laughter and applause)
      I'm back,<i> mis amores.</i>
         - Welcome back,
      Cynthia Lee Fontaine.
      - #JusticeForCooCoo.
       - Guide me, Jesus.
           - I'm back.
          - Oh, my God.
     Welcome back, Cynthia.
           - Oh, God.
        - Congratulations
         to the winner.
       - Thank you, doll.
           Thank you.
   And congrats on you getting
    better with your health.
   - It was a roller coaster.
            - Right.
   - But, you know, I'm here.
      I was diagnosed with
     liver cancer stage one,
      but I'm in remission
  and I feel healthier as ever.
           My Coo-Coo
       is fantastic, girl.
       I'm not gonna take
         the opportunity
   that RuPaul has given to me
           in granted.
     This Coo-Coo is ready.
          This is home.
     - I don't want to sound
    like a hater or anything,
       but, like, is this,
          like, a joke
           or are you
     legitimately back, sis?
        - Baby, I'm back.
             I know
     I'm Miss Congeniality,
      but I'm no came here
         to play games.
    - I'm happy that Cynthia
  is getting her second chance,
     but on the other hand,
          I'm like, oh,
        we got this bitch
       that already knows
        this competition,
      and that can get you
         very, very far.
          - I'm afraid
     of what's coming next.
   This just got real, honey.
            - Ha-ha!
  - (sighs) I'm not very happy
      that Cynthia is back.
     She could take us out.
     - Hallelujah, my pussy
   and my Coo-Coo is burning.
    - I haven't yet seen this
   infamous Coo-Coo of yours,
      and I need to see it,
   because if you're gonna say
       Coo-Coo around me,
   you better make sure yours
     looks better than mine.
             - Ooh.
          - The winner
     of "RuPaul's Drag Race"
   receives a one-year supply
   of Anastasia Beverly Hills
            cosmetics
        and a cash prize
          of $100,000.
       With extra special
     guest judges the B-52s.
         - Good morning.
  - I didn't know this Coo-Coo
      was happening today.
             (alarm)
             - Ooh!
           - She done
    already done had herses.
       - If you can't love
            yourself,
             let me.
      I'm your biggest fan.
        Your number one.
   Well, technically, only one
    of you can be number one,
       so the rest of you
       are, like, losers.
         Sorry about it.
           (all laugh)
     - Hello, hello, hello!
    (screaming and cheering)
      - Lisa mother fucking
             Kudrow.
          I am gagged.
   - Lady Gaga was just here,
      and now Lisa Kudrow.
  I'm really digging Season 9.
       - Say hi to my pal
          Lisa Kudrow.
      (cheers and applause)
              - Hi.
      - I just ran into her
           on the lot,
   and she wanted to come over
         and say hello.
  - Yeah, you guys look great.
       - Oh, my God, stop.
           - (laughs)
 - Lisa's character Val Cherish
     from the brilliant show
         "The Comeback,"
          is the reason
    I say hello, hello, hello
           every time
    I walk into the workroom.
       Did you know that?
              - No!
      - I didn't know that.
        - Neither did I.
           (all laugh)
   - Now, Lisa, would you mind
      saying that one thing
          that you say
         for me, please?
        - Well, I got it.
           (all laugh)
        - That was good,
   but can you say it happier?
        - Well, I got it.
        - Bigger, bigger.
        - Well, I got it!
           (all laugh)
     Now I look like a fool.
           - (laughs)
    Lisa, come back any time.
         - Okay, thanks.
      - Thank you, darling.
           Mwah, mwah.
      (cheers and applause)
             - Bye!
        - Ladies, I have
  a little secret to tell you.
    When I was a little kid,
  I wanted to be a cheerleader.
           (cheering)
    I loved the short skirts,
       the sassy comebacks
   and the death drop splits.
       So for this week's
         maxi challenge,
       you'll be competing
     in the biggest, baddest
    cheer battle in herstory.
          #QueerCheers.
           (all laugh)
    First, you need to divide
        into two squads.
   Nina Bo'nina Brown, you won
     last week's challenge,
    and Cynthia Lee Fontaine,
          you're back,
      so I'm making you two
       head cheerleaders.
     Pick your squads. Nina.
         - Shea Coulee.
           - Ha! Aah!
       - Ooh, you playing
         the race card?
           (all laugh)
            Cynthia.
            - Kimora.
              - Oh.
    - My team is going to be
        the Coo-Coo team.
            - Alexis.
            - Eureka!
         - Oh, come on.
             - Aja.
           (applause)
         - Farrah Moan.
       - Oh, team Coo-Coo,
        team Coo-Coo, go!
        - I choose Sasha.
             - Yes!
           (applause)
          - Peppermint.
           (applause)
  - Because I have a heart for
 the underdog, I choose Jaymes.
              - Aw.
              - Aw.
      - She was just doing
       community service.
              - Oh!
          - I'm feeling
     a little self conscious
       about being labeled
          an underdog,
    because I consider myself
     very much a competitor.
          - All right.
        Welcome, Trinity.
              Yes!
       - I choose Charlie.
           (applause)
    - Which means Valentina,
    you're on Coo-Coo's team.
     - I feel like Valentina
         was picked last
             because
     she's already mentioned
   she's only been doing drag
         for 10 months.
   So I think we're all like,
    well, what can she bring?
     - It doesn't feel good
       to be chosen last,
           but little
      do these queens know
       that in their team
     they got the superstar.
   - Team Nina Bo'nina Brown,
       you'll be cheering
       for the home team,
       RuPaul's Glamazons.
          - Yes, honey.
             - Yes.
       - And Team Coo-Coo,
       you'll be cheering
      for our extra special
    guest judges, the B-52s.
             - Yes!
           (applause)
     - Kate, Fred and Cindy
       gave me a big break
when they cast me in their music
     video for "Love Shack."
             - Ooh!
           - Oh, yeah!
     - All right, gentlemen,
       start your engines.
   And may the best woman win.
          - So anybody
    have any insight so far?
       - There's literally
        like an adjective
     for every single queen.
            - Mm-hmm.
          - So I think
    we should go through that
  and assess, like, who matches
    the description the most.
   - Doll, I want to be sassy.
             - Okay.
       - Can I be flirty?
      - You can have that.
       - I think that now
      would be a great time
         for Jaymes to--
     if you want to, like--
        - Yes, to really
          show himself.
- If you do snoozy in funny way,
       it would be funny.
        - I think floozy
         is more my role
      'cause it's all about
           high energy
          and all about
       being over the top.
      - Impact, yeah, yeah.
        - I want floozy.
             - Ooh.
      - Take snoozy, girl.
       It'll be hilarious.
         It'll be great.
         I'm not snoozy.
     I'm just--it's not me.
       - Honestly, Alexis,
           I feel like
       even though, like,
   snoozy may be a challenge,
  I think it's a challenge that
   you can definitely rise to.
   - The other girls assure me
      and encourage me that
     I can make snoozy work.
       You're right, girl.
     I can do any of these.
   - And these are characters.
    - And you're sure you're
     comfortable with that?
    - I'll do whatever, yeah.
       And they're right.
         I'm an actress.
 - Should we, like, stand up and
  do it, just so we have like--
       - Yeah, do you want
       to get it off the--
           - Ru call.
    - I'm Charlie, I'm boozy.
    - I'm Alexis, I'm snoozy.
    - Jaymes, I'm Jews--ugh.
      - I'm Aja, I'm sassy.
      - I'm Nina, I'm assy.
    - I'm Jaymes and I'm--oh.
  I'm Jaymes and I'm a floozy.
    - Wait, wait, wait, wait.
     I don't think your part
       comes in that late.
   - You got to jump right in.
          - Yeah, yeah.
     - It's got a slow beat
             to it.
    - No, but you have to do
         the first beat.
       - You start in time
and then you stretch the floozy.
    - I'm Charlie, I'm boozy.
    - I'm Alexis, I'm snoozy.
        - And I'm Jaymes
        and I'm a floozy.
   - Captain, may I speak out
    of turn for a little bit?
          - Of course.
            Go ahead.
             - Girl,
     you gotta sell floozy.
 If you wanted to be the floozy,
    you gotta be the floozy.
          - All right.
 - I'm not seeing it yet, okay?
            I'm not--
    I want to encourage you.
     I'm just saying, do it.
          Do it, girl.
          Come forward.
      - Jaymes doesn't seem
      to be here mentally,
    and this is not the time
    to be figuring out how to
   get your mind in the game.
   It already has to be there.
   - It's gonna be a long day.
         - Coming up...
             - Whoo!
             - Aah!
          - Oh, my God!
      I cannot believe what
    they are asking us to do.
   - There's gonna be a severe
     injury on this episode.
   (RuPaul laughs, bell dings)
         (RuPaul laughs)
       - All right, guys.
    Five, six, seven, eight.
            Let's go!
    - Today's maxi challenge
        is a straight up
       "Bring It On" style
      cheer battle, bitch.
      - Why don't we do it
         one more time.
   I'm gonna sing it with you
    so we can get it in time.
       Let's do it again.
  - This is gonna sound crazy,
     but what if we go back
  to your idea you had before?
           - Of what?
    - Oh, you want to switch?
    - Where I do more of the
  character and you do flirty.
   - Do you want to try that?
              Okay.
             - Yeah.
             - Okay.
    - 'Cause that way, if I'm
  coming right behind somebody,
       it's easier for me
          to keep time.
    - And that's a good idea.
              Okay.
         So I'm gonna--
     we're gonna switch now.
     - We'll switch it out.
  - The decision to have Alexis
  and Jaymes switch characters
     is the right decision.
     We're all thinking it.
      It's gonna be better
     for everyone concerned.
    - I'm Charlie, I'm boozy.
      - Jaymes, I'm floozy.
    - We are actually rooting
           for Jaymes
     and want him to shine,
       but he's gonna have
      to believe in himself
         to really sell
         this challenge.
    - One, two, three, four,
    five, six, seven, eight.
   - It's time for rehearsal.
       - One, two, three.
           (cheering)
         - Ay dios mio!
   My Coo-Coo is just shaking
           right now.
       - All right, guys.
            I'm Dom.
         I'm a two-time
  world cheerleading champion,
 and I'm here to teach you guys
  a competitive cheer routine.
          - All right.
      - It's gonna consist
        of some tumbling,
   some jumping, some stunts.
           We're gonna
     have to work together,
   but you're also gonna have
    to learn how to stand out
        at the same time.
      We're gonna start it
         with stunting.
        - I am so pissed.
      I don't know who even
    does cartwheels anymore.
   It's not even the eighties.
  - So what you're going to do
       is dip down on one,
            stand up,
       lock out your legs,
   squeeze your tush and hold.
         - Oh, my gosh.
   - Five, six, seven, eight.
     One and three, dip one,
          straight leg.
             - Ooh!
             - Wow!
          - Oh, my God!
      I cannot believe what
    they are asking us to do.
     - Dip one, then three.
              - Oh!
        - Okay, make sure
     when you go back down,
            you reach
      for their shoulders.
   - There's gonna be a severe
     injury on this episode.
       - Valentina, ready?
       Dip one, up, three.
   - I was literally shaking,
but I said to myself, Valentina,
      when in doubt, smile.
     - One, two, down three.
     Okay. Can we switch out
         the fliers now?
             Ready.
  And five, six, seven, eight.
     Dip one, straight legs.
              - Oh!
             Bitch,
     I'm scared of heights.
           Oh, my God!
     This is scary as fuck!
      If I fall, it's gonna
        fuck up my face.
         - Then, three.
              - Oh!
            - My face
     is definitely expensive
        and I don't want
        to mess that up.
           No, ma'am.
     Oh, that's not for me.
  - We are feeling the pressure
          and the burn.
        Although the burn
    might be something else.
              - Oh.
          - All right.
             - Yes.
  - We're back in the workroom
    and we're all frantically
         doing our part
     to get our looks ready
   for our cheer competition.
        We have our work
         cut out for us.
      - We all have to look
            amazing.
    - I don't have bloomers.
    - I'm gonna wear tights.
      - Yeah, but you still
    have to have panties on.
      - No, I'm not wearing
      anything underneath.
             - What?
    - So if you go like this,
       it just looks like
         Barbie crotch?
    - Why am I being attacked
        of being a woman?
- Women wear bloomers underneath
   their cheerleading clothes.
     - Not the slutty ones.
           (all laugh)
    Fine, I'll wear panties.
           - (laughs)
 - RuPaul Glamazons, we're gonna
     teach you how to stunt
   so we can do some pyramids.
      Ready, and five, six,
          seven, eight.
     Dip one, two and three.
- Should the inside of the palms
          be together?
     - As close as you can.
             - Okay.
   - Don't think about looking
        straight forward.
   Turn your head to the side.
  You're gonna get a face full.
     - That's not a problem.
           (all laugh)
     - You think you got it?
            - (sighs)
     I'm thinking to myself,
   it's probably not the sport
           for people
    with an AARP membership.
     - And dip one in three.
      Good. Straight arms.
    Try and lift those knees
        up to your chest.
  And five, six, seven, eight.
      Dip one, two, three.
       How are we feeling?
           - Fabulous.
           (all laugh)
        We're gonna need
         stunt doubles.
- You guys, I can't even believe
     I'm still stoning this.
          Like, this is
        hard labor work.
           This is why
    I pay people to do this.
      - Stoning really does
          feed my soul.
       - It does me, too.
      I love to put sparkle
         on everything.
            - I think
    when you stone anything,
       it's just an excuse
          to look great
         without really
        even being great.
   Stoning is for ugly girls.
       Don't get me wrong,
     but I think all of us,
       we kind of grew up
     differently, you know.
    Like, some of us love to,
      like, create things.
       - Well, some of us
         don't love it.
   Some of us have to do this
           to survive.
         Sewing all day
       makes my back hurt,
      and I eventually get
     so creatively exhausted
       that I just despise
  looking at my crafting room.
         But I know that
     if I don't go in there,
 I'm not gonna be able to go to
the buffet that I want to later.
           (all laugh)
     - Sister, I'll take you
     to the buffet with me.
         - Well, bitch,
     you take me to a buffet
   and I'll sew you something.
    - So can you finish this
          for me then?
      - Kimora is gorgeous,
      but that attitude...
      - I'm getting tired,
       I'm getting thirsty
     and I'm getting, like,
       anxiety right now.
        - Not cute, girl.
              - Oh!
         - Coming up...
             - Wait!
        - Uh, this is my
      virgin de Guadalupe.
 I've really been praying to her
       every single night.
       - You crazy, bitch.
   (RuPaul laughs, bell dings)
         (RuPaul laughs)
             - Yay!
             - Yeah.
       - Day two, whores.
   - Glamazons are gonna kick
        the B-52s asses.
      - So today is the day
     we're about to perform
       this mother fucking
        cheer challenge.
          - Wait! Girl!
         Do you really?
        - Oh, this is my
      virgin de Guadalupe.
   I wish I could turn her on,
but I really been praying to her
       every single night
      just to watch over me
          and guide me
      through this process.
         - Who, Madonna?
              - No,
     la virgin de Guadalupe.
       - You crazy, bitch.
     That's some crazy shit.
           - Everybody
    gets to have a drag mom,
         but I feel like
     la virgin de Guadalupe
         is my drag mom.
     She helped get me here.
           She's gonna
        help me win, too.
      (praying in Spanish)
       Please help me win
         this challenge.
         I need to win.
      Love you, thank you.
          - Did you do
       high school sports?
   - I played tennis and then
   I did swimming and diving.
     And I think the diving
      kind of helped me out
     with this a little bit.
       - Yeah. Girl, I did
    high school cheerleading.
             - Yes.
       - We never did no--
          Girl, it was
      a black high school.
      We, like, you know...
        - Right. (laughs)
       - I'll never forget
        I was in the gym
   with all the cheerleaders.
  Some of the girls were like,
      oh, what do you think
  about that basketball player
           over there?
         He was so fine.
            - Boing.
        - Like, gorgeous
           cocoa skin.
         And I was like,
    oh, he's cute, he's cute.
     And later on, at lunch,
I see the entire basketball team
          looking at me
    like I'm about to get it.
    So I get up and I'm like,
  let me get out of here early.
          I'm by myself
        in the stairwell,
 and the entire basketball team
       comes up the steps,
       and one of the boys
    beats the hell out of me.
            - (gasps)
           - No, Pep.
          - It's true.
      But afterwards, I was
    talking to the secretary,
     told her what happened.
        And you know how
     the high school offices
           have, like,
       all glass windows.
            - Uh-huh.
      - So I turned around,
          and I swear,
        the entire school
         was just there.
          It felt like
        a circle of love.
    Like, people were crying,
   my friends were out there.
     So I felt pretty good,
            you know.
      And he got expelled.
           - Right on.
       - I stayed captain
   of the cheerleading squad.
           - Come on.
  - When I was in high school,
        I was singled out
      for being different.
      After that incident,
         I had strangers
       reaching out to me,
      and I knew right away
        that I was loved,
      and that felt great.
      - Cynthia, your story
        really touched me
      because I have a lot
     of people in my family
      who have had cancer,
    and, like, and who have--
         who have passed
        because of that.
          - Oh, my God.
  - I just wanted to make sure
    that you're okay, because
      I know your struggle
  which was hard, and it really
        touched my heart.
          - Thank you.
           Girl, whoo!
        It's a challenge.
   Everything was a real mess.
     I get my results and it
   was liver cancer stage one.
      So I was like, what?
   You know, I mean, I just...
     I was living my dream,
     and now I need to face,
       like, liver cancer.
           I was sad.
        I was really sad.
     It's hard when you know
     that you have a disease
       and maybe probably
       could be, you know,
   the last days of your life.
             I mean,
  the immune system goes down.
         So even a cold,
     it can possibly, like,
     kill you, so, I mean--
     - It's unreal to think
       that you could die.
        - At any moment.
          - Any moment.
     - But let me tell you.
        I'm in remission.
    - Cynthia is living proof
   that cancer is not the end.
       - Whoo! Group hug.
      We need a group hug.
         - If anything,
  she's stronger competing now.
    It has given her a drive
       to really succeed,
       and she's doing it
           with beauty
   and with a sense of humor,
   and that's a drag we need.
  - #KickingCancerintheCooCoo.
           (cheering)
         (RuPaul laughs)
            And what?
   - Welcome to the main stage
    of "RuPaul's Drag Race."
      My head cheerleader,
        Michelle Visage.
        How's your head?
          - Haven't had
         any complaints.
           - (laughs)
And everybody's grooving because
         it's the B-52s.
      Hey, is your tin roof
          still rusted?
          - Ooh, yeah.
           - Oh, yeah.
          - Yeah, baby.
          - This week,
    our queens are competing
     in the biggest, baddest
       cheer battle ever.
       Let's check in with
   our very own Ross Mathews.
           - Yes, Ru,
      this is so exciting!
         It smells like
          queen spirit.
          I'm actually
       literally gagging.
          Back to you.
         - Thanks, Ross.
       We'll be watching.
           Gentlemen,
       start your engines,
   and may the best woman win.
          Coming up...
             - Whoo!
              - Ow!
          (bell dings)
         (RuPaul laughs)
      - It's the "RuPaul's
           Drag Race"
   Cheer Battle Extravaganza!
       RuPaul's Glamazons
    versus the B-52 Bombers.
           - Ru call.
      - I'm Aja, I'm sassy.
      - I'm Nina, I'm assy.
     - I'm Shea, I'm flirty.
     - I'm Sasha, I'm dirty.
    - I'm Charlie, I'm boozy.
    - I'm Jaymes, I'm snoozy.
          - I'm Alexis
        and I'm a floozy.
      All: We are RuPaul's
           Glamazons.
   Got our tucking panties on.
    Our beat is unstoppable.
    Our wigs are unclockable.
    All: All right, work it,
       work it, all right.
    - B-52 Bombers, let's go!
   - I'm Coo-Coo, I'm naughty.
    - I'm Kimora, I'm slutty.
    - I'm Eureka, I'm wacky.
    - I'm Trinity, I'm tacky.
    - I'm Farrah, I'm thorny.
        - I'm Peppermint,
           I'm corny.
        - I'm Valentina,
         I'm also corny.
           (all laugh)
        All: Our lobsters
          are rocking.
    Our love is in the shack.
          We're roaming
        'cause we wanna,
      so haters step back.
         ALL: B-50-who?
       Not as cool as Ru.
      RuPaul is more fierce
    than Kate could ever be.
      More woman than Fred
    and more man than Cindy.
    All: RuPaul is shameless,
  selling candy bars and more.
             - Ugh!
   All: She even had a perfume
    and it was called Whore.
           (all laugh)
   All: Your beehive's busted.
    Your songs are too slow.
      You should go retire
      in a private Ida-ho.
         - And it's time
    for the tumbling package.
         (whistle blows)
        - Yeah, big girl.
      Come on, bitch, yes.
           Holy fuck.
             I land
     and I feel my knee pop.
   But I knew there was no way
         I was stopping.
      Bitch, I'm on a roll.
             - Whoo!
             - Aah!
   - Now, that was impressive.
    - Valentina surprised me.
    I feel a little bit like,
           oh, my God.
       I choose her last,
      but she came to slay.
       - Ms. Jaymes? Girl.
             - Whoo!
             - Whoo!
         - There we go.
          (horn blows)
  - Now the ladies will move on
       to the group dance.
             - Whoo!
              Whoo!
      (cheers and applause)
   - Five, six, seven, eight.
      - Glamazons, Bombers,
      the battle raging on.
     This cheer ain't over.
        Now bring it on!
    - When I get all the way
         up to the top,
        I feel like, yes,
       I'm a cheerleader.
              - Oh!
             - Whoo!
      (cheers and applause)
 - The judges are going to have
 a tough time scoring this one.
      I feel bad for them.
            Oh, wait.
        I'm a judge. Uh.
        - The category is
      white party realness.
       Nina Bo'nina Brown
           Zeta Jones.
    - Glamazon Shazaam-a-zon.
   - When Nina Bo'nina Banana
      Osama bin Laden Brown
     hits the runway, child,
        I'm a bad bitch.
   - Hungry, hungry hip pads.
             - Ooh.
       - Alexis Michelle.
       - Do these earrings
      make my ass look fat?
     - I'm serving glamour,
    but I've got it turned on
   its ear just a little bit.
       - Tin roof frosted.
           (all laugh)
          Shea Coulee.
         - I'll have two
     vanilla cones, please.
   - I'm serving you chocolate
     sixties bodacious babe.
         - Remember when
   we used to do white lines?
             - Whoo!
           - (laughs)
        - Charlie Hides.
       - Very Linda Evans
         from "Dynasty."
    - The outfit is amazing.
      I look like a fashion
 illustration of the Snow Queen.
           - You know,
      she's from the hood.
         - Sasha Velour.
     - I've taken a classic
    silhouette and updated it
  with a commitment to showing
      women who are strong.
 - You know what they say about
   girls who wear white pumps.
         - True hooker.
            - Mm-hmm.
             - Aja.
     - Where's my fava beans
          and chianti?
       - I believe that's
  a whitening strip, actually.
       - I'm an Illuminati
            princess.
    They tried to silence me,
    and I'm like, no, bitch,
      I'm still gonna talk.
     - Now you Khali-see me,
         now you don't.
             - Hmm.
       - Jaymes Mansfield.
       - Gentlemen prefer
          a white muff.
        - My look is fun.
           It's campy.
        I look fabulous.
    - The girl can't help it.
     - Oh, I'm sure she can.
     - Cynthia Lee Fontaine.
   - Oh, my goodness, I think
      I'm having a déjà Ru.
         - I'm going to
       the most expensive
     white party ever, okay?
       - My fair Coo-Coo.
           - (laughs)
         - Farrah Moan.
    - I like the peek-a-boos.
        - I'm giving you
      a little bit of ass,
      a little bit of class
     and some broken glass.
   - She is quite the hipster.
           Valentina.
              - Oh.
           - Nice day
      for a white wedding.
    - I'm inspired by my mom
    and dad's wedding video.
     My mom was known as the
beautiful bride in her hometown,
           and I want
     to tell you that story.
- If anybody has any objections,
        shut the fuck up.
        - Yeah. (laughs)
         Trinity Taylor.
     - I think a UFO landed.
   - My ass looks really good
      in these white pants.
  They look like two snowballs
         just juggling.
  - I hear she comes in piece.
           (all laugh)
         - Kimora Blac.
          - Now that's
     my kind of patriotism.
  - I'm going to a white party
            on a boat
        with hot sailors,
    and we're gonna have fun.
  - I don't think she'll sink,
             do you?
        - She comes with
    her own flotation device.
           Peppermint.
        Ooh, winter mint.
          - I've chosen
    an Elvis Presley-inspired
   rock 'n' roll extravaganza.
      - That pearl necklace
      seems to be dripping.
            - Eureka.
    Honey, it's milking time.
            - Uh-huh.
    - I'm giving you glamour,
    androgynous Glamazonian,
         big tuna fish.
            - Eureka,
    like the vacuum cleaner?
    - Yes, and she can suck.
 - Maybe I won't have my mother
        watch this show.
           (all laugh)
         - Coming up...
   - You were so fun to watch.
      - Space age fashion,
           I adore it.
  - You're like a drug dealer.
     Gave me a little dose.
         I wanted more.
           (all laugh)
   (RuPaul laughs, bell dings)
         (RuPaul laughs)
       - Welcome, ladies.
            This week
     you competed as teams,
      but you'll be judged
         as individuals.
     When I call your name,
      please step forward.
       Nina Bo'nina Brown.
        Alexis Michelle.
          Sasha Velour.
              Aja.
      Cynthia Lee Fontaine.
          Farrah Moan.
           Peppermint.
             Eureka.
      Ladies, you are safe.
           - (exhales)
          - Thank you.
   - You may leave the stage.
            It's time
  for the judges' critiques...
   Starting with Shea Coulee.
  - Tonight, you are giving me
      this futuristic look
  with hair that hearkens back
         to Barbarella,
   and I'm really feeling it.
   - And the routine you did,
       you were fantastic.
  - She did some amazing flips,
    and I made note of that.
         - You could see
      the humor there, too.
   - As a kid, I wanted to be
  like Dominique Dawes so bad,
  but my parents were like, uh,
you can do that in the backyard.
      We ain't putting you
         in no lessons.
           (all laugh)
    - Thank you, Shea Coulee.
     Next up, Charlie Hides.
     - I didn't remember you
    from the acrobatic thing.
   - I tried to star everyone
that I really thought stood out.
   - Did Charlie have a star?
              - No.
    - But I'll tell you this,
  you seized me on the runway.
   This look is just so good.
          - Thank you.
           - Up next,
        Jaymes Mansfield.
              - Hi.
        - The way you pad
          is glorious.
     You're giving me, like,
       saddlebag and hips.
            It's hot.
        But in the cheer,
      I don't remember you,
      and that's not good.
  I think you like to consider
    yourself a comedy queen,
  but I haven't found anything
     funny coming from you.
           I feel that
   you're unsure of yourself.
     You have to believe it
      in order to sell us.
            - You do
      this airhead shtick,
  and I think if you committed
   all the say, it'd be great.
     And I think that's what
     Michelle's getting at,
        is the confidence
         to commit 100%,
         and I feel like
          it's at 20%.
      - Next up, Valentina.
         - I loved this
      virginal Latina bride
      down to the crossing
          of yourself.
      It was also beautiful
  all the way down to the nude
       and not white shoe.
   But we won't bring that up.
           (all laugh)
     Now, the cheerleading,
      what I loved the most
       was that even when
     the lights weren't on,
   I was watching you, and you
    were fully in character.
     And it just--it was so,
       like, "SNL" moment.
        - I found myself
        looking for you.
   You're like a drug dealer.
   You gave me a little dose.
         I wanted more.
           (all laugh)
    Keep it up, or as you say
          in Spanish--
     I don't know how you--
  I don't know how to say that.
           (all laugh)
   - Next up, Trinity Taylor.
            - You had
     the toughest job of all
     as the ultimate flier,
  and you were so fun to watch.
          - And I think
    this outfit's fantastic.
         Beyond Mugler.
          - Thank you.
     - Up next, Kimora Blac.
     - What stood out to me
     was the wig you had on,
 but you didn't really stand out
          athletically.
     - And that's not good.
  - Tonight, probably my least
     favorite on the runway.
       If I looked at you,
     I'd automatically think
         nautical theme.
  I wish the gloves were white
     and the bra was white.
      I know it sounds like
      it's a lot of white,
     but it's a white party.
      - Thank you, ladies.
   I think we've heard enough.
   While you untuck backstage,
        the judges and I
        will deliberate.
     All right, just between
      us squirrel friends,
       what do you think,
   starting with Shea Coulee?
  - I thought she was the best
   in the athletic department,
          and I thought
    she looked great tonight.
       I love that outfit.
   - In terms of star quality,
           she has it.
      But I think she needs
  to have some kind of padding.
        She's got thighs,
   but she ain't got no booty.
   - All right. Let's move on
        to Charlie Hides.
  - In the cheerleading thing,
  she had this great character
            of Boozy.
 You, out of everybody, Charlie,
 could've taken it all the way.
          - But Charlie
        looked beautiful,
 certainly carried herself well
         on the runway.
   - I'm eager to see what she
 pulls out of her suitcase next,
       but she better pull
      personality out, too.
       - Jaymes Mansfield.
    - Listen, you got a name
     like Jaymes Mansfield,
       you better deliver.
        - I used to watch
        "The Match Game,"
    and Jayne Mansfield would
     come on every so often
        and had a wiggle
          in her walk.
     Jaymes needs more voom
         in his vah-vah.
 - She wants to portray herself
   as this comedic character,
       when I don't think
        that character's
    completely realized yet.
     - Jaymes' audition tape
     was so funny, I got it.
    I understood the shtick.
  But I think that since she's
    been in this competition
      with the other girls,
        she's thrown off.
             - Yeah.
          - Valentina.
      - Valentina, rrrrrrr.
           (all laugh)
        As a cheerleader,
      she really stood out
  with her facial expressions.
        She just made you
           notice her.
     - And I thought she was
    the best dressed tonight.
   I thought she was stunning.
  - Michelle, you did clock her
       on her nude shoes.
          - I'm sorry,
  I just couldn't let that go,
         because she was
    so flawless head to toe,
      why wouldn't she put
        a white shoe on?
       Why would she throw
         a nude clunker?
 - Well, maybe she was thinking
  something old, something new,
       something borrowed,
         something nude.
           (all laugh)
       - Someone you blew.
           (all laugh)
        - Trinity Taylor.
           - I thought
    it was really impressive
       how both characters
   were completely different.
           I wouldn't
      have recognized her.
- Tonight on the runway, though,
   it wasn't my favorite thing
    'cause we've kind of seen
  a lot of this over the years.
           - I thought
      it was very original.
      - Space age fashion,
   I mean, that's total B-52.
           I adore it.
         - Kimora Blac.
     - I didn't remember her
      from the competition,
         and that wasn't
       my favorite outfit.
           - I thought
        she was a newbie.
      - I know why you got
        that impression,
       because she paired
     so many different looks
       onto that one look.
            - Right.
     - Where someone who's a
seasoned prostitute would have--
     would have just chosen
        the nautical hat.
    It actually accented her
   inability to tell a story.
       - She's got so much
         going for her,
  the look, the face, the body,
    the confidence on stage.
   But in terms of who are you
         as a performer,
          I don't know,
   but I know I want to know.
      - All right. Silence!
     I've made my decision.
      Bring back my girls.
   (RuPaul laughs, bell rings)
         (RuPaul laughs)
     - Welcome back, ladies.
    I've made some decisions.
          Shea Coulee.
          You're safe.
          - Thank you.
       - Jaymes Mansfield.
   On the runway, you gave us
        bombshell floozy,
     but your cheer routine
    was a little too snoozy.
     I'm sorry, my dear, but
   you're up for elimination.
       - It's frustrating.
     What I'm trying to show
  the judges isn't translating,
     and I don't really know
  what else they want from me.
        - Trinity Taylor.
          You're safe.
          - Thank you.
          - Valentina.
     Your cheer engaged us,
     and your bridal runway
      made me say, "I do."
         Sissy-boom-bah,
        you're the winner
    of this week's challenge.
You've won a custom wig wardrobe
      from Rock Star Wigs.
      - Thank you so much.
         - You may join
        the other girls.
         Charlie Hides.
    You scored on the runway,
     but your cheer routine
  did not meet our squad goals.
   Kimora Blac, in the cheer,
        you disappeared.
   And in white, you got read
       for being too blue.
        Charlie Hides...
          You're safe.
     - Thank you very much.
    - Kimora Blac, I'm sorry,
            my dear,
         but you are up
        for elimination.
   Two queens stand before me.
        Prior to tonight,
    you were asked to prepare
     a lip sync performance
         of "Love Shack"
          by the B-52s.
Ladies, this is your last chance
          to impress me
        and save yourself
        from elimination.
      The time has come...
            (thunder)
     To lip sync for your...
          (echo) life!
       - It really starts
           to sink in.
       The pressure's on,
    because I'm performing it
           in front of
      the B-52s themselves.
           - To put me
    on the bottom two first?
       Jaymes, watch out.
          - Good luck.
      And don't fuck it up.
          (music plays)
          - Tin roof...
             rusted.
      (cheers and applause)
            - Ladies,
     I've made my decision.
          Kimora Blac,
        Shante you stay.
          You may join
        the other girls.
           (applause)
        Jaymes Mansfield,
   we're all rooting for you.
        Now sashay away.
        - Thank you. Bye.
           (applause)
        I came in first.
           (all laugh)
   Well, that didn't quite go
  exactly as I hoped it would.
   I wasn't fully representing
  myself, and that's my fault.
         But underneath
    all this glamorous drag,
    I'm still a human being,
           so be kind.
  - Con-drag-ulations, ladies.
          And remember,
   if you can't love yourself,
    how in the hell you gonna
       love somebody else?
        Can I get an amen
           up in here?
           All: Amen!
          - All right.
     Now let the music play!


       <i> - Previously on</i>
    RuPaul's Drag <i> Race...</i>
        We're throwing
    the gayest ball ever!
          - I think
    that the dance element
   is not your comfort zone.
       - To be honest,
 I was not being listened to.
 - I don't think you stood up
     as a leader, though.
         You sort of
    explicitly trust Shea.
       - Actually, no.
       I felt like Shea
   was stepping on my toes
        a little bit.
     - It ain't <i> RuPaul's</i>
  <i> Best Friend Race no more.</i>
         -Peppermint.
  -Your unicorn, it was fun,
        but there was
      a little bagginess
           going on
    in the crotch-al area.
       - Alexis Michelle.
     - I feel if we take
  the bow out of your head,
    I can get that outfit
         at Ricky's.
         - Shea Coulee.
         - It's like
a street style model off duty
         meets couture.
       I hope we share
        the same size.
     - You're the winner
  of this week's challenge.
           [applause]
        - Peppermint,
      shantay you stay.
       Alexis Michelle,
         sashay away.
             - Ooh.
             -Oh.
             -Oh.
    - Our heart is broken
       for our sister.
Alexis really wanted to make it
to the top of this competition.
  Unfortunately, I feel like
      this was her time.
     - "Wishes come true,
          not free.
   You're my sisters always."
      Alexis, we love you.
 -We love you so much, girl.
      -We love you, sis.
        - It feels bad
    coming in the top four
   just having lip synched
         for my life.
         So whatever
    the next challenge is,
        I need to rock
     the shit out of it.
       Congratulations
     to Ms. Shea Coulee!
  - I won four challenges now,
      so come on, Mama Ru.
           Tch-tch.
       Hand it on over.
    - I will say I thought
  this was gonna be my week
  'cause I actually did have
       a rainbow look.
            - Oh!
         [all laugh]
        - [cough cough]
     Shea might have won
       this challenge,
  but I will get that crown.
          [chuckles]
     - We are the top four.
            -Four!
         -All right!
       - Can I just say
     this is the top four
   that I really wished for?
        - Bitch, please.
      Don't get me wrong.
   I love these other girls,
    but I want to make it
      in the top three.
    Somebody needs to go.
         It ain't me.
   Enough talking about it.
    Let's get done, honey.
    - These girls are major
        and all of us
  are hungry for that crown,
   so I may have to resort
       to other means.
I don't know what that means.
           [laughs]
       That sounds shady.
            It did.
      [car engine starts]

       we're skipping.
     - Looks like we have

  I'm really excited about it.
     - How do you all feel
          going into

            -Aah!
       -Yeah, me, too.
  Can we all do Peppermint's

         Final Four.
     [cheers and applause]
   This is your last chance
      to prove to RuPaul
         that you're
     top three material.
     To help you stretch
  your charisma, uniqueness,
       nerve and talent,
    you'll be working with
 the incredible Todrick Hall.
       [gasps and cheers]
           He's back.
           [cheering]
         And he's not
    pussy-footing around.
      First, each of you
  needs to write and record
    an original verse for
 the sickening Season 9 remix
   of RuPaul's <i> Category Is.</i>
     [cheers and laughter]
      Then you'll put on
      your dancing shoes
          and learn
  some killer choreography.
            -Ooh.
            -Ooh.
        - And tomorrow
      on the main stage
       you'll be making
      your all-singing,
         all-dancing
  <i> Category Is </i> world debut.
             - Wow.
      - But you'll have
        one more shot
   to really impress Mama Ru
    when you guest on her
critically-acclaimed podcast,
   <i> RuPaul, What's The Tee?</i>
    <i> with Michelle Visage.</i>
           [cheering]
            #RUTop3"
           Get it?
           R-U? Ru.
             -Oh!
             -Oh!
    - Yeah. As we've seen
         this season,
     anything can happen,
     so don't fuck it up.
            Bye-zee.
            -Bye.
            -Bye.
             -Oh.
-Has anyone done this before?
      - I actually have
   an album out on iTunes.
            - Whoo.
    - What are you ladies
      thinking of doing?
      Singing or rapping
    or, like, spoken word?
    - I think I'm gonna rap.
     - Mine is definitely
         spoken word.
    I don't know how to rap.
           - [laughs]
     - Well, I can't sing,
    so I don't really know
 what you're gonna call this.
       - Barnyard noises?
             - Oh!
         - No, ma'am.
     Don't try it, bitch.
            - Whoo.
       We have to rap,
        dance, write.
       Trinity can't do
     any of those things.
          - Trinity,
     you in danger, girl.
  Well, ladies, wish me luck.
         -Good luck.
     -Good luck, darling.
       - Good luck, girl.
          -Hi, Shea.
        -Hey, Todrick.
     So it's time for me
      to record my verse
 to Ru's single <i> Category Is </i>
      with Todrick Hall.
    - This is Vjuan Allure.
      -Vjuan Allure, hi.
    -He is Ru's producer.
He actually produced the track
       to <i> Category Is.</i>
            - Okay.
     This is the real deal.
    People will be hearing
          this shit.
      I have to nail this.
      - Okay, let's hear
        what you got.
   <i> I own 'em, I got-- </i> Mm.
        - One more time.
   - Just take a deep breath
    and make sure you get
    every single word in.
          - I wrote
   some really fast lyrics,
     you know, a la Twista.
   Like, I'm trying to spit
    that shit like so fast
   so that they know that,
   hey, this girl got game.
          - Okay, cut.
           Just try
   to get me more diction.
    -Okay, I'll eat it up.
 -All right, play the track.
            - Great.
         I got chills.
  You're just a bad ass bitch.
             - Hi.
       -Hello, ladies.
       -Hi, Peppermint.
      - I used to watch
       <i> The RuPaul Show</i>
     with Michelle and Ru,
    and here I am a guest
      on their podcast.
    It's a dream come true.
  - You made it all the way
         to top four?
            - Girl.
   - But, you know, for us,
we see the girls year after year
         and I think
    the biggest challenge
   is for them to get past
their conception of themselves.
           -Mm-hmm.
-Have you been able to do that?
            - Yes.
   Before the competition,
   I really had a hard time
          balancing
     kind of my day life
      and my night life.
- Because I know that you have
 revealed that you are trans.
     You're a trans woman.
         Is that what
     we're talking about?
        Is that what--
            - Yes.
 I mean, a really well known
     and respected queen
    back in New York said,
        oh, you know,
     are you transitioning?
      'Cause if you are,
      I'll support you.
           But then
    she immediately said,
         but you know
      you'll never work
  in the gay community again
       as a drag queen.
     - But that's not true.
  - I see that now, but that
  scared the shit out of me.
        -For how long?
           -Years.
           -Years?
  -Until a couple weeks ago.
  I still worked and I still
   continued my transition,
but it made me kind of push them
to opposite ends of the room.
 - You don't ever need to be
       one or another.
  Nobody has to put anybody
    in any kind of a box.
 - I definitely didn't think
      being a drag queen
       and a transwoman
       would ever mix.
           And now,
    after this experience,
 I know that those two things
         can coexist
     if that's who you are,
      and that's who I am.
- Thank you so much, Peppermint,
     for being so honest.
        You is a marvel.
           - [laughs]
     - I'm ready to hear
        what you got.
            -Okay.
         -Play back.
        - Let's pause.
      Let's cut the track.
 Yeah, take that off, honey,
       get comfortable
        'cause we got
     a lot of work to do.
          - All right.
  - The performance quality
      that needs to be,
      you're at like 35%.
          - [chuckles]
            What?
    I've got to push more.
    - Okay, cut the track.
            Okay.
 I don't think that you need
       to take the note
   as that you need to yell
     into the microphone.
    Relax and just be funny.
       Let's do it again.
         Oh, I just--
      - Let's go again.
         - Was I off?
    - You were off, yeah.
      Just tap your foot
     and get that rhythm
       on fleek, okay?
   - Right. Okay, all right.
            -Yeah.
            -Good.
  You're saying "the talent
      I've got, honey,"
     in that line, so...
           - Right.
         Gotta show.
       -Yeah, show us.
    Show us that you got it.
        You [mumbles]
       ain't me, but...
       I am freaking out.
   I have to get it together
       or all this work
   is gonna be for nothing.
         <i> - Coming up...</i>
    - One, two, three, four.
    Down, down, turn, stick.
         - Oh, my gosh.
      - Sasha can't dance.
          - [exhales]
  [RuPaul laughs, bell rings]
        - Oh, my God,
       look who's here.
-Hello, you beautiful legends.
             -Hi.
      - It's time to do
the <i> What's The Tee? </i> podcast
    with Ru and Michelle.
      I'm really excited
  to get to spend some time
    hanging out with them.
 - When you look at yourself
     in this competition,
    what were your missteps?
      - The biggest was
   how I tackled <i> 9021-Ho.</i>
      I thought I could
   think my way into humor.
             - Hmm.
       - But turns out,
  that doesn't work so well.
             - No.
       - And what about
     in life in general?
    - I think a lot about
 my relationship with my mom.
  She passed away last year,
       and I feel like
  there were a lot of missed
opportunities for us to connect.
         I'm not sure
  she ever really got to see
       the type of drag
      that I believe in.
  - But she knew you did drag.
  - She knew I did drag, but
I could have shared it with her.
        -Included her.
            -Yeah.
      My mom was always
     a little bit unsure
   about why I was doing drag
    because she didn't see
  how it could be a career.
    But she was interested.
    Especially in the last
  couple months of her life,
    she wanted nothing more
  than to see what direction
  my life was going to take,
  and I didn't really open up.
  I think all the time about
how it must have felt for her
  feeling like she was going
   to miss out on so much.
  That loss made me realize
the importance of opening up.
  My dad has fallen in love
          with drag.
          Papa Velour.
        -Papa Velour.
        -Papa Velour.
     - That's what people
       always call him.
          [all laugh]
      - Well, thank you,
        Sasha Velour,
       and give my love
       to your father.
           - I will.
    -But before you go...
            -Yes.
   -We have a parting gift.
             -Oh.
         - What is it?
      - Today's podcast
is sponsored by Squatty Potty.
   Best poop of your life,
            kiddo.
         Guaranteed.
     - Thank you so much.
 You know, I'll write a whole
  philosophy piece about it.
          [all laugh]
        - Hey, Todrick.
       -How you doin'?
    -I'm doin' good, baby.
       -We're twinning.
             -Ow!
             - Ow.
       - I love to sing,
        I love to rap,
    and I love to perform,
      and that's exactly
   what this challenge is.
         I'm gonna win.
     - Let's just dive in.
             Sh...
   - Let's do it, Peppermint,
 'cause there's nothing worse
 than messing up a lip synch,
   than messing a lip synch
       that you wrote.
             - Aah.
       - Cut the track.
Whatever you're doing right now,
   take that and run with it,
    'cause that is, like,
      your personality.
         - I love it.
          That's it.
      - Fricka-fricka-ree.
      - How are you guys?
          - Hi, Shea.
  - Shake a leg, Shea Coulee.
  Now, somebody told me you
 were teased a lot as a kid.
  - Yes. Where we lived was
 a mostly white neighborhood,
      and so I was teased
    because I was the only
     black kid, you know.
    They'd call me Blackie.
           And then
     I would go to church
     and then they would
        make fun of me
      because they said
      I spoke too white.
 So I really didn't feel like
 I belonged much of anywhere.
      And it really took
          doing drag
      to become stronger
     and more confident.
         It's my armor.
       - When you went
       to this church,
       did you get into
   the spirit of the Lord?
       - Oh, girl, yeah.
       I used to shout
 and I used to buck and jive
    and throw it all around.
  -Did you speak in tongues?
          -Oh, yes.
     Boon shaka-la-la-la,
halla-la-la-la, halla-la-la-la.
          [all laugh]
    - So it's shah la-la...
           -Mm-hmm.
           -Boom...
       -Boom-boom kah.
           -Uh-huh.
 - Kah-kah-kah, kah-kah-kah,
      kah-kah-kah, kah.
             - Yes.
        - I'm familiar
        with that one.
       I know that one.
    That was at my church.
       - Yeah. [laughs]
         - I love it.
            -Yes.
        -Hey, listen,
         we actually
 have a parting gift for you.
      - It's going to be
       your very own--
     - Oh, my God, shut up!
            - Yes.
       - The Squatty--
            -Yes!
            -Yes!
      -Oh, my goodness.
       -That's for you.
     Poop in good health.
      - Thank you, guys.
           - Bye-ee.
            -Bye.
            -Bye.
      - That bitch knew
   what Squatty Potty was.
         - Hell, yes.
 Squatty Potty ain't no joke.
          - I love it.
      - Okay. I am just
   gonna be real with you.
           I'm not
  all the way sold on this.
  For somebody who's coming up
        for the finale
   of <i> RuPaul's Drag Race,</i>
       it just doesn't
        seem powerful.
     You're a drag queen.
    You know what I mean?
  I feel like it needs to be--
     - But I'm this kind
   of drag queen, Todrick.
- I'm not saying you need to be,
  like, popping your tongue
        and giving us
       Alyssa Edwards,
        but right now,
     it just sounds like
     you're saying lines
      into a voicemail.
           - Oh, God.
        It's important
       to show Todrick
       I can be a star
     and still be myself.
       - Play the track.
          - Awesome.
  How'd you feel about that?
          - Better.
       You were right.
           - [laughs]
      - Now, you're from
     Birmingham, Alabama,
     and you were raised
    by your grandparents.
            - I was.
     - What do they think
   about you as a showgirl?
        - I never told
       my grandfather,
 although I think he probably
    found a couple of wigs
      under a towel once
   and didn't say nothing.
          -[laughs]
       -Uh-huh, uh-huh.
     - Now, my grandmother,
  she had a really hard time
      with me being gay.
     And towards the end
  we had a big falling out,
         even though
  I was taking care of her.
    - Was the falling out
   over your homosexuality?
           -It was.
        -Or the drag?
  - It was over me being gay.
We got into a really big fight
      before she passed,
        and I told her
      that I hated her.
      I didn't mean that,
   but it's something that
haunts me, like, still today.
    Like, I just wish that
  wouldn't have been, like,
    one of the last things
         I told her.
            - Right.
       - I don't know.
          I just...
     There's a lot about
the last few months of her life
      that I just don't
      have closure with.
         Like, I just--
   I wish there would have
   been more conversations.
         I wish there
  would have been more time.
       I can't go back
        and be, like,
  I'm sorry that I said that
    'cause she's not here.
       - Yeah. My guess
  is that if she were here,
     she would forgive you.
          - I hope so.
       - No, she would
   definitely forgive you.
        She would say,
  I am so proud of my baby.
        - She sounded
       just like that.
           - [laughs]
     - I didn't want her
        to ever think
that I really didn't love her,
        because I do.
   She was the best parent
    I could have ever had.
     - There are my queens.
       How y'all doin'?
            - Hey.
  - Good work earlier today,
      but the challenge
   is just about to really
    get started right now.
      It's time to learn
      your choreography
     for the performance
          tomorrow.
   My goal is to challenge
     every single person
           based on
     their own skill set.
   I really want to push them
     because that's what
  this competition is about.
    Let's go, Peppermint.
          You ready?
      - All right, baby,
          I'm ready.
      - So I want to see
   if you can sit like this
   so they can go like that.
      - This performance
  determines the top three.
       I cannot afford
to drop the ball on this one.
   -Bring it to the runway.
         -Two, three.
        - Cut, cut, cut.
        - Let's do this.
       - Let's try that
        from the top.
    Five, six, seven, walk.
          Bring Keith.
         Put her down.
      Left, right, left.
         Right, left.
         Awesome. Cool.
        Next up, Sasha.
      Okay, can you just
        do fast walks?
  Gah-gah-gah, gah-gah-gah,
      gah-gah-gah, boom.
     And then, walk, walk,
    five, six, seven, fall.
          -[exhales]
       -Can we try it?
            - Sure.
  - What is Todrick thinking?
       Sasha can't dance.
    - One, two, three, four.
      Down, down, turn,
         six, seven.
         - Oh, my gosh.
 - Dun-dun-dun, dun-dun-dun,
      dun-dun-dun, boom.
      This should be fast.
  Gah-gah-gah, gah-gah-gah,
      gah-gah-gah, boom.
      - I'll do my best.
            Sorry.
       - Let's go back.
   Five, six, seven, eight.
  - I'm really--I'm honestly
       trying my best.
       I want to nail it,
but I just maybe won't get it,
      like, immediately.
 - But do you feel confident
that you can do this on stage?
     - I do feel confident.
   - Because if you don't,
   you should tell me now.
   - I feel like I can do it,
  but it is a huge challenge
   that I want to rise to.
           - Good.
     I like to hear that.
  - Girl. Sasha is up there
  looking like she's shook.
         <i> - Coming up...</i>
   - She's just been up here.
      - I'm a huge fan.
  She's got the real goods.
           - Oh, no.
  [RuPaul laughs, bell rings]
         - All right.
  Let's move on to Trinity.
      - We're rehearsing
       our choreography
      for our main stage
         performance
       of <i> Category Is </i>
      with Todrick Hall.
          - You ready?
          - I mean,
    I'm gonna have to be.
           - [laughs]
   - I am extremely nervous.
- So can you go, what category
     are we on right now?
  - What category are we on
     ri--oh, wait, wait.
   Yeah, it's in a--okay, so.
       What category--
   - What category are we--
       - What category
     are we on right now?
       - What category
     are we on right now?
      - What dance move
       is coming next?
       - What category
     are we on right now?
    - Okay. I can get it,
but it's gonna take practice.
   - The problem with Trinity
   is that her rhythm game
     is a little delayed.
    I feel like I'm always
    watching her on Skype.
            Okay.
   Let's try it with music.
      - Oh, my gosh. Okay.
         - Five, six,
      bring it, Trinity.
  - Mayday, Mayday, Mayday,
       Mayday, Mayday!
 I may not have it right now,
but I promise I will have it.
         - But people
    have said that before.
- If I can't do it, that means,
  well, girl, I can't dance.
     - Then you might not
     be in the top three.
         - I deserve
      to make top three.
    I've worked my ass off
          for this.
  I've got to figure this out.
   - Shea Coulee, you ready?
       - Mm-hmm. Yeah.
           [laughs]
  - What is this giggle about?
 - You're throwing some real
       shit out today.
          [both laugh]
  - Well, this is Season 9.
    We got to step it up.
    And I'm gonna bring it
      real hard for you
   because I know you dance
        all the time.
          - Mm-hmm.
           - Okay?
         Can you do,
      like, a pirouette?
           -Mm-hmm.
     -A double pirouette?
           -Mm-hmm.
     -A triple pirouette?
        -I could try.
        -Let's see it.
      - Work, bitch, okay.
    - One, two, three, four,
    five, six, seven, eight.
        How'd you do?
        - I did well.
     - She did it. Damn it.
    Shea is gonna continue
     to slay the judges.
         Yay for Shea.
   - Five, six, seven, eight.
            - Bitch.
  Like, I'm gonna have to do
     some showgirl shit.
     Throw some pearls down
    so she can, like, fall
      and bust her face.
          -Awesome.
         -All right.
          - Great job.
        [RuPaul laughs]
           And what?
 - Welcome to the main stage
   of <i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
   Tonight, it's just family.
          This week,
   we challenged our queens
      to prove they are
     top three material.
    And now they're ready
      to kick things off
     with the world debut
       of <i> Category Is</i>
    with original material
 by the recording sensations
   Peppermint, Sasha, Shea
         and Trinity.
   Or as I like to call them,
         Seduction 2,
      Electric Boogaloo.
          [all laugh]
          Gentlemen,
     start your engines,
  and may the best woman win.
        - Category is,
   bring it to the runway.
      Category is stars,
   statements and legends.
        10s, 10s, 10s
      across the board.
   Deejay, start the music.
        Category is...
        Category is...
              Aah!
          [all laugh]
 - Dah-dah-dah, dah-dah-dah,
  dah-dah-dah, dah-dah-dah,
  dah-dah-dah, dah-dah-dah,
  dah-dah-dah, dah-dah-dah,
      dah-dah-dah, pom.
       - Category is...
       - What category
     are we on right now?
         What category
     are we on right now?
        What category
     are we on right now?
    Wh-wh-wh-what category?
          Bring it.
        Category is...
          - Bring it
    to the runway, runway.
     Run--run--r-r-runway.
   Bring it to the runway.
          Oh, work.
     Run--run--r-r-runway.
   Bring it to the runway.
   Bring it to the runway.
      Bring it to the--
      bring it to the--
     bring it to the runway
     Bring it to the runway.
           Runway,
    run--run--r-r-runway.
   Bring it to the runway.
   Bring it to the runway.
      Bring it to the--
      bring it to the--
     bring it to the runway
       - Oh, my goodness.
             Wow!
          [applause]
 - This is the best season of
<i>Dancing with the Stars </i> ever.
          [all laugh]
         <i> - Coming up...</i>
   - Ladies, it's time for
  your final four critique.
  [RuPaul laughs, bell rings]
        - Category is...
         - Final Four
    Eleganza Extravaganza.
     First up, Peppermint.
        Well, I declare.
   - The first lady of drag.
  - I am giving you ultimate
 18th century luxuriousness.
        I look gorgeous.
     Hell, we can cancel
       the whole thing
  and just give me the crown
          right now.
    - As God is my witness,
      I will never walk
      this runway again.
         Sasha Velour.
      - Crown never felt
          this good.
             - Yes.
       - Well, I think
   she's blooming gorgeous.
             - Yes.
  - This is my pretty in pink,
    but it has a distinct
       Velourian twist.
      There is a crown,
       leather gloves.
   I'm angry and ferocious
        and beautiful
    and everything at once
       that defines me.
         - I own 51%
       of this kingdom.
       [Michelle laughs]
       - Now I'm going
     to wash the dishes.
        Leave me alone.
    - Voulez, Shea Coulee,
          avec moi.
       Bustier, you slay.
     - My look is Balmain
meets Bob Mackie meets Beyonce.
        It's something
      that you would see
   at Madison Square Garden,
    and I don't doubt that
 your girl can make it there.
     - It's like Beyonce
   and a smurf had a baby.
        - Smurf-once.
         [all laugh]
   - Now, I love this look,
  but--and it's a big butt.
          [all laugh]
        Trinity Taylor.
      - Oh, I hate when
  I fall asleep on the bus.
          You know?
         [all laugh]
       - Going through
      this competition,
         I've claimed
    to be a pageant girl,
       and yet to give
  a sickening pageant gown.
      So I am giving them
every ounce of Trinity Taylor
    glamour-puss as I can.
     - Oh, and she's back
      on the chain gang.
         - Yes, she is.
         - Back chains?
          - That way.
   - Welcome, my gorgeous,
       gorgeous girls.
This show is like a GPS system
for many of our young viewers
   as they try to navigate
         their lives,
     which is why I think
      it's so important
   to ask you this question.
             -Aw.
             -Oh.
- Peppermint, you've provided us
   with a childhood photo.
  If you could turn back time,
     what words of wisdom
       would you share
          with your
     four-year-old self?
    - Despite...everything
 you hear from other people,
    everything you feel...
            [sobs]
     everything you feel
   on the inside is right.
      And please...[sobs]
          don't wait.
   Don't wait to express it.
   Don't wait to express it,
      because the moment
      you realize that,
      everyone else will.
     - That's beautiful.
          Thank you.
        Sasha Velour,
this is you at five years old.
      Now, if you could
       turn back time,
what words of wisdom would you
 share with little Alexander?
       - Little Sashinka,
 you think a lot of negative
    things about yourself:
that you are strange-looking,
       too fem, weird.
     And I want to tell you
      that those things
   are all completely true.
          [all laugh]
       And you need to
    stop running from them
 because those are the things
    that make you amazing.
      And one more thing.
    Be good to your mother,
  because there is less time
     than you would want,
        and she deserves
  to see the beautiful queen
        that you are.
  - I'd like to think she's
   watching you right now.
       Thank you, Sasha.
          Shea Coulee.
           - [laughs]
        - This is you
     at three years old.
  What words of wisdom would
 you share with little Jaren?
- Get your head out of the TV
         for a second
  'cause I want to tell you
        you are loved.
  And there are some things
that you are going to experience
       that I wish that
  I could protect you from,
     but those hardships
 make you into the individual
  that's standing here today.
    And I want to thank you.
   Even when I didn't think
that we could do it, you did.
    And I'm so proud of us.
       - Thank you, Shea.
          - Thank you.
       - Trinity Taylor.
          [all laugh]
         This is you
     at eight years old.
  What words of wisdom would
 you share with little Ryan?
      - As you get older,
     things are gonna get
     really bad for you.
           [sniffles]
You're gonna go through a lot
of hardships with your family,
   and people are gonna die
 and they're gonna get sick.
    But you're gonna find
    something very special
   that changes your life,
      and that is drag.
Know that all the things that
 you've been through in life
      are gonna make you
  into a very strong person.
          - Thank you.
         <i> - Coming up...</i>
     - One final question.
   Why should you, and not
  one of your fellow queens,
     be crowned America's
     next drag superstar?
  [RuPaul laughs, bell rings]
   - Ladies, it's time for
  your Final Four critique,
   starting with Peppermint.
- When there are hot young guys
    in harnesses dancing,
       I get distracted.
    Look, a bird, abs, yay.
    But you kept the focus
       the entire time.
 - The lyrics were hilarious,
      were uniquely you.
   You have all the goods,
      and you delivered.
- And I think on this journey,
 as the competition went on,
  I feel like you've become
  more and more of yourself.
  - And thank you for always
   coming out with charisma
    and making us all smile.
- What, she gets no uniqueness,
      nerve and talent?
         - I might be
    spelling a word here.
          [all laugh]
    - Up next, Sasha Velour.
    - We're gonna give you
          uniqueness
           because
    that is what you are.
         And tonight,
   from the start of, like,
      the Vincent Price
      "Thriller" moment
      to your lip synch
      and choreography,
        it was so Sasha.
   - Throughout your journey,
      your runway looks
      have been genius,
   artistic fashion moments.
   You're always innovative.
      - And you managed
    to be consistently you
     and flexible enough
to succeed in this competition.
     I've been impressed
       the entire time.
    - Up next, Shea Coulee.
           - Shea,
   it do take nerve, honey.
    Whether it's Grandrea
  Zuckerwoman or Blac Chyna,
       you always went
     all the way with it,
         and tonight
      was no exception.
      - Your performance
     felt the most cool.
  You really captured what's
happening in music right now.
       - And this look,
   you're kind of giving us
  that, like, Beyonce glamour.
         And you have
      a sense of humor.
           I think
   that's a great package,
      one that's really
        hard to beat.
   - Up next, Trinity Taylor.
      - My good, gay gods.
       Trinity, this is
       my favorite look
  you've ever turned tonight.
          - Thank you.
        - And who knew
   that Trinity was funny?
   - The mom in "9021-Ho,"
        it was genius.
   The nun was unbelievable.
      Sister Mary Koont,
         I loved it.
        - Talent, the T,
         that's what
   I'm giving you, Trinity,
 because you have done things
in this competition talent wise
       you didn't know
       you had in you.
        - I'm finally
      figuring this out.
         C-U-N-Trinity.
       - Yes! Thank you.
  - I'd like to buy a vowel,
       Michelle Visage.
   - I told you I had a plan.
          [all laugh]
     - One final question.
    Why should you and not
  one of your fellow queens
     be crowned America's
     next drag superstar?
   Starting with Peppermint.
  - I'd like to take a page
  from our drag foremothers
     way back at Stonewall
     and spread a message
      of love and light.
  I think we have to connect
      with our community
  and people outside of what
we would consider our community.
         As America's
     next drag superstar,
     it will be important
      for me to do that.
          - Thank you.
        - Thank you, Ru.
       - Sasha Velour,
        same question.
     - The future of drag,
   to stand up and carry on
       your legacy, Ru,
      we have to be able
     to do something new.
        The new thing
       is going to seem
       a little strange
     and a little weird,
and the new thing is definitely
 gonna walk in with a scream,
        and that is me.
     - Thank you, Sasha.
         Shea Coulee.
        - I committed.
         I gave 110%.
  And even though I stumbled,
          more than
    any of my competitors,
     I succeeded the most.
      That is the making
       of a superstar.
         I would want
   to carry on your legacy
       and be America's
     next drag superstar.
       - Thank you, Shea.
        Trinity Taylor.
  - Out of every contestant,
     I've grown the most
 not just as an entertainer,
       but as a person.
  I may have had some downs,
   but I've tried so hard,
      through everything
  I've ever done in my life,
   to make something better
         for myself.
   I've never had stability,
          and being
   the next drag superstar
           would be
    a huge weight lifted,
       and I deserve it.
     - Thank you, Trinity.
          - Thank you.
      - Thank you, ladies.
        Now, while you
      untuck backstage,
       the judges and I
       will deliberate.
      [car engine starts]
 All right, now just between
        us four tops,
          let's talk
     about the top four.
             -Mm.
         -Peppermint.
   - Peppermint is a classic.
     She hits her marks.
  She delivers her moments.
  She's a Jane of all trades.
     - She's got that thing
      that is so crucial
for anybody in show business.
   She's got the likeability,
  and if she won the title,
 that's gonna serve her well.
        - Sasha Velour.
       - I'm a huge fan
  because she dissects drag,
    and then reinvents it
in her own very artistic way.
 - Yeah, and we do know what
a Sasha look and act will be.
        - And I liked
     what she had to say
  about the drag of the future
      is not going to be
     what we're used to.
    - I would love to see
    what someone like her
   could do with that crown.
         - Shea Coulee.
  - She's a great entertainer.
    She's a great dancer.
    She's a great actress.
     - And every look was
 pretty great on the runway.
     - With the exception
         of a stumble
   in the makeover challenge,
    she's just been up here.
- She absolutely proved herself
      every single time.
     You should call her
     the postman of drag.
         She delivered.
       - Trinity Taylor.
  - When this first started,
  we just saw pageant girl,
and as this contest progressed,
         so did she.
         - She needed
       these challenges
      to say, no, you're
    actually really funny.
 - And think about how funny
   Stanky the Starfish was.
       - It was amazing.
- And tonight, with her dance,
      she was hilarious.
  - That's my favorite thing
   about this competition,
       when the queens
     surprise themselves.
- I feel like Trinity has made
the biggest leap in my opinion.
    - I'd love to see her
      in the top three.
            - Yeah.
      - Well, this isn't
        gonna be easy.
            Silence.
     I've made my decision.
      Bring back my girls.
  [RuPaul laughs, bell rings]
    - Welcome back, ladies.
        All season long,
        you've worked
  your big ol' booties off,
       and each of you
     has more than earned
   your spot on this stage
           tonight.
     The time has come...
          [thunder]
      for you to lip synch
    [echoing] for your life.
          Good luck
    and don't fuck it up.
       <i> - I have to be</i>
      <i> in the top three.</i>
          <i> I brought</i>
 <i> as much grace and humility</i>
       <i> as I did talent</i>
      <i> and personality.</i>
    Sounds like America's
  next drag superstar to me.
        <i> - Kitty girl,</i>
 <i> work that high-end tights.</i>
      <i> - I am determined</i>
   <i> to take over the world</i>
   <i> with my crazy, strange</i>
       <i> Velourian drag,</i>
         <i> and I'm not</i>
  <i> going to be stopped now.</i>
      <i> I have to make it</i>
      <i> to the top three.</i>
        I have to win.
           [laughs]
        <i> - I've worked</i>
    <i> my entire adult life</i>
     <i> to build the brand</i>
     <i> of Trinity Taylor.</i>
  <i> I deserve to be America's</i>
    <i> next drag superstar,</i>
        <i> so I'm coming</i>
   <i> for that crown, ladies.</i>
            Back up.
   <i> - It's about the drive</i>
        <i> and the nerve</i>
   <i> and the desire to win.</i>
     <i> I'm the total package.</i>
    <i> If y'all placing bets</i>
         <i> on anybody,</i>
   you want to throw $5.00
         down on me.
        [RuPaul laughs]
           [applause]
          - Ladies,
    I've made my decision.
    Tonight, I've decided...
        To eliminate...
            No one.
       All four of you
      are moving forward
     to the grand finale
   of "RuPaul's Drag Race."
   How you like them apples?
     -I love them, girl.
    -Ooh, they real sweet.
     - My top four queens,
           the race
   has never been so close.
    And now I want to hear
     from our super fans.
       Who do you think
      should be crowned
          America's
     next drag superstar?
   Are you #TeamPeppermint...
         #TeamSasha...
          #TeamShea...
        or #TeamTrinity?
    Let your voice be heard.
    Because Mama Ru wil be
         #listening.
        Now, remember,
 if you can't love yourself,
       how in the hell
you gonna love somebody else?
      Can I get an amen
         up in here?
            -Amen!
            -Amen!
   - Can I get a whoop-whoop?
        -Whoop-whoop!
        -Whoop-whoop!
    - Can I get a she done
    already done had hers?
    All: She done already
        done had hers.
         - All right.
   Now let the music play.


        <i> - Previously on</i>
      RuPaul's Drag Race...
     - You'll be starring in
   "Kardashian: The Musical."
      [cheers and screams]
  - Playing the part of Khloe,
       Nina Bo'nina Brown.
        - Really, bitch?
        - I landed wrong
    and my knee just popped.
        Now it's hurting,
   so I have to use crutches.
    And I break the internet
        every other day.
     - Cynthia Lee Fontaine.
           - When it's
       a lip sync number,
           you kind of
     have to know the words.
         - Farrah Moan.
          - It was just
       very underwhelming.
         - Shea Coulee.
  - You stole the entire show.
- Shea Coulee, you're the winner
    of this week's challenge.
  Eureka, please step forward.
       We've been in touch
        with the doctor.
       I cannot allow you
 to continue in the competition.
            - [sobs]
  - You have an open invitation
     to return next season.
    But for now, sashay away.
    - Oh, that was something.
    - Eureka, Eureka, honey.
         - "Well, shit,
         Biggie is out,
        "but this is not
         the last of me.
         Love, Eureka."
    - Eureka's gone, and I'm
     gonna miss her so much.
She was instantly my best friend
         since day one.
           I am broke.
    - May I just say congrats
to our winner, Miss Shea Coulee.
              -Yes.
             -Yeah.
             - Shea.
   - Shea nailed Black Chyna.
         But the judges
      loved my Kris Jenner.
 Had I nailed my runway harder,
  I would have been the winner.
      - Watching Eureka go
         just reminds us
    that none of us are safe.
            -Uh-huh.
        -That's so true.
     - My ankle was hurting,
 but it magically feels better.
           [all laugh]
      - Nina, do you really
        want to be here?
             - Ooh!
       - Because it feels
         like you don't.
             - How?
    - Every week, when you're
  getting ready in the mirror,
    when we're at rehearsals,
        you're just like,
     I'm over it and I don't
        want to do this.
             -Whoo.
         -First of all,
        I'm getting ready
           over there.
  You're over there, so you're
 not watching me in the mirror.
  - I'm not convinced that Nina
        wants to be here.
   She has this big conspiracy
          that everyone
     wants to see her fail,
     and I'm so tired of it.
        You didn't even--
       - Hold on, hold on.
         La, la, la, la.
         You don't know.
        - I'm not trying
        to come for you--
       - It feels like it.
          Wait, bitch.
          If I'm down,
       I'm down on myself.
    - I know that though Nina
       struggles sometimes
      with her confidence,
    she does want to be here.
        - I just want you
     to believe in yourself
        as much as RuPaul
        believes in you.
       - Right, and put it
       on the line. Right.
  - Because when I was looking
 at her looking into your eyes,
   I wish that she had looked
        at me in my eyes
   the way that she had looked
   at you in yours, you know.
         - I apologize,
     'cause I know right now
    you're kind of just down
        on what happened.
   So I got black real quick.
           [all laugh]
  - Shea's being a really good
    friend to Nina right now,
    but Nina absolutely needs
     an attitude adjustment.
            In fact,
   it's time to trim the fat:
    Nina, for being negative,
    Farrah for not being able
  to stick out from the bunch,
 and Cynthia for not being able
 to do anything except Cynthia.
      If you don't deliver,
       you should go home.

       I said X-specially.
      That is so Brooklyn.
        That is so, like,

     - Hello, hello, hello.
           [cheering]
           Hi, ladies.
             - Whoo!
   - Ladies, the time has come
  to separate the basic bitches
   from the fierce-ass queens.
           [all laugh]
             - Yes.
      - Because, honey, for
   this week's maxi challenge,
       we gonna be playing
 some "Snatch Game" up in here.
           [cheering]
           #SnatchGame
             -Whoo!
          -I'm excited.
   I've been waiting for this
       since last season.
             Ha-ha!
            Finally!
      - Imitate a celebrity
   and make us laugh out loud
            or else.
         - Let's do it.
      - What you gonna do,
            Trinity?
        - Amanda Lepore.
              -Aah!
              -Aah!
             - Shea?
      - The face, the body,
         Naomi Campbell.
              -Aha!
              -Oh!
      - What are you doing
       for "Snatch Game?"
         - NeNe Leakes.
             - Yes.
    - She's over everything,
     and she has this really
   bitter face, you know. Mmm.
    - That's like completely
    opposite of you, though.
            - I know.
    That'll be the challenge.
 Impersonations aren't something
   that I've ever tried to do,
    but last week, I was able
     to take Britney Spears
           and turn it
      into something great.
       So if I can do that
      with my NeNe Leakes,
       then it's all good.
     - Hello, she-lebrities.
              -Hey!
              -Hey!
           [all laugh]
       Nina Bo'nina Brown
          Nelson Riley.
          - Hey, Rrrru.
      How you doing, baby?
      - How are you doing?
          - I am doing
        a lot better now.
    - Because, listen, child,
        you know, I know
      from where you come.
 It's an ongoing struggle where
 you have to shut up that voice.
       - That voice, yeah.
     It's so easy to attach
       onto the negative.
        I don't know why.
         And the people
      are starting to think
  that I'm playing this victim
   thing, but, no, it's real.
        -It's not an act.
         -That's right.
      - And the only person
   who will lose at it is you.
      But you're talented.
        All of the things
        you come up with,
     that's some real shit.
    That's what got you here.
     - Right. I have so much
     for respect for RuPaul
   'cause I really do not know
    what to do with my life.
        I'm 34 years old,
       I'm still at home,
     and he believes in me.
    So I do not want to make
    that man not proud of me.
     - So who are you doing?
         - [deep voice]
      I am Jasmine Masters
   and I got something to say.
   - Oh, oh, that's brilliant.
        That's hilarious.
         - Do you buy it
         or you rent it?
       - I'm rent to own.
          - Okay, girl.
         - She's funny.
     I love Jasmine Masters.
      You better bring it,
  because we don't want to see
     your dark nemesis come
 and tapping you on the shoulder
 and irk you in the side, okay?
           All right.
       See you out there.
           Hi, Sasha.
          - Hi, RuPaul.
        -I see a top hat.
            -Mm-hmm.
        -A men's jacket.
            -Mm-hmm.
       - I'm gonna go with
        Marlene Dietrich?
    -You got it on the nose.
          -Oh, really?
   Now, Germans aren't really
     known for being funny.
     How are you gonna make
     Marlene Dietrich funny?
    - Honestly, I don't think
 I'm known for being very funny.
           - What were
       your other choices?
       - I had considered
         Judith Butler,
         the third wave
      feminist philosopher.
  - Can you do a little bit of
 Judith Butler right now for me?
      - Sure, let's do it.
      - Now, Judith Butler,
   should I have the meatloaf
   or the hot dog at the diner
        down the street?
       - I'm understanding
      that in this example,
   hot dog actually stands in
 as a kind of social construct,
    a metaphor, if you will,
      for the idea of a man
         sort of center
     of his phallic primacy.
     - I'm glad you're doing
        Marlene Dietrich.
  - [laughs] I'm a very serious
       and intense person.
      But I do crack jokes
         in my own way.
     - Can't wait to see you
           out there.
         - So I'm hoping
     I can tap into that...
             charm.
         <i> - Coming up...</i>
      Mama, it's come true!
          - Damn, girl.
   [RuPaul laughs, bell rings]
         [RuPaul laughs]
           - It's time
      for a "Snatch Game."
      You have to be funny,
         you have to be
       quick on your feet,
          and you have
        to make Ru laugh.
    - Well, Alexis Michelle.
          - Hi, RuPaul.
          - Now, okay,
        I'm gonna guess.
       Is it Joyce DeWitt?
    - It's not Joyce DeWitt.
           It's Liza!
            [laughs]
            -Finally.
            -Finally.
     - Mama, it's come true!
          [both laugh]
    So how are you gonna make
     this Liza come to life?
             Because
    a lot of people do Liza.
              -Yes.
  -A lot of eyes will be on you
   to do all the right moves.
    - She's one of my biggest
       drag inspirations,
         so I want this
    to be done with respect.
    This is a loving tribute.
       - Well, that's all
         well and nice,
         but, you know,
   you got to make her funny.
             - Yes.
       I have to make sure
   that I am bringing it hard.
     I have to let them see
           [whispers]
        that I'm a star.
             - Well,
      Cynthia Lee Fontaine.
        I see a tank top
     and a brown lace front.
          Are you doing
         Sofia Vergara?
             - Yes!
   - That's a great character
            for you.
     - Thank you. I've been
     studying Sofia Vergara
      for almost two years.
   I think it's a good choice
     because we have accent.
       I'm gonna slay her.
 - Can you give me just a touch
        of Sofia Vergara?
      - [speaking Spanish]
         Why you ask me
    that question right now?
      I need more<i> fornido.</i>
      Do you have<i> fornido?</i>
        I can't give you
    all this count right now.
     - Okay, so when are you
   going to start doing Sofia?
              - Oh.
             - Ooh.
           Damn, girl.
            - I think
  it's going to be interesting
          to watch you
     make her come to life.
          - Thank you.
     Thank you, Mama RuPaul.
     - All right, bye, Cucu.
       All right, ladies,
          gather round.
Now, in a few moments, you'll be
     shooting "Snatch Game."
   And tomorrow on the runway,
       the category is...
    Night of 1,000 Madonnas,
           Part Deux.
      [cheers and applause]
             - Whoo!
     We get to actually redo
       the Madonna runway
      that was an epic fail
          last season.
         Sorry, ladies.
      - One word of advice.
    Kimono she better don't.
     [laughter and applause]
    - Thank you, Mama RuPaul.
   - Welcome to "Snatch Game."
   Let's meet our contestants.
    He once got a standing O
      from Elaine Stritch.
       It's Denis O'Hare.
       Our next contestant
     is allergic to mustard.
        Keep that hot dog
       away from my face.
   Say hello to Candis Cayne.
          Are you ready
      to snatch the stars?
              -Yes.
           -Let's go.
       - Good. Let's give
     a big game show welcome
      to downtown superstar
         Amanda Lepore.
         - Hi, everyone.
       - Oh, my goodness.
     You are such a gorgeous
      international vixen.
        How do you do it?
   - These lips have secrets.
        - I bet they do.
     Next up, the legendary
    Marlene Dietrich is here.
       - Thank you so much
     for having me, RuPaul,
       on your<i> Drag Race.</i>
        I see you're also
         wearing a suit.
      -I'm wearing a suit.
 -You know, when I wear a suit,
      people say, Marlene,
       are you a lesbian?
       And I look at them
         and I say, yes.
           [laughing]
   - All right. We've got some
     <i> Drag</i> Race alumni here.
     Alyssa Edwards is here.
   -For your consideration...
            -Uh-huh.
   - My name is Alyssa Edwards
   and this is "Snatch Game."
     - Up next, pop the corn
     and feed the children.
      It's Jasmine Masters,
         another alumni.
    -[deep voice] Hey, bitch.
            -[laughs]
      What brings you back
          to<i> Drag Race?</i>
    -I got something to say.
         -I bet you do.
   Next up, Internet superstar
     Gigi Gorgeous is here.
            -Hi, Ru.
           -Hi, doll.
       You look fantastic.
     Hey, I could really use
  a makeup tip right about now.
     - You know what I say.
       You can never wear
      too much highlighter.
           - Ooh, yes.
         Ring dem bells.
       It's Liza Minnelli
      or is it Lisa Manuli?
            - No, Ru,
       it's Liza with a Z.
           It has a Z.
        - Liza with a Z.
           - With a Z!
      -Yes, Liza with a Z.
           -Yes, yeah.
          - All right.
            Up next,
       we've got Atlanta's
         juiciest peach,
      NeNe Leakes is here.
            - Hi, Ru.
     - How are you and Kenya
             doing?
     - Ru, mm, that bitch--
            - Uh-oh.
         - If her weave
      was on any tighter...
      - What would happen?
     Would her head pop off?
           - Her head
      would explode, bitch.
          - Oh, bloop.
            - Bloop!
             - Okay.
            Next up,
      she was Miss Universe
    for just about a minute.
   Say hello to Miss Colombia.
     Oh, I didn't mean to--
          did I--what?
    - Is that Steve Harvey?!
            - No, no,
      I'm not Steve Harvey.
      No, no, no, darling.
          It's RuPaul.
             I know.
     We just all look alike.
             - Aah!
           - Up next,
     supermodel of the world
         Naomi Campbell
       is up in the house.
         You don't look
         a day over 16.
       - And I don't taste
         a day over 15.
            -[laughs]
              -Yes.
          - All right.
      From "Modern Family,"
         Sofia Vergara.
     - Hola. How you doin',
             RuPaul?
     - How is your husband,
       Joe Mangananganan?
    - You know what, RuPaul?
     You don't have to worry
  about mention that last name,
             because
     I always have problem.
    The only thing is, like,
    when we have a little bit
         of interaction
    or maybe probably sex...
             - Yeah.
    - We don't have to talk.
            It's just
       only body language.
        - Body language,
          darling, yes.
      - And let me tell you
           something.
    These too big, beautiful
   Colombian surgical raisins
     is making happy and hoo
      all the entire night
         trying to look
      for another children.
        - Well, you know,
         she's smiling,
            so I know
      she just told a joke.
     All right. Who's ready
     to play "Snatch Game?"
        - You better make
      Mama Ru laugh, girl,
      'cause if she's not,
  you might be sashaying away.
         <i> - Coming up...</i>
      - If it's not on BET,
    I don't know what it is.
     - I never win anything!
           [all laugh]
   [RuPaul laughs, bell rings]
         [RuPaul laughs]
         - Welcome back
        to "Snatch Game."
        Okay, here we go.
         First question
      is for Denis O'Hare.
             The new
     "American Horror Story"
         is going to be
      the scariest one yet.
         It takes place
     in Lady Bunny's blank.
      All right, pens down.
       Okay, Denis O'Hare.
        - It takes place
           in her wig.
     - In Lady Bunny's wig.
      That's a good answer.
  Let's go to the stars and see
  if you get any matches, okay?
       - Oh, I feel good.
        - Liza Minnelli.
            - I said
      Lady Bunny's palace.
          - Her palace?
    - Because there's nothing
    like playing the Palace.
           [all laugh]
     Mama played the Palace
            and I sat
    right in the fourth row.
              -Wow.
     -She sang right to me.
      And to all the other
          homosexuals.
           [all laugh]
 - All right, let's move on down
  to superstar Alyssa Edwards.
          What say you?
        - I wrote snatch.
        - In her snatch.
     Not a match for Denis.
          - Did I lose
        the Q&A portion?
        - No, you didn't.
            [laughs]
   All right, Jasmine Masters.
             The new
     "American Horror Story"
         is going to be
      the scariest one yet.
       It all takes place
       in Lady Bunny's...
         - American who?
       If it's not on BET,
    I don't know what it is.
           [all laugh]
    - So if it's not on BET,
       you don't watch it?
        - Hell to the no.
         - Oh. [laughs]
     Amanda Lepore, the new
     "American Horror Story"
         is going to be
      the scariest one yet.
       It all takes place
       in Lady Bunny's...
    - Plastic surgery office.
           She clearly
      isn't going to mine.
   - Oh, my God. Can you move
        your face at all?
   - I'm moving it right now.
           - [laughs]
     - So let's move on down
       to Naomi Campbell.
   I see you have a cell phone
          right there.
    - When I got here to set,
            your crew
      confiscated my phone,
          but luckily,
    my good friend back here
      had a little prepaid
          Cricket phone
     that she let me borrow
       for the afternoon.
           Chris Rock,
        thank you so much
      for letting me borrow
           your phone.
           - Oh, dang!
        - I thought about
  Tyra Bank's modeling career,
   so I just said the toilet.
           - [laughs]
    All right. Gigi Gorgeous,
        what do you have?
         - I think that
    it's gonna be her fridge.
  I highly doubt that she eats
   organic, gluten-free food,
           and I would
        just be terrified
           to open up
      the refrigerator, Ru.
       - It's not a match.
  Now, Candis, you're up next.
         - Okay, hit it.
       - I just found out
         my cat is gay.
      Last night, he didn't
      cough up a fur ball.
     He coughed up a blank.
      Pens down, everybody.
       Okay, Candis Cayne.
       - My cat is so gay,
   a purse fell out his mouth.
   - That is one gay pussycat.
              Okay.
        Marlene Dietrich?
   - As a point of principle,
     I make sure that every
  homosexual pussy that I meet
       receives a Marlene
       signed photograph.
     - Not a match, Candis,
           I'm afraid.
       - I'd love to give
      Fraulein Candis Cayne
      a signed photograph.
            I promise
     that Teutonic bisexuals
     make the most forceful
    and unforgettable lovers.
           [all laugh]
 - All right. Let's move on down
        to Ms. Colombia--
  Well, actually, Ms. Colombia,
    did you write an answer?
   - I can never win anything.
           - [laughs]
            -[cries]
  -She's not gonna get very far
        in this business
         like that, Ru.
           [all laugh]
      - Gigi Gorgeous, what
    did you write down, girl?
  - He coughed up an Anastasia
    Beverly Hills lip gloss.
           - Oh, okay.
       Well, not a match,
         unfortunately.
        Jasmine Masters.
      Jasmine, what season
     were you on<i> Drag Race?</i>
        - Does it matter?
           Did I win?
           - [laughs]
       All right, Jasmine.
       Do you have a match
           for Candis?
      - I don't own a cat.
        They sense evil.
         - Oh. [laughs]
  All right, this is a question
        for Denis O'Hare.
        Snapchat filters
    are getting so inventive.
 Now instead of swapping faces,
       you can swap blank.
      - You can swap wives.
          - Swap wives!
         Sofia Vergara,
          what say you?
        - You know what?
  I think it's related to what
    are you looking to swap.
    So maybe I said titties.
  They help me to be successful
 in this entertainment business.
      It's part of the why,
            you know.
  - Girl, where are the jokes?
      Where are the jokes?
         Sofia is funny.
           [whispers]
      Where are the jokes?
           - Let's go
      to Marlene Dietrich.
  - Well, I found this question
         kind of unfair
      because, as you know,
 I rarely know these new things.
    I rarely leave my house.
              - No.
          - And I died
        many decades ago.
    - You did. This is going
  somewhere, I can tell, yeah.
 - So I wrote (speaking German)
         and sauerkraut.
      - That's not a match,
  but a very, very good answer
      and a long way to go
         for an answer.
           I love it.
     All right, let's rewind
        down to the ATL.
  NeNe Leakes is in the house.
   Instead of swapping faces,
       you can swap what?
   - If I was gonna do an app
     or some kind of filter
          on Snapchat,
    I would definitely do one
         for poor people
      like Jasmine Masters.
     Now, if Jasmine Masters
 were gonna have a filter on her
   discontinued Cricket phone,
     she would probably have
  to swap credit scores first.
        - Credit scores.
            - Bloop.
      - Not a match, Denis.
    You're looking for wives.
          - I've known
      a couple of husbands.
             - Yeah.
    All right, Liza with a Z.
        - Ru, I said that
    you can swap jazz hands.
        - Can you show us
        your jazz hands?
           [all laugh]
    All right, Ms. Colombia,
        what do you have?
  - In my country, we are known
       for beautiful woman
    and I think also cocaina.
       - Cocaine, cocaina.
   - I think now I understand,
            hermana,
    why you lost the pageant.
     This is not the shadow
        I know, you know,
   because I love her so much,
          ay dios mio!
             - Oh...
            Cynthia.
 Girl, I'm sure Eureka is pissed
      somewhere right now.
       She gonna be, like,
      I went home for this?
    - Well, that's our show.
      And the winner is...
    all the celebrities that
  weren't impersonated tonight.
     Good night, everybody.
            [laughs]
         <i> - Coming up...</i>
          - Category is
    Night of 1,000 Madonnas.
             Uh-oh.
     - How does that happen?
   [RuPaul laughs, bell rings]
         [RuPaul laughs]
    - It is elimination day,
  and we all have to get ready
          for the Night
       of 1,000 Madonnas,
         the redemption.
    - I don't know about you,
         but personally,
         I like to have
        a big separation
    between Trinity and Ryan.
          And it's not
        necessarily like,
        oh, I don't want
     to be feminine or any--
   'cause I'm a feminine guy.
    - I just don't understand
       society's obsession
           with trying
       to label something.
        I just feel like
         gender's over.
       It's so fluid now.
         It was actually
         through my drag
         that I realized
         my trans-ness.
           - Oh, wow.
         So you identify
        as trans, Pepper?
      - I am a--I'm trans.
        I'm a transwoman.
     There's a lot of people
   who think that drag queens
 are not trans and shouldn't be.
           And there's
      a lot of trans people
 who think that drag queens have
no place in the trans community.
       I wanted to really
      get to know the girls
   before I came out to them.
          I was afraid.
     It took me a long time
   to really sort out gender.
   And at a really early age,
           I was able
      to latch on to drag,
   and that was how I was able
    to express my femininity.
             - Yeah.
     - But I kind of evolved
           to realize
    that all the drag things
      that I wanted to do,
       it always led back
       to the realization
     that I'm a transwoman.
      - That is courageous.
         - Yes, Pepper.
       - Thank you so much
        for saying that.
     - I love that so much.
     Peppermint is giving us
    her true, authentic self,
     and it's just wonderful
         and I love her
      and I look up to her
            so much.
      - I just want to say
        thank you so much
  for the support and the love
        and the affection
   that you guys have shown me
        just in general.
     And I just really want
     to thank you for that.
             - Oh...
         - We love you.
       - Come on, Pepper.
       - It feels so good
      to be fully accepted.
     I'm so happy right now.
          I'm so happy.
           [chuckles]
         [RuPaul laughs]
           - And what?
   - Welcome to the main stage
     of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
       My favorite Madonna
 impersonator, Michelle Visage.
    - I'm looking for Susan.
       Have you seen her?
        - I'm desperately
          seeking her.
           - Me, too.
        - Style superstar
        Carson Kressley.
            - Hello.
       - Your Ross Mathews
    impersonation is spot on.
  - I crawled real deep inside
   Ross Mathews to play this.
          [both laugh]
   - "American Horror Story's"
          Denis O'Hare.
      Now, when you played
    Liz Taylor, did you tuck?
      -Tucking is barbaric.
              -Oh.
          No, darling.
     Untucking is barbaric.
           [all laugh]
      And the scintillating
          Candis Cayne.
   Now, what star would you do
       for "Snatch Game?"
        - I have no idea.
   - Let me guess, Judge Judy?
             - Yes.
           [all laugh]
          - This week,
    we challenged our queens
     to snatch our attention
          and tonight,
          category is,
    Night of 1,000 Madonnas,
          the She-quel.
           Gentlemen,
       start your engines.
   And may the best woman win.
         Category is...
        Aja, last night,
     she dreamt of San Pedro
          or Del Taco,
      if I'm not mistaken.
     - I'm just showing off
       my little ruffles.
I feel like I should've came out
      with some castanets.
            [laughs]
       - La is La Boniba.
         Alexis Michelle
     as Breathless Mahoney.
            More like
       breathless my hand.
           [all laugh]
       - I love my shape.
       I love the sequin.
         I'm breathless.
     - Has anyone seen Dick?
              -Who?
             -Tracy.
      - Oh, my bottom hurts
     just thinking about it.
     Peppermint. Experience
   has made her a rich bitch.
   - Trying to buy our votes.
       - This is probably
   my favorite Madonna video.
    This gorgeous woman being
  surrounded by all these guys.
         It's my dream.
  - Talk to me, Harry Winston.
   Shea Coulee, Material Girl.
            Déjà vu.
            - I think
      she stole that look.
   - This is the second wife,
 the one that gets all the money
 and the diamonds and the furs.
            You know,
       all the good goods.
          - Drag queens
    really do prefer blondes.
         Trinity Taylor.
              -Ooh.
      -Givenchy better do.
        [Michelle laughs]
          - My Madonna
      is the only Madonna.
   I feel like a very strong,
    powerful bitch right now.
        - It's a pantsuit
       without the pants.
        - Who needs pants
   when you have all this ass?
       Nina Bo'nina Brown
         Louise Ciccone.
            - I think
    I've met this one before.
      -Who wore it better?
      -Hmm, we'll find out.
  - Right now, I'm just trying
    to serve a black version
           of Madonna,
       even though they'd
     just seen this outfit.
   - Don't get mad, get plaid.
          Sasha Velour.
              - Oh.
       - Her name is Dita
 and she will be your mistress.
          - Nice grill.
       - This is very much
    the type of Madonna look
        that inspired me
          and my style.
     And I'm really excited
             to show
         that I can walk
      like a fashion model.
        - Put your hands
       all over her body.
           [all laugh]
     Farrah Moan, Cleopatra.
             - Wow.
    - My Madonna is probably
       the best one here.
    Every detail is on point.
  - Well, this Super Bowl look
          is a homerun.
           [all laugh]
          - Aren't you
        mixing metaphors?
   - Do you mean a touchdown?
     - Cynthia Lee Fontaine.
              -Oh!
             -Uh-oh.
           - [laughs]
             - Ole.
        - Mata-adorable.
   - Nobody's wearing my look?
              Whoo!
       [speaking Spanish]
  - I think she lost her bull.
          - Valentina.
              -Oh.
              -Hmm.
           - You know,
       I hate censorship.
           - Me, too.
     - When Madonna came out
         with this look,
    it was so controversial.
And showing this much of my body
     is controversial, too.
         - I'll walk out
      the way I walked in.
             Naked.
           [all laugh]
         <i> - Coming up...</i>
           -Slam dunk.
             -Brava.
     - Uh, no, not so good.
   [RuPaul laughs, bell rings]
         [RuPaul laughs]
   - Ladies with an attitude,
    I've made some decisions.
     When I call your name,
      please step forward.
         Trinity Taylor.
              Aja.
           Valentina.
          Shea Coulee.
       Ladies, this week,
 you did not cause a commotion.
          You're safe.
    You may leave the stage.
            It's time
    for the judges critiques,
          starting with
        Alexis Michelle.
   - You do such a good Liza,
   she better watch her back.
 - Even the way your breathed in
    after you spoke was Liza.
           - [inhales]
          - That's what
       I'm talking about.
        - And that dress
         is painted on.
       You look gorgeous.
   - I feel momentum with you.
           Keep it up.
     - Next up, Peppermint.
  - This is one of my favorite
         Madonna looks,
           and I think
       you look beautiful.
   - But three weeks in a row
         we've had pink,
     so I am looking forward
        to another color.
      Okay, so NeNe Leakes.
    She is larger than life,
    but I felt like you were
   just being a regular girl.
        - Credit scores.
     - She serves attitude.
     She serves one-liners.
       You could have gone
       anywhere with her.
       But it just doesn't
     cross the finish line.
         - Sasha Velour.
      - Erotica, slam dunk.
        I'm loving seeing
     this other side of you.
            - I love
     the big circle nipples.
          I can't stop
        looking at them.
          I don't know
        what that means.
      And in "Snatch Game,"
             for me,
    it was like Jessica Lange
         in "Freakshow"
     meets "Touch of Evil."
        I thought it was
       just extraordinary.
             Brava.
         - Farrah Moan.
   - This look is so gorgeous,
           and you did
    such a great job with it.
         - I love Gigi.
          I know Gigi.
         And I feel like
    you could have pushed it,
      made it more comedic.
        - I thought maybe
         you were gonna
throw a bunch of makeup products
       over your shoulder.
             I think
     you only did that once.
       - For some reason,
       I thought there was
     gonna be more questions
   and I'd have opportunities
           to do more.
       - See, that's what
       young people think.
      You see, when you get
     to be my age, you know,
   you get one chance, sonny,
        and you take it.
   Up next, Nina Bo'nina Brown
         Bader Ginsberg.
           [all laugh]
  - I so would have loved this
    if I didn't see Trinity's
      version of this look.
           You get it.
    It's just a heightened...
  -Yeah, it was more tailored.
            -Exactly.
          - But I loved
      your Jasmine Masters.
     The voice was spot on.
        - Hell to the no.
          - You played
       by your own rules.
        You didn't answer
          the questions
     the way they were meant
         to be answered.
    You answered them the way
   you wanted to answer them.
   I thought that was really,
          really cool.
          - Thank you.
     - Cynthia Lee Fontaine.
             - Hola!
            - I love
    good boy-drag-drag-girl.
          - Thank you.
   - But something's going on
     with your makeup, mija.
      I see too much brown
            going on.
     It's almost a mustache.
       - I love the choice
    of Sofia Vergara for you,
     but I didn't understand
       what was going on.
    And it wasn't the accent.
    - I literally don't think
   there was one joke in that.
           And you had
       a regular dress on.
     Sofia Vergara has tits
   that are bigger than mine.
      - Thank you, ladies.
   I think we've heard enough.
    While you take a holiday,
        the judges and I
        will deliberate.
        Now, just between
     us material squirrels,
       what do you think?
        Let's start with
        Alexis Michelle.
    - Last week was the mall.
     This week was couture.
 - And in "Snatch Game," she was
 witty, but in character witty.
      She wasn't making fun
        of the character.
          She was being
         the character.
      For me, it's a tossup
           between her
      and Marlene Dietrich.
       - But her Liza was
    the best characterization
and the thing that I'll remember
    about this "Snatch Game"
    more than anything else.
          - Peppermint.
    - Tonight on the runway,
    I felt like it was, like,
          more Marilyn
      than it was Madonna.
        And her character
      in the "Snatch Game"
             for me
      was one of the worst.
    If she didn't say bloop,
      I wouldn't have known
       it was NeNe Leakes.
         - In fairness,
       I said bloop first,
      and then she said it.
   - But it happens to people
       when they're acting
           sometimes.
     They get in their head.
      - But I'm not getting
  what I know she can deliver.
         - Sasha Velour.
     - Tonight on the runway
        was a 10 for me.
  - And even with the whip, it
made a link to Marlene Dietrich.
      - Yes, that's right.
        - It is not easy
   to deliver Marlene Dietrich
   and have it be interesting
     to this time and place.
    - What I love about Sasha
      is she knows her lane
   and she never lets me down.
         Sasha's got me.
         - Farrah Moan.
       - I just feel like
     she knew who Gigi was,
       but didn't know how
      to get anything more
      than "hi" out of her.
      - I think she thought
 that by choosing Gigi Gorgeous,
    it would gain her points
         in the sort of
    underground cool factor,
         which it does.
             - Yes.
    - But it didn't give her
   enough options as a player.
       - Isn't it ironic,
  the cool ones ended up being
        Marlene Dietrich
       and Liza Minnelli,
          and the kids
        don't even know.
             -Right.
 -But I thought her Madonna look
  was maybe the most intricate
         of everybody's.
      - Nina Bo'nina Brown.
  - We've been waiting for her
   to stop with the boo-hooing
         and step it up,
           and I think
       as Jasmine Masters,
    it was a big step forward
        for Nina Bo'nina.
   - Denis, a little backstory
       for you and Candis.
         Nina comes from
     the Atlanta drag scene,
         who have never
      really accepted her.
      So when she got here,
     she felt some kind of a
 conspiracy theory against her.
 - I think it's kind of amazing
         in a meta theme
 that she chose Jasmine Masters
   to express her discontent.
              -Yes.
    -Because Jasmine Masters
       is the poster child
         for discontent.
            -[laughs]
      -But that being said,
     I saw a very confident,
    fully realized character.
      - But on the runway,
      uh, no, not so good.
            - Uh-oh.
     - One thing I will say
          as a sidebar,
 I don't like when these queens
        do other queens.
             - Yeah.
       - Like, I feel like
     it's an easy way to go.
      - I'm with Michelle.
        I feel like when
   you're doing "Snatch Game,"
      it's somebody that's
     beyond your knowledge.
       - Okay. We've come
 to that portion in our program
   where we have to talk about
    the elephant in the room.
      - Oh, I'm on a diet.
           [all laugh]
           - Not you.
      Cynthia Lee Fontaine
        as Sofia Vergara.
       - It was this mess,
   this just nonsensical mess.
- And she's got a Spanish accent
    and it didn't even work.
      How does that happen?
    - Perhaps she's too close
        to the character.
      If she went somewhere
      very, very different,
       she might have had
        a better effect.
      - Think of Yara Sofia
        as Amy Winehouse.
              -Yes.
          -We all died.
      - Exactly. She should
    have played Maggie Smith.
           [all laugh]
     - It's not good enough.
     She got a second chance
          to come back.
   She should be twice as good
    as the rest of the girls.
       - All right, kids.
            Silence.
           Bring back
      my Madonna wannabes.
   [RuPaul laughs, bell rings]
         [RuPaul laughs]
     - Welcome back, ladies.
    I've made some decisions.
          Sasha Velour.
      Your Marlene Dietrich
       was a ray of light.
        Alexis Michelle.
       Your Liza Minnelli
       left us breathless.
        Alexis Michelle,
       con-drag-ulations.
        You're the winner
    of this week's challenge.
      You've won a dazzling
      $2,000 prize package
   from Sparkles rhinestones.
      - Thank you so much.
           [all laugh]
   - Sasha Velour, great job.
    You're safe. You may join
        the other girls.
       Nina Bo'nina Brown,
          you're safe.
    - [deep voice] Thank you.
           [all laugh]
     - Cynthia Lee Fontaine.
   The judges were not bullish
     on your Sofia Vergara.
   I'm sorry, my dear, but you
     are up for elimination.
     - I feel very confused
   because I wasn't expecting
          to be, like,
      second week in a row
         in the bottom.
     - Peppermint, your NeNe
          was a no-no.
   You needed better material,
              girl.
          Farrah Moan.
     Your Gigi was gorgeous,
      but your comic timing
         wasn't pretty.
         Farrah Moan...
          you're safe.
          You may join
        the other girls.
           Peppermint,
       I'm sorry, my dear,
         but you are up
        for elimination.
   Two queens stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last chance
          to impress me
        and save yourself
        from elimination.
      The time has come...
            [thunder]
           to lip sync
    [echoing] for your life.
- I'm about to do the thing that
   I know how to do the best.
      Actually, I'm worried
          for Cynthia.
          - Good luck,
      and don't fuck it up.
          [music plays]
           [all laugh]
        - Come on, bitch!
           [all laugh]
           -Whoo-whoo!
             -Yeah!
           [applause]
            - Ladies,
     I've made my decision.
           Peppermint,
        shante, you stay.
           [applause]
      Cynthia Lee Fontaine,
        I am so grateful
       we all had a chance
  for a second helping of cucu.
        Now sashay away.
        - Love you, mami.
   Believe in yourself, okay?
   See you later, mis amores.
              Cucu!
           - [laughs]
       - I'm not defeated,
      and I just appreciate
    that Mama RuPaul give me
  this opportunity back again.
    There's going to be a lot
     of cucu in the future.
      Cynthia Lee Fontaine
            forever.
      - Con-drag-ulations,
           my queens.
         Now, remember,
   if you can't love yourself,
         how in the hell
  you gonna love somebody else?
        Can I get an amen
           up in here?
             -Amen!
             -Amen!
    - Now let the music play!


          <i> - Previously</i>
    <i> on</i> RuPaul's Drag Race...
   - We gonna be playing some
    <i> Snatch Game</i> up in here.
           [all cheer]
           [all laugh]
              -No!
             -Bloop!
           - Titties.
  They help me to be successful
 in this entertainment business.
          - Peppermint.
    - NeNe Leakes, you could
  have gone anywhere with her,
       but it just doesn't
     cross the finish line.
     - Cynthia Lee Fontaine.
       - I love the choice
    of Sofia Vergara for you,
     but I didn't understand
       what was going on.
    And it wasn't the accent.
       - Alexis Michelle.
   - You do such a good Liza,
   she better watch her back.
      - Con-drag-ulations.
        You're the winner
    of this week's challenge.
          - Peppermint,
       shantay, you stay.
      Cynthia Lee Fontaine,
          sashay away.
         - Oh, my gosh,
        this is so tight.
      - I think Peppermint
       is a little shaken
           after being
       in the bottom two.
    But that lip sync, girl,
     she did the damn thing.
 I think we got a real lip sync
     assassin on our hands.
- I'm just so happy that Cynthia
      had a second chance.
           She brought
      so much love and joy.
          - I love her,
        but, bye, bitch!
  - Trinity is the new official
    messy queen of Season 9.
           - No, I am
     the new official cucu.
              -Oh!
             -Whoo!
              -Hey!
              -Yes.
      - Cynthia went home,
       and unfortunately,
     that's how this cookie
        is gonna crumble
       for a lot of girls.
     There can only be one,
     and some of these girls
           got to go.
         Congratulations
         to you, though.
          I'm so happy
     that you actually won.
           - Ross said
      that I am rising up.
   It felt really good to get
  some really strong critiques.
        Thank you, Ross.
   I will take that to heart.
        - Alexis Michelle
    finally won a challenge.
     Girl, watch out 'cause
     she is going to make it
     She's going to make it
        the Alexis show.
          - I feel good
        about what I did,
    and hopefully from now on
     I can just kind of like
        have a little fun
      and let down my guard
          a little bit.
             -Good.
       -No, not hopefully.
    From now on, you're gonna
       let down your guard
       and have more fun.
          Right, girl?
          - Okay, mom.
  Thank y'all for all y'all's,
            you know,
     support and reading me
         behind my back.
       - Girl, we read you
       to your face, too.
 From now on, we ain't gonna be
 giving you no more compliments
      'cause now you's some
    real competition, bitch.
 -So let's get out of this drag.
   -Well, on that note, bitch.
            - [sighs]
      - You guys, who am I?
         - [whiny voice]
      I need to smoke, why?
    You can never wear enough
          highlighter.
              Oh...
        - The competition
    is getting a lot tighter.
        I feel like I am
      a strong competitor.
    But there are some other
   really strong competitors.
        - I'm not taking
      nothing for granted.
            - Ow! Ow!
               Ow!
            Aah! God.
       - You got to do it
        like a Band-Aid.
         It's not a time
       to get comfortable.
     - That was so painful.
        Thank you, babe.

     - Hello, hello, hello.
           [all cheer]
        Ladies, get ready
       to rewind to 1993.
       - When I was born!
     - You were born in '93?
             - Yeah.
    - I'm gonna fuck you up.
           [all laugh]
         For this week's
         maxi challenge,
       you'll be acting in
   a classic high school drama
       that we're calling
            <i> 9021-Ho.</i>
           [all laugh]
    And you can hashtag that.
             #9021HO
          Later today,
   you'll head over to the set
   to meet your co-directors,
        from the original
      <i> Beverly Hills 90210,</i>
   the legendary Jennie Garth
       and Tori Spelling.
           [cheering]
       - My mind is blown.
   - Peppermint, you survived
      last week's lip sync,
      so you get to assign
           the roles.
   It's back to class, ladies,
      but this time, you're
    going to rule the school.
          So good luck,
      and don't fuck it up.
  - Oh, my God, this is great.
             - Wow.
      -<i> 90210</i> was the show
    that I would, like, sneak
into my brother's room to watch.
      This is my childhood
           right here.
     I'm an expert on<i> 90210,</i>
     so I feel really ready
       for this challenge.
          - All right,
      let's go through it.
     Blenda Schmaltz, she's
 the original high school bitch.
    Monna Dartin, good girl.
         She's a virgin.
          Then there's
      Grandrea Zuckerwoman,
     the high school senior
     who looks 50 years old.
       Ooh, she's pregnant
    and doesn't know it. Wow.
          - Do you have
        any inclinations?
          - My approach
       is to ask the girls
   what roles they want to do,
             because
    I don't want to be blamed
   if somebody doesn't do well
       in this challenge.
    I want to know if there's
anything that speaks to anybody.
     - My first two choices
     are Mirror Monna Dartin
  or Bethani Glamber Gliessen.
      - I was kind of into,
          like, Blenda.
        - I kind of like
          all of them,
   but, like, my favorites are
  Mirror Monna Dartin or Blenda
      because they're both
        bitchy and nasty.
             - Okay.
     So, ladies, I have cast
         the production.
   The role of Blenda Schmaltz
         will be played
     by Nina Bo'nina Brown.
             - Word.
       Thank you, Pepper.
            - Bethani
     will be played by Shea.
             - Yes.
     - Grandrea Zuckerwoman
     will be played by Aja.
  - That was none of my picks.
         - I know that.
          [sighs] God.
     - Don't roll your eyes.
 - Don't get in your head, girl.
      - It's gonna be good.
     - It's just frustrating
        because I always
           land a role
       that I don't want.
  - Let's just make this work.
           - Can I go
        on a smoke break?
  - Are you that stressed out?
      - Yeah, I don't want
         to be Grandrea.
    - Girl, you gotta grow up
    and accept the challenge.
       - I don't have to.
            - [sighs]
          If it's going
        to be that tense,
       I'll take Grandrea
          and she can--
     - No, you don't have to
because it's not your detriment.
      - What I'm saying is,
           I can do--
        - You know what?
     I'm making a decision.
   You two are swapping roles.
    - I don't want to be a--
    - You're swapping roles.
            - I know,
     but I'm not trying to--
       - You already said
        you're stressed.
      I know how you feel.
        But now what role
          do you have?
            -Bethani.
    -Are you cool with that?
     - Yeah, I'm cool with--
   like, I don't mean trouble.
  - It's just we got a lot to--
        - Let's rehearse.
      - I think Aja doesn't
     want to play a grandma.
  It's one of the biggest parts
          in the show,
      and you traded it in
     for a bitch who's only
       in the last scene.
  So now you look like a bitch
         playing a bitch
       in the last scene.
      - I feel so childish
           right now.
  - Well, you probably should,
              girl.
         <i> - Coming up...</i>
            -Action.
            -Action.
   [RuPaul laughs, bell rings]
         [RuPaul laughs]
       - I'm the new bitch
         in this school.
    - Who wants my virginity?
       - Mom, what are you
           doing here?
   This week's maxi challenge
      is to act in the new
       TV classic<i> 9021-Ho.</i>
      - We need to, like--
    we need to run off like--
         like run, like,
       flipping our hair.
   - Me and Trinity are going
     to add a little quirks
   and kirks--is that a word?
           Qui--quirk.
  We're adding little quirks--
   Are you sure that's a word?
             Quirks.
   Anyways, we're doing these
     little things together,
 and I think it's going to read
     really well on camera.
     - She didn't wear it up
     on her head like that.
        - But that's very
         nineties to me.
 - Um, can I make a suggestion?
       - Yeah, what's up?
   - 'Cause you say your name,
             right?
        - Yeah, Grandrea.
    - Say it--yeah, Grandrea,
        so that it sounds
          like Andrea.
    - Okay, girl, we get it.
   You watched the show a lot.
  - They definitely had, like,
      more natural eyebrows
        in the nineties.
     So, like, not too thin
     or not too sculptural.
          - Girl, bye.
             <i> Fuera.</i>
       - It's time for us
        to shoot<i> 9021-Ho.</i>
     I'm looking to toe up,
       but I'm loving it,
      and I'm ready to go.
        - Hello, ladies.
    I'm Jennie and I will be
      your director today.
        - Excuse me, hi.
            I'm Tori.
  Actually, I'm your director.
      - You know what, Tor?
   It's not always about you,
              okay?
    - Well, of course, it is.
    - Hmm. I've been wanting
     to do this a long time.
            - [gasps]
              - Oh!
           And scene.
           [all laugh]
         - Now, ladies,
  that's what you call acting.
         - Let's see it.
       Places, everybody.
            - And...
            -Action.
            -Action.
            - Uh, uh,
    I'm Grandrea Zuckerwoman
      and I'm a... [coughs]
        I'm a... [coughs]
          I'm a senior.
        - A senior what?
      - [laughs and snorts]
           - And cut.
       - Shea, your cough
        and snort combo--
    really, really something.
       - Well, thank you.
    I'm a terrible asthmatic.
            [laughs]
        - Let's move on.
   - Maybe at this new school,
 you shouldn't be such a bitch.
   - Where are the cool people
        at in the school?
              -Cut.
       -Nina, maybe try it
           with, like,
        a different tone.
 - Where are the cool people at?
          This school.
              - No.
      Maybe lose the pause
          before "at."
   - Where are the cool people
         at this school?
           - Where are
       the cool people at?
   - Where are the cool people
         in this school?
  - Our milkshakes are melting
       because Nina keeps
      messing up her lines,
     and it's taking forever
     for them to get to us.
     - The girl-to-boy ratio
           here blows.
    - Nina, I would recommend
       maybe articulating
 a little bit more on that line.
     - The girl-to-boy ratio
             blows.
    - Nina speaks super fast.
       La-la-la-la-la-la.
          - Hey, Nina.
    - The girl-to-boy ratio.
   Just make sure that we can
  really understand your words.
        -Time to move on.
            -Action.
            - [gasps]
       Oh, my God, Marta--
            [laughs]
        - Did you forget
          who you were?
      -Yeah. I got it now.
             -Okay.
         - Marna Donny--
  Sorry. Can I start that over?
             - Cut.
         -Monna Dartin.
         -Okay, got it.
       -You okay, Farrah?
          -Yeah, sorry.
            - Got it?
          Okay. Action.
   - Oh, my God, Monna Dartin,
         we're seniors.
    - There's enough calories
      in that to kill you.
      But we all gotta die
          of something.
             - Cut.
      Uh, Sasha, ham it up.
   Don't be afraid to go big.
          - And I think
     your whole performance,
  you could be just a little--
           -Notch up.
            -Boozier.
             -Okay.
          -And action.
     - Mom, stop copying me.
            No wonder
     I'm addicted to speed.
         - I'm addicted
         to speed, too.
        -No, you're not!
        -No, you're not!
              -Mom!
              -Mom!
            -[laughs]
            -And cut.
    Trinity, you were great.
      You were like bang on
    through the whole scene.
          So good job.
      This is a big scene.
  - This is my favorite scene.
       There's two Donnas.
          - Two Donnas.
      -And no Kelly. Yeah.
     -Of course you love it.
      - You're going to be
     talking into a mirror,
 and your actor is not going to
  be there talking back to you,
         so that can get
        really confusing.
     - Kind of like<i> Avatar.</i>
         - It's nothing
          like<i> Avatar.</i>
            -[laughs]
          -And action.
 - Dear darling Monna, of course
     you're still a virgin.
  You're scared of everything.
           - And cut.
     You are like the devil,
   so I would say amp that up.
             -Okay.
          -Like, a lot.
        - Okay, energy up
           and action.
      - But I've never had
         a drink before.
       - Listen, chickie,
     it's plain and simple.
      Get drunk at the prom
     and get yourself laid!
        - But I'm scared.
           - And cut.
     - You did a great job.
  I really believe that you're
     so sweet and innocent.
           -But I am.
            -[laughs]
       - This is the prom,
         you guys, so...
        - Didn't you love
       those dance scenes?
       - No, I hated them.
   They take forever, all day.
             - Yeah.
     - Remember, everybody,
       stay in character.
       If you're a bitch,
   be a bitch the whole time.
      - If you're a whore,
           be a whore.
             - Yeah.
           [all laugh]
    Are you talking about me?
    - No, did I look at you?
           - You did.
    - Places, please, ladies.
             Action.
     - I want to sex you up.
             - Okay.
        - Cut, cut, cut.
          Sorry, guys.
         Kissing scenes
       are always awkward.
       - Mm-hmm. You have
     to touch lips. I mean--
      - You have to make it
           look real.
        - We don't care.
          We'll do it.
    - We'll kiss. We'll kiss.
       - Here comes all of
    Aja's tongue in my mouth.
           - [laughs]
         - We might have
   to get married after this.
             - Cut.
        That is a print.
         Let's move on.
            -Action.
            -Action.
       - We're never going
    to see each other again.
         - Yes, we are.
  We're gall going to the sa--
     I'll start over again.
          Yes, we are.
           We're going
      to the same college.
   We're gonna work together.
             - Cut.
   - Aja, she is a real bitch.
         Let's see that.
           And action.
         - Yes, we are.
         We're all going
      to the same college.
           We're gonna
      work together again.
     - I just have one thing
      to say, and that's--
           Oh, oh, oh!
     I'm not even pregnant.
            -And cut.
            -And cut.
         - Well, I think
      our job here is done.
              -Yep.
   -Aja's performance is meh.
        Shea took a role
      that she didn't want
    and made it really funny.
          You know Aja
     has got to be cracked.
         <i> - Coming up...</i>
           Category is
      big hair everywhere.
     Take that, Chaka Khan.
        [Michelle laughs]
         [RuPaul laughs,
           bell rings]
         [RuPaul laughs]
              - Ha!
          - Oh, my hair
        looks sickening.
      - We're getting ready
           for runway,
   and I genuinely feel stupid
   for reacting the way I did
           yesterday.
        I'm embarrassed.
   I'm looking back at, like,
    my little stupid tantrum
    and I'm just laughing now
     because it was so dumb.
        - Well, I'm glad
        you can see that.
      - I definitely, like,
   feel like I made a mistake.
  The only thing you can do now
   is just focus on my runway,
         because I need
        to ace this shit.
 - So I know both of you wanted
     to be my date to prom,
          but I finally
         made my choice.
          I choose me.
           - [laughs]
    - I went to so many proms
         in high school.
        - My junior year,
   I went with a boy to prom.
  We went to our winter formal
            in drag.
              -Yes.
          -Oh, my God.
     - This is my good girl
            Kristin.
        - I went to prom,
      and I won Prom King.
              -Yay!
       -Of course you did.
   - My high school experience
            was bad.
         In high school,
    my grandmother got sick.
         She had cancer.
      So the last two years
         of high school,
   I quit school to take care
        of my grandmother
     and just home schooled
             myself.
 My mother died when I was eight
   from complications of HIV.
             She was
     in the wrong business.
    She was an exotic dancer.
         She did drugs.
         So I was raised
       by my grandparents,
       and my grandmother
       got terminally ill
          when I was 16
     and died when I was 18.
        I never got to do
          like a prom.
        I never got to do
          a senior trip
         or a graduation
     or anything like that.
          I missed out
       on a lot of things
       that kids get to do
         in high school,
     but that was my choice.
      I did that on my own
      because I loved her.
           - I've lost
  so many relatives to cancer.
              -Oh.
  -My dad has multiple myeloma,
  which is in the bone marrow.
   I kind of put up a barrier
      between my dad and I
   when I started doing drag.
   He's just never been a man
 that really expressed his love
    through words or actions
   because he's a military man
  and, you know, conservative.
    And then I think because
    of his cancer diagnosis,
      it's put some things
    into perspective for him.
   One day he gave me a call,
         and he's, like,
   I just want to let you know
   that I love you regardless.
           I know that
     you're just an artist,
            that this
       is your expression.
 And it was the most validating
    experience I've ever had.
     And I just realize that
   my time with him is limited
   and he's actually way more
      accepting and loving
   than I gave him credit for.
         - I know it was
   a real struggle for my mom.
     She actually was, like,
    really not comfortable...
            -Onboard?
         -with the drag.
       - Is that something
     that you struggle with
    feeling unresolved about?
       - Yeah. That's why
        I'm a bald queen.
     When she lost her hair,
            she felt
   she couldn't be beautiful.
              -Oh.
              -Oh.
    - Right after I graduated
          from college,
      my mom was diagnosed
          with cancer.
       Chemo made her lose
        all of her hair.
        I am a bald queen
   to represent for my mother.
 Taking all of that and turning
  that into drag in my own way
  was the most important thing
   I've ever done in my life.
         And I feel like
     the drag queen I am now
      is not the drag queen
  that she got to see, either.
   - I really do believe that
    the people that leave us
         are watching us
         and can see us.
             - Yeah.
           - And I bet
     that she's really proud
          of the queen
       that you've become.
          - Thank you.
        - You should try
       to get up a meeting
   with the Hollywood Medium.
  - You know I offer readings,
             right?
             - Girl,
   you know I'm into Santería
  and all that spiritual stuff.
      - I would like that.
          - Aja Queen,
      the Bed-Stuy medium.
      - We'll get together
            one day.
       - We will do that.
    I'll bring you a chicken.
       - [laughs] Shut up!
              Rawk!
         [RuPaul laughs]
            And what?
   - Welcome to the main stage
     of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
 President of the Theater Club,
        Michelle Visage.
        - Ru, can you see
          my follicles?
     - No, but Rizzo is PG.
           Pass it on.
             -Okay.
        -In high school,
    he was voted most likely
   to "tszuj" a straight guy.
        Carson Kressley.
   - Oh, actually, I was voted
    most likely to suck-seed.
           - [laughs]
      The OG Kelly Taylor,
      Jennie Garth is here.
   Now, did you learn anything
         from my girls?
 - How about the more you know,
        the less you ho?
      - It's a good point.
    And the OG Donna Martin,
     Tori Spelling is here.
  Now, Tori, I've always wanted
        to ask you this.
             Mother,
    may I sleep with danger?
         - Yes, you may.
           Mama likie.
            [laughs]
          - This week,
    we challenged our queens
  to star in a new TV classic,
            <i> 9021-Ho.</i>
           Gentlemen,
       start your engines,
   and may the best woman win.
           Category is
      big hair everywhere.
           Valentina.
   - Lily pads for light days.
        - My inspiration
      was Miss Diana Ross.
   Believe it or not, I'm only
   wearing four wigs at once.
       - Ooh, Diana Rose.
       - Well, I'm seeing
    very Donna Summer's-Eve.
           [all laugh]
          Farrah Moan.
      [imitating Mae West]
      Oh, what a big tease.
          -Hubba-hubba.
         -My runway look
      pays homage to RuPaul
        and Dolly Parton.
       I'm really feeling
           this look.
            - I think
     she's prematurely gray.
         Trinity Taylor.
     - That's Barbar-fella.
 - Girl, this wig is standing up
      by the grace of God.
       But my holy Jesus,
       do I look fabulous.
  - Oh, that reminds me. I have
   to get dental floss today.
         - Sasha Velour.
   - It's like Sid ate Nancy.
 - I'm representing a side of me
     and a side of Brooklyn
       that is a necessary
         palate cleanser
      from all these, like,
   big hair pageant beauties.
   - Never mind the Bullocks.
           - Bollocks.
     - I'm talking about the
  department store on Wilshire.
             -Yeah.
       -God, I miss that.
          -Not Sandra?
              -No.
          -Peppermint.
     -Take that, Chaka Khan.
     - I am serving classic,
     old school, disco diva
        with a dangerous
          fiery flair.
              -Hot.
              -Yes.
        - Oil treatment.
           [all laugh]
      - Nina Bo'nina Brown
         Jessica Parker.
    - Oh. She's really taking
  this catwalk thing seriously.
        [Michelle laughs]
    - I like to do sex appeal
    and I like to give face.
 Girl, I'm giving you just cat,
       pussy, girl, pussy.
          - Wake me up
      before you calico-co.
              -Ow.
          -Shea Coulee.
       Yes, honey, she is
    going back to her roots.
             -Okay.
           -I say Shea
      is equal parts bougie
           and banji.
    Bitch, I'm really feeling
     the fantasy right now.
          - That's why
        she's so popular.
     She knows how to handle
           a Big Gulp.
       - Alexis Michelle.
           - Oh, look,
   it's Helena Bottom Carter.
         - Yes. [laughs]
       - I am serving you
         some big hair,
           don't care,
    Ursula-inspired sea hag.
   - Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice,
          Beetlejuice.
              -Aja.
      -Whoomp, there it is.
        - I'm channeling
    a little Queen of Hearts,
   a little Alexander McQueen.
    A lot of queen. [laughs]
          - I know why
       the caged queen...
        - Does something?
           [all laugh]
         -Does she sing?
           -She sings.
         <i> - Coming up...</i>
         -You nailed it.
        -You're perfect.
            - It felt
      kind of flat for me.
   [RuPaul laughs, bell rings]
         [RuPaul laughs]
       - Welcome, ladies.
   Let's take a look at my new
     favorite show,<i> 9021-Ho.</i>
             -Brrrr!
       -Hush up, Michelle.
         My show is on.
       [theme music plays]
      - Wow, our first day
        at a new school.
       Isn't that awesome?
         - No, it sucks.
   The girl-to-boy ratio here
             blows.
   - Maybe at this new school
 you shouldn't be such a bitch.
    Where's our first class?
        - Let's ask that
    old, old lady over there.
      - Hi. Welcome to West
  Beverly Johnson High School.
    I'm Grandrea Zuckerwoman,
      and I'm a-- [wheezes]
            [coughs]
          I'm a senior.
        - A senior what?
       Were you held back
    for, like, three decades?
      - [laughs and snorts]
       I'm also president
     of the abstinence club.
  - I can see that worked out.
   - Hi, I'm Brandy Schmaltz.
           I'm running
      for class president.
             - Okay.
       You two are tragic.
   Where are the cool people?
    - Oh, you must mean them.
    Nelly, she's the totally
       pretty popular one,
    and that's Monna Dartin,
         the last virgin
      of the class of '93.
   - Oh, my God, Monna Dartin,
         we're seniors.
  - Nelly, look, it's Dillard.
      - Are you guys going
      to the prom together?
    - I haven't decided yet.
      And why is the diner
         in the school?
    - Enough damn questions.
       Here's some fries.
   There's enough cholesterol
      in there to kill you.
             - Mmm.
       - We all gotta die
          of something.
        - But not before
      I lose my virginity.
   - Oh, I was a virgin once.
          Then Mr. Adam
       of the Adam's Apple
     gave me his big, thick,
       juicy, foot-long...
            hot dog?
       - I love hot dogs.
     - I love hot dogs, too!
             - Mom!
    What are you doing here?
         - Senior year.
         I'm so excited.
       And prom is coming.
     - Mom! Stop copying me.
            No wonder
     I'm addicted to speed.
         - I'm addicted
         to speed, too!
        -No, you're not.
        -No, you're not.
              -Mom!
              -Mom!
 - Mom, if you don't cut it out,
     I'm gonna join a cult.
            - Honey,
      don't go without me!
              - Oh!
            - [sighs]
      What's wrong with me?
    Why am I still a virgin?
       - Isn't it obvious?
          -Who's there?
             -Psst.
  I'm right here in the mirror,
            dumb-ass.
            - [gasps]
  - No wonder you're a virgin.
  You're afraid of everything.
      You should get wild.
        - Like, do drugs?
         - No! Remember,
       this is your brain.
  This is your brain on drugs,
         on a croissant.
    - Mmm, sounds delicious.
       - Listen, chickie,
     it's plain and simple.
      Get drunk at the prom
     and get yourself laid!
        - But I'm scared.
           - Go, girl.
    - All right, just a sip.
         [clears throat]
   - So I know you both wanted
     to be my date for prom,
     but I've made my choice
       and I choose...me.
        - I'll date you!
            And you!
           - Oh, Mom!
   I can't believe you joined
      the same cult as me.
               Oh.
     - Eww, this prom sucks.
         - God, Blenda,
     don't be such a bitch!
         - Yeah, because
  I'm Bethani Glamber Gliessen,
      and I'm the new bitch
         in this school.
   - Oh, you can't touch this.
      - Whoo! There it is.
    - I'm too legit to quit.
             - Aah!
     Nice try, you 9021-Ho!
              - Oh!
          [bell rings]
    - Ooh, saved by the bell.
              - Oh.
         I'm outta here.
    I'm gonna go play a witch
           on<i> Charmed.</i>
             - Wow.
    I have never seen anybody
      stand up to my sister
        like that before.
           You're hot.
      I want to sex you up.
       - I was gonna wait
   till college to experiment,
           but...okay.
             - Whoo!
               Oh!
      - What's her problem?
            - Party.
            Who wants
      to take my virginity?
        - Oh, that's it,
          Monna Dartin!
     No drag-uation for you.
        - Wait a minute,
         wait a minute.
      You guys, just stop!
         Look, everybody
         makes mistakes.
    You're a terrible mother.
       You joined a cult.
           You're old
      and you're pregnant.
   - Well, I still don't think
      she should drag-uate.
          - Pipe down.
   You're just a fifth season
          replacement.
            - [gasps]
   - So what do you say, guys?
         Let's give her
         another chance.
   Let Monna Dartin drag-uate.
           [chanting]
     Monna Dartin drag-uate.
     Monna Dartin drag-uate.
            - Well...
              Okay.
              -Yay!
              -Yay!
           [cheering]
             - Aah!
      - Fellow drag-uates,
  I just have one thing to say
           and it's...
             Oh! Oh!
            - Honey,
     your water just broke.
          - 23 skidoo.
        - I can't believe
     we all just drag-uated.
        - Hey, everybody,
        I just realized.
        We're never going
    to see each other again.
         - Yes, we are.
         We're all going
      to the same college.
        And you and Nelly
   are going to have your own
      sitcom on ABC Family.
            - I want
   an ABC Family sitcom, too.
           - Oh, Mom.
       I can't even be mad
        at you right now.
        - Hey, everybody.
       The witch is back.
        -Friends forever.
        -Friends forever.
      [cheers and applause]
           - You guys
       did an amazing job.
        But now it's time
    for the judges' reviews.
          <i> Coming up...</i>
           - I thought
       you were hilarious.
      - You look gorgeous.
       You're a follicular
         tour de force.
    - What did you call her?
     [all laugh, bell rings]
         [RuPaul laughs]
       - Welcome, ladies.
    I've made some decisions.
          Farrah Moan.
           Peppermint.
        Alexis Michelle.
      Ladies, you are safe.
    You may leave the stage.
        Now it's time for
  the follica-tease critiques.
      First up, Valentina.
           - I happen
       to love this look.
   I like the way you've also
accessorized it with the gloves,
            which is
    a really beautiful touch.
    - And as Monna Dartin...
        - [clears throat]
            - I mean,
       that's my namesake.
        I thought you had
      a lot of great levels
       and you nailed it.
    - One of the great things
           about Tori
     was that she always did
    a lot of physical comedy,
        and I think that
    you did the role justice.
         You're perfect.
      - Thank you so much.
         -Sasha Velour.
              -Hi.
      - You look different
    from everybody out here.
  And you're on-brand and your
look always has a point of view.
       - It's so on point.
          So on point.
           Literally.
           [all laugh]
     - And your lunch lady.
        I just wanted you
     to go further with it.
     You weren't letting go
           completely.
   - There were a few zingers
in there that quite didn't land.
         - I wish I had
     just played the comedy
        a little bit more
        straightforward.
    And maybe it didn't need
   the Meryl Streep treatment.
         - Yeah, well...
           [all laugh]
        -Trinity Taylor.
       -You look gorgeous.
       You're a follicular
         tour de force.
    - What did you call her?
 - I gotta jump to Nelly's mom,
    because that was amazing.
            I thought
       you were hilarious.
   Your comedy is impeccable.
            - I want
   an ABC Family sitcom, too!
   - You were stealing scenes,
      and it was so right.
     Like, I could lick you
           right now.
  - Up next, Nina Bo'nina Brown
        Carrington Colby.
       - I love all this.
         The only thing
    that's become predictable
         is that legging
    with a boot and a corset.
  So I want to challenge you to
think of a different silhouette.
    - In<i> 9021-Ho,</i> you weren't
    really selling the lines.
          - I feel like
         directing-wise,
  we did work with you the most
      and we felt nervous.
    We felt nervous you were
     going to be mad at us.
    - You know, it was times
        where I was like,
  they really aren't buying it.
       And then, I started
      getting into my head,
      like, I didn't really
     have fun delivering it.
       - Thank you, Nina.
    Shake a leg, Shea Coulee.
     - So normally when you
     come out on this runway
        in a bathing suit
          and a jacket,
      I'm going to read you
            to filth.
           But you put
     so much character in it
        that I bought it.
        I know that girl.
      She's a working girl
        in New York City
   by the Greyhound terminal.
- In your portrayal as Grandrea,
     you were so confident.
         - Your makeup,
       your body language,
    all of it was perfection.
       - What a brilliant
           character.
           I loved it.
       - Thank you, Tori.
         - Up next, Aja.
    - Your makeup is blended,
        and it just looks
     really, really pretty,
  and I love this hair on you.
    Tonight is quite possibly
  the best you've ever looked.
            - As Ti--
       How do you say it?
       - Bethani. Just say
  that which we don't speak of.
   - Yes. We know her as that
    which we don't speak of.
    You didn't feel grounded
            in that.
       - You were playing
           the bitch.
       She's a mean girl,
and it felt kind of flat for me.
    - Now, Aja, you switched
        with Shea Coulee.
    What frightened you about
     playing the older role?
         - To be honest,
    I just kind of...freaked.
           -Thank you.
           -Thank you.
      - Thank you, ladies.
   While you untuck backstage,
        the judges and I
        will deliberate.
   All right, now just between
        us popular kids,
       what do you think?
           Valentina.
       - I thought she did
        a really good job
       just as an actress
    and embodying that part.
        - She was funny,
    she was stumbling around,
          getting into
      her drunk character.
 She was in character the whole
 time until she came off camera
 to tell us that she used watch
   <i> 90210</i> with her babysitter.
  Which made us feel real old.
         - Sasha Velour.
      - Her performance was
 a little underwhelming for me,
    like she could have gone
    so much further with it.
   - She could have sassed the
 character up a little bit more.
        - Trinity Taylor.
      - She played the hell
       out of Nelly's mom.
 She was fully Jennifer Coolidge
     and it was so, so good.
      - She's the ultimate
         scene stealer.
          - Right down
     to her messy lipstick,
   she had the character down.
     - Tonight was a really
    strong night for Trinity.
      - Nina Bo'nina Brown
           Ellis Ross.
      - Her acting, for me,
     was a little bit lost.
  - She alluded to there being
    some friction on the set.
         What happened?
     - She was a little bit
           defensive.
    - That's been an ongoing
       storyline with her.
       - We couldn't tell
        if she was angry
     that we were giving her
           direction.
   - Trust me, she was angry.
          - Oh, really?
        See, I told you.
    - She's out there keying
       your car right now.
         - Yes, exactly.
          Shea Coulee.
  - I thought she was fantastic
    in the acting challenge.
       - Shea went for it
         and then some.
   You couldn't help but fall
  in love with this character.
    - But I was so surprised
       when she walked out
         and she looked
      completely different
     than she did yesterday.
  - She slayed the house down.
             - Aja.
          - The acting
         gave me Aja-ta.
           -Oh, dear.
    -I think it's interesting
      that she threw a fit
   about playing the mean girl
 because she wasn't really mean
   and she wasn't really good.
     -She's not even a girl.
             -Hello.
    She basically handed Shea
       a moment to shine.
 There was one note, one thing,
    hair flip over and over.
    - Hey, a lot of actresses
     have made a big career
         on a hair flip
  and one-note bitch delivery.
          - Sure, yeah.
      - But she's not gonna
         be one of them.
           - Silence.
     I've made my decision.
    Bring back my drag-uates.
   [RuPaul laughs, bell rings]
         [RuPaul laughs]
     - Welcome back, ladies.
    I've made some decisions.
           Valentina,
   as Monna Dartin the virgin,
       you really popped.
         Trinity Taylor,
         as Nelly's mom,
      you had it going on.
  Shea Coulee, making us laugh
          like you did
       will never get old.
         Trinity Taylor,

  Sasha Velour, your lunch lady
         left us hungry.
      - Nina Bo'nina Brown
          Abdul-Jabbar,
    your acting was too tame
       and I ain't lyin'.
         Sasha Velour...
          you are safe.
      - Thank you so much.
             [sighs]
          - Aja, Nina,
      I'm sorry, my dears,
         but you are up
        for elimination.
   Two queens stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last chance
          to impress me
        and save yourself
        from elimination.
      The time has come...

  is way harder than you think.
          I came here,
   and I was like I got this.
            And then
     I was like, okay, okay.
  I feel extremely disappointed
   that I couldn't go further.
     I might be eliminated,
   but every dog has its day.
              Woof.

  This is a serious top five,

       Well, you have won
a lot of challenges this season,
       but it sure isn't
     on that makeup, is it?
       - Well, you know,
      this is how we do it
       in Chicago, bitch.
   - You know, you might want
  to check your kitchen, girl,
 'cause, you know, you already
 been clocked about that once.
     - What you mean, girl?
       I have disco butt.
    - You don't really have
 that much body, do you, honey?
          Do you need
      to go see my doctor?
    - No. We do this natural
          in Chicago.
     - Sasha, what is that
       over on your hand?
  - The feathers are the bird
 that's flying out of the cage.
        I'm being freed.
    - What's with the crown?
        - Well, Alexis,
      I really want to be
           America's
      next drag superstar.
    - Sasha, don't you think
    that's a little literal?
      - It's not literal,
           it's felt.
           It's meta.
         - Wow, Sasha,
      that is really deep.
            - End...
             scene.
           - Uncanny.
       - Alexis Michelle,
  you look so fabulous today.
        - Oh, thank you.
            I'm just
        - Okay, Alexis,
           we got it.
        - Wait a minute.
      I'll be right back.
     - Don't take too long,
        'cause you know
         it's showtime.
   Alexis, what are you doing
          down there?
       - Why you fucking
      look so green, girl?
         - [deep voice]
     I'm not doping, bitch.
           - [laughs]
        You shady ladies
       all did real good.
          [all laugh]
        The winner is...
         Sasha Velour.
             -Yeah.
             -Yeah.
          - You've won
        a $500 gift card
        from Today Tix,
        the last minute
      theater ticket app.
        - Trinity's ass
    floats to the top again.
      - All right, ladies,
     it's time to celebrate
       our queer culture
   like only you queens can.
        For this week's
        maxi challenge,
     we're throwing a ball.
   But not just any old ball.
         We're throwing
     the gayest ball ever!
             -Yeah.
              -Ow!
        #GayestBallEver
      You'll need to work
     three different looks,
            each one
 more gay-tastic than the last.
       First category is
     Rainbow-She-Betta-Do.
         We want to see
         a flaming look
            inspired
      by the rainbow flag.
       Second category is
         Sexy Unicorn.
             -Yes!
             -Ooh.
       - Hooves and horns
      and queens. Oh, my!
          [all laugh]
       Third category is
         Village People
     Eleganza Extravaganza.
              -Oh.
             -Shit.
         - Each of you
     needs to create a look
inspired by the legendary group
      the Village People.
      That's cowboy, cop,
        Native American,
      construction worker,
   and leather biker couture.
           Rrr, rrr.
     So I'm gonna head over
          to the YMCA
        and let you guys
         pick your own
  Village Person inspiration.
      Start your engines,
  and may the best woman win.
            [laugh]
        - We all agreed
     to be very diplomatic
       with the selection
  of the Village People look.
       I end up choosing
     the leather biker look
    because it's all black,
    and everybody looks good
         in all black.
             - Aah!
       Police brutality.
    Hits too close to home.
    - I chose the cop look.
      I'm trying to, like,
    let loose a little bit,
   be a little bit more edgy.
        So, Peppermint,
      what are you making?
       - I'm just trying
           to go for
             a very
    hyper-feminized version
  of the leather daddy/mommy.
    - Pepper, are you going
    for like a fetishy look?
     - I don't really have
        much experience
  with the leather community.
         I'm more like
    the pleather community.
          [all laugh]
          - Peppermint
    has a great personality.
  She has a great personality.
         But her looks,
   they're just not polished,
        so that could be
         her downfall.
         <i> - Coming up...</i>
      What do you think is
going to be your winning ticket?
      - I can always count
         on my smarts.
      - I want to do like
    a patchwork, big skirt--
       - Wait. Let me put
         my earring on.
           - Uh-huh.
  [RuPaul laughs, bell rings]
         - For today's
        maxi challenge,
      we're getting ready
   for the gayest ball ever.
    I'm gonna shit glitter.
           - I chose
      the Native American.
    I want to give something
         that will feel
      a little bit tribal,
    but also ready to wear.
    What I need to use is an
 editing eye in this challenge
          to make sure
      that it feels fresh.
       This is my chance
         to say, like,
         I'm not basic,
         I have taste.
     - Alexis needs to push
     her aesthetic further.
   She needs to modernize it.
          I feel like
     I could go to New York
       and throw a stone
   and hit five other queens
          that can do
     exactly what she does.
            - Hi-ee.
              -Hi.
            -Hello.
     - I'm here. I'm queer.
        Get used to it.
     [cheers and laughter]
          -Hey, Sasha.
          -Hi, RuPaul.
  - Now, you chose the cowboy?
    - Yeah, the cowboy seems
  like a winning choice to me,
        and this fabric
         is incredible.
        But constructing
   is not my strongest suit,
        so I have to be
       very, very clever.
   - Yeah. What do you think
  is gonna be your trump card?
         Oh, did I say
          fuck Trump?
          - Not today.
        - Not on the day.
          - Not today.
- What do you think is gonna be
      your winning ticket?
      - I can always count
          on my smarts
   to push me over the edge.
        - So how are you
      going to reinterpret
       the rainbow flag?
      - Well, it really is
       quite a challenge,
            because
     I'm breaking it apart.
       I'm deconstructing
         the rainbow--
        God, that sounds
      overly intellectual,
      but I promise I have
      an interesting trick
       up my sleeve that
    I'm excited to pull out.
            - Sasha
    is really, really, deep
   and puts a lot of thought
         into her drag,
           and that's
       both an advantage,
         but it's also
    kind of a disadvantage.
     'Cause if nobody knows
   what the hell is going on,
        what difference
      does it make anyway?
            - Whoo.
       - Alexis Michelle.
         - Hi, RuPaul.
   - Now, which character in
  the Village People are you--
         - Wait. Let me
       put my earring on.
       Maybe you'll have
 some sense of what I'm doing.
         Am I the cop?
           - I think
  you're the Native American.
   - I'm the Native American.
     - And why'd you choose
           that one?
       - I saw this bowl
       of these beautiful
   turquoise embellishments,
      and they spoke to me
          immediately,
   and I said, you know what?
  Build the look around these.
           - Uh-huh.
        Now, last week,
 the judges had some critiques
     about your aesthetic.
             -Yes.
   -How'd that make you feel?
          - You know,
       it hurt, actually.
     I did sew my bodysuit
          and leotard.
They weren't Halloween costumes
      I bought in a store.
       - It was just that
     the outfit you created
    wasn't two steps beyond.
        - I think I'm on
   the right track this time,
         and it's time
       to be that Phoenix
          and rise up
      out of those ashes.
   - Good, because, you know,
  we're down to the wire here.
          This is it.
         - This is it.
    - I've chosen something
        very ambitious,
   with the amount of stoning
      that I intend to do
        to this bodice.
        Now is the time
    I've really got to show
  that I belong here visually.
           -Hi, Shea.
           -Hey, Ru.
        - I see lots of
construction worker stuff here.
        Why'd you choose
    the construction worker?
     - I'm a really big fan
      of British fashion,
  you know, Vivienne Westwood,
           Burberry.
      and so I want to do,
      like, an interesting
     kind of like patchwork
           big skirt
        that has, like,
        a lot of, like,
     punk unfinished edges,
   but still really polished
      and fashion forward.
       - Oh, my goodness.
      That's a tall order.
      Now, Shea, last week
          you wound up
       in the bottom two
      for the first time.
     Did that shake you up?
          - Oh, girl,
        it shook me up.
       It shook me down.
    It shook me all around.
- This challenge will determine
        the final four,
      so this is big time.
        This is no joke.
          - Yeah, no.
         My performance
    in last week's challenge
   was just a one time deal.
       Ain't no slip-ups
       from here on out.
     - All right, ladykins,
         gather round.
   Now, tomorrow, in addition
   to your three ball looks,
     I want you to perform
       an opening number
      that pays tribute to
the gayest Olympic sport ever...
      rhythmic gymnastics.
     [cheers and laughter]
      [cheers and screams]
         And that's how
     you get the gold medal
      here at "Drag Race."
           [cheering]
       Now, Sasha Velour,
    you won the bitch fest,
      so you're in charge
      of the choreography.
        - Okay. [laughs]
        - So good luck,
     and don't fuck it up.
     [cheers and laughter]
         <i> - Coming up...</i>
             - Ow!
         - Oh, my God.
       Are you all right?
           - Sasha's
   certainly not delivering.
         This rehearsal
    feels kind of unfocused.
       - Crack the whip.
     - I have been trying.
            - Wham!
  [RuPaul laughs, bell rings]
            - Whoo!
    - [laughs] Now it's time
       for us to rehearse
    our rhythmic gymnastics
            routine.
      - All right, ladies,
       let's get to work.
   - I still don't even know
  what rhythmic gymnastics is,
    but I'm gonna find out.
    - One thing that I loved
  that I saw the Olympians do
           is, like,
   they hold out these things
         so we can have
    that pull apart moment.
          - Yes. So...
    - One, two, three, four.
   - Five, six, seven, eight.
    - Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.
     - This is ridiculous.
         - Okay, okay,
   let's focus, let's focus.
      - One, two, three--
      - No, wait, Trinity.
   - One, two, three, four--
             - Ow!
         - Oh, my God.
       Are you all right?
         - Oh, my God.
           Is it red?
         - No, not yet.
- Bitches getting their ribbons
         tied in knots,
  getting slapped in the face.
         It's actually
    not as easy as it looks.
         - Okay, okay,
  so going from the beginning,
      I come up on three,
     and then all together
        we do something
        on four, right?
            - Yeah.
   And for the next section,
           can we do
    five, six, seven, eight?
         - No. What if
     the first time--okay.
   So what if the first time
  we put Alexis in the middle?
      - Sasha's certainly
        not delivering.
         This rehearsal
    feels kind of unfocused.
   I grew up in the theater.
      I know what it means
   to stage a musical number,
    so I have a perspective
        that could help
       the team out here.
           Can I make
     a suggestion, ladies?
    What do you think about
       storm the judges,
        give good face?
        - I'd rather not
     let it down, actually.
    I think it'll be sloppy
         picking it up.
       I want to keep it
     as simple as possible.
 - Are you guys all comfortable
    with, like, a battement?
     So if we were like...
             -Okay.
        -Shea and Sasha
     think that their ideas
         are the best.
        My point of view
      is just pushed aside
        as second rate.
    May I suggest that we do
     figure eights in place
     for one, two, three--
  - Well, that's gonna change
        how we get off.
         - Well, maybe
    if we just move faster.
         [all talking]
     - I don't want to move
          any faster.
          - I do like
      adding the movement.
     - All right, you guys.
    We need to just decide.
   - There's too many chiefs
    and not enough Indians.
        Crack the whip.
     - I have been trying.
      - Sasha's too nice,
      'cause I would have
   bitched slapped somebody.
             Wham!
  And then twirled my ribbon.
      - And back to work.
        - Motherfucker.
    - How's everybody's look
         coming along?
        -It's horrible!
           -[laughs]
   - I am fucking terrified.
           - Sasha's
      rainbow runway look,
     it's very pedestrian.
      - I'm doing the most
 time consuming part right now.
    It's going to be, like,
 a patchwork on, like, flannel.
  - So you're making a costume
       for Adore Delano?
             -Ooh.
           -[laughs]
    - I didn't know she was
  part of the Village People,
           but okay.
     - Well, no, she wasn't
 a part of the Village People,
     but she was top three,
          unlike you.
       - Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo.
    - I'm just not impressed
            by Shea.
         Cut-off shorts
   and a wife beater? Really?
       Does it look like
     a construction worker?
           Bitch, no.
       So how do you feel
   about the routine, Sasha?
        - I feel, um...
     I feel good about it.
  These are very fun to watch,
     these spinning ribbons.
      - If you're a kitty.
     - Even if you're not.
      - I'm glad it wasn't
    any longer than it was.
      - Ru better give us
          sunglasses,
      'cause it's getting
    hella shady up in here.
          - Honestly--
            - Uh-oh.
        Get ready, girl.
         - I think that
       the dance element
   is not your comfort zone,
   and I saw your insecurity
          around that,
  and it came out a little bit
       in your behavior.
        - I don't think
      that I was insecure
    in the rehearsal at all.
         To be honest,
  I was not being listened to.
  - I don't think you stood up
      as a leader, though.
    - In my opinion, she was
   trying to steer the ship,
         and all of us
were just, like, blah-blah-blah.
      - I did not feel you
       steering the ship.
          - It's clear
        that my strategy
     did not work for you,
          Miss Alexis.
     - Frankly, I also feel
  like you sort of explicitly
           trust Shea
       and Shea's vision
     more than other folks.
        - Actually, no.
        I felt like Shea
    was stepping on my toes
         a little bit.
  - I was honesty just sharing
      my ideas, you know.
        - You definitely
    just, like, straight up
         talked over me
       a bunch of times,
  and it was very challenging.
       - It's going to be
         a tough battle
    to get to the top four.
   I see the claws come out.
       Rreer! Pfft, pfft.
       It ain't<i> RuPaul's</i>
   <i> Best Friend Race</i> no more.
             - Aah!
         <i> - Coming up...</i>
  - I'm living for this look.
        - Chic as fuck.
        - You are over.
          [all laugh]
          [bell rings]
        [RuPaul laughs]
           And what?
  - Welcome to the main stage
     of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
      Trapped in the body
      of a straight girl,
    it's my gay best friend
        Michelle Visage.
         - Let me out.
          Let me out.
          - Oh, honey,
  you've been out for a while.
          [all laugh]
    A man who's no stranger
           to balls,
        style superstar
        Carson Kressley.
     - I love a good ball.
       Two's even better.
           - [laughs]
     And super-duper model
          Joan Smalls.
     Welcome to my runway.
   - Thank you for having me.
       I'm super excited.
      - You look gorgeous.
      - Trying to keep up
           with you.
         - [deep voice]
       Oh, you gonna need
   a few years for that, son.
     That was my Lady Bunny
         impersonation.
       And the beautiful
        Andie MacDowell.
    You ready for some sex,
    lives and tucking tape?
       - Oh, baby, am I.
        - We're so glad
      you're here tonight.
           This week,
    we challenged our queens
       to turn out three
        gag-worthy looks
   for the gayest ball ever.
       But first, to get
       this ball rolling,
      category is Rhythmic
      Gymnastics A-Go-Go.
           - [laughs]
          - Gentlemen,
       start your engines
  and may the best woman win.
          Representing
        the U.S. of Gay,
        it's the RuPaul
   Rhythmic Gymnastics team.
    [laughter and applause]
   - Hit the showers, girls.
           [applause]
        I think my girls
          are doping.
           - [gasps]
     - Let's get this ball
            rolling.
          Category is
     Rainbow-She-Betta-Do.
     First up, Shea Coulee.
     - Graffiti Nefertiti.
 - I decided to go in a little
  bit of a different direction
         and do a dress
       that is graffiti,
      and I'm just feeling
       this look so much.
       - Tag, you're it.
       [Michelle laughs]
         Sasha Velour.
         Oh, gorgeous.
  - Color blocking perfection.
   - I'm giving a little nod
     to "The Wizard of Oz"
 and the importance of Dorothy
     to the gay community.
             - Oh.
      - Honey, I am home.
   - Careful, before someone
     drops a house on you.
       [Michelle laughs]
          - I'm filing
      for "section great."
          [all laugh]
       - Alexis Michelle.
        - Rainbow Brite.
             - Yes.
          - This look
     is literal Pride flag.
         Bright, loud,
       colorful, stripey.
      -Taste the rainbow.
             -Mmm.
       - Trinity Taylor.
 - That gives whole new meaning
          to strap-on.
  - I'm giving you gay rainbow
   with a dash of dark lady.
      - I wonder what's at
    the end of her rainbow.
     -I just want her ass.
            -Uh-huh.
          [all laugh]
         - Peppermint.
   - Ooh, I wonder if her rug
      matches her drapes.
          [all laugh]
           - My look
    is a classic Pride look.
      I'm a classic beauty
     with a classic booty,
       and I'm working it
    like there is no other.
   - This look brought to you
          by Skittles.
  - Category is Sexy Unicorn.
          Shea Coulee.
     She's the black horse
      of this competition.
      - 50 Shades of Shea.
        - I'm giving you
   dark and lovely stallion.
      You can just call me
         Neigh Coulee.
           -Spank it.
              -Oh.
  Does she make you unicorn-y?
          [all laugh]
         Sasha Velour.
             - Oh.
     - It's the Chronicles
          of Drag-nia.
      -Lord of the Hooves.
             -Yes.
  - When I think of a unicorn,
 I think of medieval tapestry,
      and I'm just selling
      that fantasy beast.
     - The tip of her horn
          is bleeding.
        I think this is
       a period costume.
          [all laugh]
       - Alexis Michelle.
   Now, she's a real hoofer.
       - I am a glittery,
         gold unicorn.
     Look at these hooves.
     You know what they say
  about big hooves, don't you?
   - Now, that's what I call
          a fairytale.
         - She's really
       feeling her oats.
       - Trinity Taylor.
  - She's got so much energy,
     it's like Lisa Crank.
          [all laugh]
      - It's every little
    gay boy's pony fantasy:
    bubblegum, cotton candy,
  My Little Pony, and I live.
         - Yeah, shake
      those tail feathers.
          Peppermint.
         - Horn-raiser.
       - My sexy unicorn
      is a space unicorn.
       I start to realize
        that my garment
       is a little baggy
        in some places,
   so I have to kind of move
      very strategically.
  - Unicorn? I don't remember
        eating unicorn.
       [Michelle laughs]
  - Category is Village People
     Eleganza Extravaganza.
  Serving construction worker
     couture, Shea Coulee.
           You better
       construction work.
       - I deconstructed
a whole bunch of flannel shirts
        to make a cape.
    I got my hair wrapped up
          in a turban
     'cause you do not want
    them edges to sweat out.
    I am feeling invincible.
          - Nailed it.
          [all laugh]
    Serving cowboy couture,
         Sasha Velour.
       - Putting the "ho"
        back in calico.
   - I have this beautifully
  tailored red bandana outfit.
   This, to me, is everything
     I love about fashion.
    - Your country breakfast
           is ready.
    Serving Native American
   couture, Alexis Michelle.
         - Hey, Alexis,
        how's your head?
     - I'm so thrilled with
  how this bodice turned out.
      I feel current, chic
           and I look
    like a million dollars.
       - Well, somebody's
     gonna need an aspirin.
          [all laugh]
     - Serving cop couture,
        Trinity Taylor.
     - I like this because
it goes from daytime to welding
         in one simple
       tilt of the head.
      - I'm feeling strong
           and sexy.
 I'm the bad cop that's coming
   for all the naughty boys.
          Spread 'em.
      - Yeah, she is armed
         and fabulous.
     Serving leather biker
      couture, Peppermint.
         Her safe word
       is "wintergreen."
          [all laugh]
     - I am all decked out
          in leather,
     and, honey, I'm gonna
    make them all my slaves.
   You better call me Master.
            Wha-tch!
    - I think you got a date
        later on, honey.
         <i> - Coming up...</i>
     Ladies, I have to ask,
          who deserves
  to go home tonight and why?
  [RuPaul laughs, bell rings]
       - Welcome, ladies.
         It's time for
     the judges' critiques,
   starting with Shea Coulee.
         - Your rainbow
    was not rainbow at all,
    but it was so stunning.
         - I just felt
 coming out in rainbow stripes
  would have been predictable.
   - Right, but there wasn't
    one color of the rainbow
       in there. Not one.
  - This particular look that
   you're wearing right now,
      I think it's great.
      I love the details.
          But for me,
       the crowning glory
       is that patchwork
   flannel shirt/cape combo.
 - Gives, like, a street style
 model off-duty meets couture,
          and I would
       totally wear that,
           so I hope
    we share the same size.
   - Can we see that jacket?
  Can you spin around for us?
             - Wow.
           -Riveting.
             -Yes.
       - No, that's what
     she was doing earlier.
          [all laugh]
       - Thank you, Shea.
          - Thank you.
    - Up next, Sasha Velour.
       - Let's start with
   your rhythmic gymnastics.
     You had this psychotic
  Dorothy Hamill feel to you.
     You had this plastered
   weird smile on your face.
    It was really well done.
- I'm a little bit in love with
 you in general, I have to say.
  There's something extremely
    modern about your style.
      - This cowboy look,
 the details here are so great.
          Super chic.
        - Your unicorn.
  It was executed flawlessly.
    - And your rainbow look,
I loved when you removed the hat
        and you gave us
   Little House On The Fairy.
       That was amazing.
  - Up next, Alexis Michelle.
      - The gold unicorn,
       I really liked it.
      There was something
    very childlike about it.
       - For the rainbow,
   I feel it was too literal.
   If they give you a theme,
       you should be able
  to take me there, you know.
   And I felt like it needed
 a little bit more of a oomph.
          And you look
     incredibly beautiful,
     but I feel if we take
   the bow out of your head,
     I can get that outfit
          at Ricky's.
       It's a little bit
          lackluster.
   - I would love to see this
    taken way over the top.
           These two,
     they're taking an idea
   and giving it a real twist
   and just going balls deep,
          if you will.
   - This is the final five,
    and there's so much more
   that could have been done.
     - I nearly went blind
      stoning this thing.
           - Got it.
      Still underwhelming.
            - Okay.
   - Up next, Trinity Taylor.
      - The rainbow look.
    Does it look good? Yeah.
         Is it the best
       you could do? No.
       This is more like
   bar Trinity back at home.
       - Let's talk about
   this runway look tonight.
    I think this is so chic
       and so glamorous,
 and all of those little badges
    and pins are phenomenal.
     The hair, the makeup,
  the visor, it's really cool.
         - It's tough.
       At the same time,
         it's feminine.
     The ass looks amazing.
            [laughs]
     I need to take myself
     to the gym after this.
     - No, just the doctor.
          [all laugh]
     - Up next, Peppermint.
        - Your unicorn,
         that was fun,
         but there was
  a little bagginess going on
     in the crotch-al area.
  - The rainbow I really loved
     because it was kind of
          French diva.
     I had an instant flash
       of being in Paris,
    and I wanted to meet you
     in the park at night.
          [all laugh]
       - What did you do
       in France, Andie?
          - In Paris.
      Just call me anytime
 you're going to parties, okay?
- And then, this look, you know,
    the silhouette is great.
    I love all the details.
   - As soon as you came out
the runway, like, you owned it.
        And I felt like
   you were gonna beat me up,
         but I loved it
       at the same time.
         It was, like,
  I just loved the whole idea.
          - Thank you.
- Ladies, at this crucial point
      in the competition,
  I have to ask, who deserves
  to go home tonight and why?
          Let's start
       with Shea Coulee.
     - I would have to say
        Alexis Michelle.
        - Sasha Velour.
            - Alexis
      did really struggle.
   I would have to say Alexis
            as well.
    - Very interesting that
     they're not supportive
      of my look right now
    in front of the judges,
      considering they had
      nothing to say to me
   about it in the workroom.
     Fucking shady whores.
          - All right.
        Alexis Michelle.
           - Frankly,
  I'd have to say Peppermint.
   She has a one-in-a-million
          personality,
  and I think that she's able
         to sell looks
  that aren't always finished.
       - Trinity Taylor,
         same question.
   - A huge pet peeve of mine
    is not paying attention
          to details,
     so I would have to say
          Peppermint.
    - All right, Peppermint.
           Your turn.
       - Probably because
 she is my biggest competition,
        Trinity Taylor.
   - Well, thank you, ladies.
  I think we've heard enough.
  While you untuck backstage,
        the judges and I
        will deliberate.
   All right. So just between
      us squirrel friends,
       what do you think?
 Let's start with Shea Coulee.
           - Overall,
   I love everything she did.
          The unicorn
       was very powerful.
    - Construction couture,
            amazing.
      One of my favorites.
- Her rainbow look did not read
   rainbow to me whatsoever.
   - I could see in the movie
      "Paris Is Burning,"
  people would be on the floor
           shouting,
   it is not a rainbow dress!
            - I get
    what everyone is saying,
       but the fact that
she included makeup on her body,
    it was like an artwork.
         - Shea Coulee
     came here to compete,
  and she knows how to do it.
         Sasha Velour.
     - I love Sasha because
    I think she's original.
     - She gave us rainbow
   in a really different way,
      and the unicorn look
    stood out from the herd.
          [all laugh]
          I just think
      she's chic as fuck.
       - Her cowboy look
   was absolutely beautiful,
    but it was more fashion
       than it was drag.
         - Yeah, I come
     to<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i>
  not just to see a look that
    I'm going to go to Paris
       and I can see that
         down a runway.
      Like, I just needed
   to be taken to that dream,
       that fantasy land.
     - You know, I'm torn,
  because everything Sasha did
   was absolutely fantastic.
      But is it gag-worthy
          for a ball?
         We're looking
    for the Harlem children
  to be saying, you are over.
         You are over.
   Miss Thing, you are over.
        Alexis Michelle.
   - Her rhythmic gymnastics
             thing,
      she just had so much
       enthusiasm for it
      and she gave us like
 Mary Lou Retton 1986 realness.
   - Every time she came out
         on the stage,
    I was just so captivated
         by her beauty.
      But everything else
   kind of like fell through.
 - To me, that Native American
     fell completely short.
         So many things
      she could have done
   to make it so much better
     and so much draggier.
   And it looked like a shake
and go that she had on tonight.
         - The look was
    a little bit pedestrian.
- Again, we have to look at this
    as this is the top five
   and this is when you bring
    the best that you have.
             - Yes.
       - Trinity Taylor.
      - The rainbow look,
  that was a real miss for me.
      We need wow factor.
        I want that look
        to be an event,
       and that was like
         an appetizer.
       - And the unicorn,
     it wasn't my favorite,
      but I still thought
      it was a lot of fun.
   - Even though her unicorn
      wasn't that special,
       she sold the fuck
       out of that thing.
        - Yeah, she did.
   - Her final look, however,
       was so fantastic.
      Everything about it,
         from the hair
       down to the bottom
      just worked for me.
        - Pep, Pep, Pep.
     What's up, Peppermint?
        - I don't think
      she was a stand out
   in the rhythmic gymnastics
            number.
   I didn't notice if she did
   a great job or a bad job.
     I just didn't notice.
       That's a problem.
  - Her unicorn was definitely
    out of her comfort zone.
  She had a "Hellraiser" thing
    going on with her head,
          and the idea
   was very forward thinking.
  - But it kind of was ruined
       because the pieces
      didn't fit properly.
      - But the last look,
    I felt like she owned it
   and it was so intimidating
      and just empowering.
    - And I love the way she
 commanded the runway with it.
       She was connecting
        with all of us.
         You could tell
      that she was living.
           - Silence.
     I've made my decision.
           Bring back
       my Village People.
           - [laughs]
  [RuPaul laughs, bell rings]
    - Welcome back, ladies.
   I've made some decisions.
Sasha Velour, your three fashion
   looks really roped us in.
  Shea Coulee, your three ball
    looks gagged the judges.
          Shea Coulee,
       con-drag-ulations.
       You're the winner
   of this week's challenge.
           [applause]
   You've won two VIP tickets
     to<i> Cirque Du Soleil's</i>
  sexy adult cabaret<i> Zumanity,</i>
  including airfare and deluxe
   Las Vegas accommodations.
             - Yes!
     Being in the top four
         feels so good.
    I am feeling invincible.
  - Sasha Velour, you're safe.
          - Thank you.
         - You may step
   to the back of the stage.
       - Alexis Michelle,
  your Native American couture
        left the judges
       with reservations.
    I'm sorry, my dear, but
  you are up for elimination.
- I'm pretty angry being placed
  in the bottom for this week.
     Frankly, I think what
  I'm wearing is more fashion
       than what Trinity
  and Peppermint are wearing.
       - Trinity Taylor,
        your cop rocked,
      but your other looks
     weren't as arresting.
          Peppermint,
 your leather queen dominated,
  but your unicorn and rainbow
      were a little light
        in the loafers.
Peppermint, I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.
  Trinity Taylor, you're safe.
          You may join
        the other girls.
Ladies, this is your last chance
         to impress me
       and save yourself
       from elimination.
      The time has come...
           [thunder]
          to lip synch
    [echoing] for your life.
           Good luck
     and don't fuck it up.

           <i> Hey! Hey!</i>
      <i> Hey, hey, hey, hey!</i>

         <i> Hey, hey, hey!</i>
     [cheers and applause]
           - Ladies,
     I've made my decision.
          Peppermint,
       shantay, you stay.
          You may join
        the other girls.
          - Thank you.
       - Alexis Michelle,
   to misquote Liza Minnelli,
    if you can make it here,
   you can make it anywhere.
          - [sobbing]
       Thank you so much.
       - Now sashay away.
          - Thank you.
           [applause]
      Dream big, my girls.
   I'm not really surprised.
     It just wasn't my day.
      I know it looks like
         I'm super sad,
     and the truth is I am.
  I mean, it's hard to go home
     right before the end.
          But I think
    what I'm really feeling
     is this was something
    I wanted for so, so long
     and I'm finally here.
       I've learned that
     I have what it takes.
        Let this statue
     be the first of many.
          You like me.
      You really like me.
      - Well, look at you,
          my fab four.
       Con-drag-ulations.
         And remember,
  if you can't love yourself,
    how in the hell are you
   going love somebody else?
           Can I get
      an amen up in here?
             -Amen!
             -Amen!
   - Now let the music play.


          <i> - Previously</i>
    <i> on</i> RuPaul's Drag Race...
         You will create
       your own TV pilot.
              -Oh!
            -Action.
     - See you next Tuesday.
       - [Russian accent]
   At midnight, motherfucker.
          [both laugh]
     - We're gonna play off
     each other's adlibbing.
    - Oh, you're gonna adlib?
       - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
       - We need to become
          drag queens!
        - [laughs] Okay.
      - Do you think maybe
   a script would have helped?
      - The clever wordplay
         and the writing
    I do think came from me.
      - I have to speak up
           right now.
      That is not the case.
         - Sasha Velour,
          Shea Coulee,
        you're the winner
    of this week's challenge.
            Valentina
     and Nina Bo'nina Brown,
   you are up for elimination.
     Stop. Hold up, hold up.
       Valentina, this is
    a lip sync for your life.
    We need to see your lips.
         Take that thing
       off of your mouth.
           - I'd like
     to keep it on, please.
       - It's a lip sync.
        What part of that
     do you not understand?
       Nina Bo'nina Brown,
       shantay, you stay.
     Valentina, sashay away.
             - Girl.
      - What just happened?
           - Valentina
      was just eliminated,
     and we are all shocked.
          - "I love you
      with all of my heart.
            Kisses."
        - Oh, Valentina.
        - Oh, Valentina.
    - I'm so stunned, though.
          I don't know
     what got into her head.
     - But that being said,
     Nina, you earned that.
            Not only
     did you know the words,
            you like
       put on a fun show.
         -Come on, Nina.
           -Go, Nina.
  [chanting] Nina! Nina! Nina!
  - Yeah, I mean, it was cute.
     I did what I had to do.
   But for me, this is, like,
   not, like, a happy moment.
        I feel horrible.
           I feel bad
    because I feel like maybe
          if she wasn't
      in the group with me,
          she probably
      would still be here.
              -No.
           -No, Nina.
    - You can't take that on,
              girl.
     That ain't your fault.
          - Oh, my God.
           Not again.
       - I'm just saying,
      hear me out, y'all--
   before y'all curse me out,
 the negative one is still here
     and the positive one--
          - But, Nina,
     we're rooting for you.
    The way you just fought,
       that was beautiful.
  - Yeah, but I just feel bad.
          - It's tough
      being in the bottom,
          but is there
      a little piece of you
      that feels victorious
           after this?
              - No.
       I can't explain it.
       I can't explain it.
      - Can we stop talking
      about this, actually?
           -This is--
             -Sorry,
         I'm not having
       this conversation.
           I love you.
    That's all I have to say.
    I've never heard of that
  in any situation in humanity.
  I need to make you feel good
         about the fact
    that you did a great job?
     So I'm not gonna do it.
           Bitch, snap
       the fuck out of it.
 - I guess I don't really care,
that's the thing, like I should,
          but I don't.
         I'm not asking
    for anybody to go, like,
      oh, Nina, it's okay.
         I mean, that's
     what they chose to do.
     - We've asked ourselves
         how many times
           did we try
    to snap her out of this,
  and the answer is it's over.
      - These conversations
  are not helping her, clearly.
           It may even
      be doing more damage.
   This is not group therapy.
     This is a competition.
         We just cannot
          fight for her
 in a way that she's not willing
      to fight for herself.
      I'm tired of spending
         all of our time
       together as a group
   trying to build someone up
  who doesn't want to hear it.
          I am over it.
       - That doesn't mean
     we don't support Nina,
    but it's time to move on.
    I'm over it, I'm over it,
          I'm over it.
      She needs to go home.
           No, no, no.
          I'm over it.
       [car engine starts]
          - The winner
      of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i>
   receives a one year supply
   of Anastasia Beverly Hills
            cosmetics
        and a cash prize
          of $100,000.
       With extra special
          guest judges
     Emmy nominated designed
              Zaldy
           and Kesha.
              -Oh.
          -Another day.
          -We're back.
             -Whoo!
       - Top six, bitches.
              Yes.
     - Hello, hello, hello.
      [cheers and applause]
           - It's Ru.
       - Now, in the past,
    I've challenged my queens
           to do some
    pretty special makeovers.
          Gay veterans,
        Stonewall heroes,
        and Little Women,
       just to name a few.
         But this season
     promises to be the most
    extra special one of all.
    And we don't have to look
           any further
  than just behind the camera.
         For this week's
         maxi challenge,
        you'll be giving
    our beloved crew members
   the chance to strut a mile
        in your shoes...
    [laughter and screaming]
   In a makeover sponsored by
    Anastasia Beverly Hills.
            Oh, crew?
           [all laugh]
    Now who do I want to see
    all prettied up in drag?
             Sarge.
           [all laugh]
             Aaron.
      [cheers and applause]
             Rizzo.
     [laughter and applause]
    Brady, come on over here.
     [laughter and applause]
              Josh.
             - Yes!
     - Okay, just one more.
             Duncan.
     [screams and laughter]
    Gentlemen, say your name
        and what you do.
          - I'm Sarge.
     I'm a camera operator.
           - I'm Aaron
   and I'm an art coordinator.
          - I'm Rizzo.
        I am a set P.A.,
        and I pretty much
 make sure that they're in drag
        when we tell them
         to be in drag.
      - Oh, how the tables
          have turned.
           [all laugh]
       - My name's Brady.
 I work in the audio department,
         and I make sure
          you all sound
    as beautiful as you look
         every episode.
             -Aw...
             -Aw...
         - Hey, queens.
        My name is Josh.
       You see me around.
           I'm a P.A.
          - I'm Duncan.
   I'm the associate director.
    We're all in Ru's house.
       When Ru's not here,
         it's my house.
           [all laugh]
       - Ladies, these men
     are like family to me.
         Now I want you
       to share with them
            firsthand
      the miracle of drag.
        #RuCrewMakeovers
           [all laugh]
  And we've got these gorgeous
          RockStar wigs
       to top things off.
 Shea and Sasha, since you both
   won last week's challenge,
   you get to pair the queens
         with the crew.
    First, who do you choose
         for yourselves?
           Shea first.
             - Josh.
           - Oh, damn!
         - I picked Josh
        because obviously
      we share the closest
       family resemblance.
        - I like a strong
       and powerful woman,
    so I'm going with Duncan.
           [all laugh]
      I feel like Duncan's
           so serious
    when he's being our A.D.,
        and I want to see
        his playful side.
             - Nina,
     we're going to pair you
        with the lovely,
         artistic Aaron.
          - All right.
  - Ain't no shenanigans here.
          We really try
     and match the girls up
        with someone that
       at least feels like
        their personality
       will match up well.
       - With Peppermint,
      we are putting Sarge.
     [laughter and applause]
       - Who do you choose
          for Trinity?
             -Rizzo.
             -Rizzo.
     [laughter and applause]
      - Which means Alexis
   will be making over Brady.
           [applause]
         -Come to mama.
              -Yes.
        - Now, remember,
   the judges will be looking
          for a strong
    drag family resemblance.
      So don't fuck it up.
          - So you said
        you're an artist.
    - I'm a graphite artist,
   you know, outside of work,
   you know, a pencil artist.
       - 'Cause I do drag,
    but I don't just do drag.
       I do like artistic
  and different kind of things.
       - Dope. I dig this.
        Do you want to do
       like creature like?
     - Yeah. I'm thinking--
     - I think that would be
          fucking cool.
 - And I keep having this vision
     of like a white rabbit.
          - Hell, yeah.
       - But the thing is
  getting the garment together.
          That's where
       the trick comes in.
     Y'all know I don't sew.
             For me,
       my drag is my face,
    but I wanted to show that
       I can try to create
     something from scratch.
       So I decide to sew.
            [laughs]
             - Hip.
        - One of my major
      inspirations for drag
       is Naomi Campbell.
   That strength, that power,
        that confidence.
    So, like, what are some,
    like, female celebrities
    that, like, come to mind
     when you're just, like,
    I like the way she looks
         when I see her
       on the red carpet?
        - I have a thing
      for Natalie Portman.
       - Natalie Portman?
     She don't really match
     with the Coulee brand.
   I want you to just give me,
  like, your best runway walk.
         Let me have it.
        I know your mama
      don't walk like that.
    Don't think about putting
 the emphasis in your shoulders.
      Take all that energy
         and channel it
         into your hips.
    You really want to, like,
  loosen, like, all of this up.
        So try it again.
       I'm gonna watch you
          from behind.
   - Have you ever seen a dog
          walk in snow?
             - Ooh.
     - It's just like that.
    Your sister looks strong.
        - She is strong.
        - And I'm talking
        about that walk.
           - [laughs]
          - Bye, girl.
         <i> - Coming up...</i>
     Oh, and one more thing.
   [RuPaul laughs, bell rings]
         [RuPaul laughs]
           - Oh, fuck.
        - Walk naturally.
        Go to the store.
        - Okay. Oh, God.
          - Oh, Jesus.
  - This week's maxi challenge
           is to turn
      the "Drag Race" crew
     into our drag sisters.
    Okay, I'm known for body,
     so I would like to make
       a swimsuit for you.
         How do you feel
         about tucking?
          - Gonna hurt.
     - But with a swimsuit,
  it's, like, it's very there.
     You gotta pull it back
          or I'm gonna
      pull it back for you.
             - Oh...
          - With Rizzo,
    I'm gonna crack the whip.
    I haven't won a challenge
         in a few weeks,
   and so I have to work hard
          and show them
        that I'm gonna go
          all the way.
       - Hey, kitty girls.
              -Hey.
              -Hey.
           - How's my
       2 Live Crew doing?
             -Good.
             -Good.
           - [laughs]
           Hey, Brady.
    - Well, hello there, Ru.
          -Hi, Alexis.
              -Hi.
   - Now, you've just sort of
   dipped your toe in so far.
     What personality traits
          are emerging?
 - Oh, the bitch and the diva's
       already coming out.
            - Really?
   - You know, we're supposed
 to adopt the same personality.
     I think it's happening
           naturally.
        - Well, like I've
     always said, you know,
  drag actually reveals your--
      I knew I was powerful
            in drag.
      It didn't occur to me
    that I could utilize that
   in other areas of my life.
    - So you telling me that
   I'm co-hosting next season?
           - [laughs]
           - Fuck you,
        Michelle Visage.
       We don't need you.
             - Aah!
             Oh, no!
    - I know your girlfriend
    is a big fan of the show.
  Is that why you're doing it?
      - No. I mean, before
   I started working with you,
    I really kind of thought
        that it was just
   a man dressed like a woman
    and that kind of was it.
     But I'm starting to see
    all the different aspects
       of drag or others,
       the comedic drags,
           and there's
      like the runway drags
          and the fish.
              -Yes.
    -That's a new one for me.
    That was new this season.
            - Uh-huh.
 - There's no way I could say no
      to this opportunity.
   - Now, Alexis, you were in
   the bottom three last week.
         - Yes. I don't
     want to be there again,
   and I know that we're going
  to put our best foot forward.
  - We're already a good team.
          - All right.
        Get back to work.
            -Will do.
           -Thank you.
       - Well, well, well.
        Duncan and Sasha.
      Now, you're cinched.
       How does that feel?
        - Feels good, Ru.
          - [all laugh]
       - She's a natural.
      - Now, you have a boy
           and a girl.
         I've met them.
         They're lovely.
   What's your family going to
   think about daddy in drag?
        - I think my son
   will probably have pointers
     on how I walk in heels.
        Since he was two,
    he loves clomping around
       in my wife's, so...
      - It is so much fun.
        If I had a daddy
      who was brave enough
      to use all the colors
       in the crayon box,
      that would have been
         life changing.
      So thank you so much.
   - I want to do RuPaul proud
    with my Duncan makeover.
         The two of them
        have a great love
   and respect for each other,
     and so I really, really
       cannot disappoint.
  - Now, Duncan, you have seen
     the queens come and go
      for years and years.
           What advice
      have you given Sasha?
      - To try and stay out
        of your own head.
              - Mm.
        - We talked about
 over-intellectualizing things,
   and that getting in the way
       of just being free.
      - How do you do that?
            - Drugs.
   - You know, I'm pretty sure
       this is going to be
           my favorite
    all-time challenge ever.
       -Can't wait, Sasha.
          -I'm excited.
         - Turn it out.
     - Right. I know we both
   have the same battle here.
           - Gorgeous.
       - Oh, my goodness.
        - Oh, hello, Ru.
          How are you?
      - I am over the moon.
         Sarge, how long
       have you been here?
        - Since Season 4.
   - You know, you and I joke.
   Sometimes I'll shoot a look
          over to you,
    and there's an intellect
    and there's a fun energy
      that comes from you.
    - I would agree with you
            tenfold.
       I definitely caught
       a really open vibe
     from Sarge right away.
     - Yeah. I've never seen
      any sort of judgment
      about our girls here.
        - No, no, no, no.
         Absolutely not.
         I never thought
     before doing this show
  I would have as much respect
    for drag queens as I do.
            I'm just
      absolutely flattered
     to be able to document
     those life experiences.
     - Now, how did you get
         the name Sarge?
       - I was a sergeant
          in the army.
        - Well, if you've
    been through all of that,
           doing drag
       is a piece of cake.
             -Uh-uh.
              -No?
            - Huh-uh.
           [all laugh]
    I'm scared shitless, Ru.
   - I think you'll be great.
         But, you know,
    we're in the home stretch
      of this competition.
      Gotta bring it, mama.
   - I'm gonna bring it hard,
              girl.
             - Okay.
     I can't wait to see it.
   - I can't wait to show you.
          - Say it with
   a little more sass, honey.
      - Girl, I cannot wait
          to show you.
           [all laugh]
    -I can't wait to see it.
             -Okay.
          -How'd I do?
 -You did great. You did great.
         She's into you.
      - All right, ladies,
          gather round.
      Gather round, ladies.
   Now, tomorrow, in addition
  to your runway presentation,
        you and your new
         sisters in drag
         need to prepare
     a lip sync performance
    to my song "Click Clack."
     [screams and laughter]
      So don't fuck it up.
         - Oh, Trinity,
        I didn't realize
      that you were serving
      some shrimp cocktail
       with your makeover.
          That's cute.
        - You worry about
     your man's feet, okay?
      You don't worry about
     our man's feet, honey.
        - One could wear,
         like, overalls,
     and then I could have,
         like, a hoodie.
   It shouldn't be that hard.
       - Nina wants to sew
 two whole outfits from scratch,
            and Nina
     don't know how to sew.
   Hey, I'm all for ambition,
     but ambition is nothing
       without execution.
        - Ah, here we go.
        Yeah, I'm having
        a hard time here.
    - Oh, I just hope we can
    execute this right, man.
       Don't curse me out.
         No, I'm sorry.
      No, I apologize, no.
     If you can just show me
   how to thread the machine,
      then I'm good, y'all.
             - Okay.
     Even though me and Nina
         had our moment,
     I still feel for Nina,
       so I'm here to help
        as much as I can.
     But I got to help Josh.
       - Let me watch this
           completely.
           - And then
      you just hit the gas,
   and it'll spin the bobbin.
         - Oh, I got it.
           Thank you.
        Okay, here we go.
     - This is the top six.
      This is not the time
      to learn how to sew,
  especially when you're having
   to make two of everything.
       - Am I even on it?
            Oh, shit.
         <i> - Coming up...</i>
            - [sighs]
        Fuck, this hurts.
          - What the--
      Get the--out of here.
           - [laughs]
   [RuPaul laughs, bell rings]
         [RuPaul laughs]
          - Yes. Work.
   - I'm just gonna tighten it
         one more time.
             - Okay.
          -Oh, my God.
     -Hold on tight, Sarge.
  Our maxi challenge this week
         is to make over
    the crew of "Drag Race."
           - [groans]
         - That's great.
 You're walking like Pearl now.
         That's perfect.
         He looks stoned
      and very fashionable.
      I was a little scared
            of Duncan
      'cause he's so strict
            with us.
           But Duncan
     is feeling the fantasy.
            - Mm-hmm.
       - Oh, my goodness.
   Look at those little shoes.
   These are real drag heels.
            [laughs]
   - Oh, yeah, Sarge? Uh-huh?
 - Mommy's taking you to church
       for the first time?
        Working with him,
        it's amazing how
   I'm not in my head at all.
   I haven't had this much fun
      or felt this relaxed.
         - Whoo-hoo-hoo!
  It's like The Little Mermaid.
    -It's The Little Mermaid.
            -Exactly.
  - Except she was a big dude.
           [all laugh]
      - See, that was good.
         That was shade.
             - Okay.
           [all laugh]
          - So you got
        your foot pedal.
        - But this needs
          to come down.
         - That's, uh...
          I don't know.
       Does the foot pedal
      bring it down or no?
   - Yeah, this thing is like
      jammed or something.
     -Do you wanna ask the--
      -I can't ask anybody.
  It's like everybody's so into
   their own thing right now.
   - I don't know what to say,
          to be honest.
             We used
     all our lifelines here.
            - Right.
           - For help.
    - Now it's kind of like,
   bitch, you're on your own.
  Aaron didn't feel confident,
         and it finally
         got to a point
        where I was like,
         you know what?
     This ain't gonna work.
     It's not going to work.
      So we need to change
          our outfits.
       It's sad. I thought
 I was finally sewing something.
     - This is gonna be fun
            for you.
       - Yeah, The reason
  I particularly was doing this
           was because
    I've never really agreed
     with how we've divided
          men and women
          when it comes
        to what's strong.
         So to me, like,
    this is very encouraging
    to anyone who doesn't fit
     in that specific mold.
             -Right.
     -I know what it's like
   to kind of not particularly
       fit the jock mold.
   That to me is not what I've
  placed value of strength in.
  It's like beauty and strength
     are kind of synonymous,
           and I think
    you need to be surrounded
           by numerous
    different walks of life.
       Otherwise you just
      will never understand
         certain aspects
         of this world.
           - Exactly.
    I'm definitely surprised
     by talking with Rizzo.
      I feel the same way.
       Being a human being
         is so much more
    than being put into a box
           or a label.
      You are who you are.
             -Yeah.
            -New day.
         We have to get
    our crew members shaved,
       paint their faces,
   get them in their dresses,
     and also get ourselves
      completely into drag,
      and there is no time.
       - Nina, in the last
     previous two episodes,
 you were on the bottom, right?
            - Mm-hmm.
      - What got you there,
            you feel?
  - Um, it's been a challenge.
    - I think my vibe with it
   is what's keeping you down
          is yourself.
   That's what I get off you.
         Even yesterday,
     you talk yourself down
       almost to the point
    of jeopardizing yourself.
             -Right.
           -You know?
         No matter what,
      people are trying to
    encourage you, you know.
     It's just like one ear,
          out the other
     or your fucking pride's
         in front of you
           or you just
        too blind to see.
   - And after a while, people
     can't keep telling you,
     you know, you're great.
    Being my own worst enemy
    is like-it's a struggle.
  It is. And no matter how many
   people tell me you're good
     and we're here for you,
    I'm not gonna believe it
       until I believe it
           for myself.
      It's just...it's me.
     - Because you've always
    been this way growing up?
      - Yeah, I have just--
          I don't know.
    I've been through a lot.
           Depression
       is a serious thing.
        - Mm-hmm, I know.
         I was addicted
         to pain killers
     because I liked the way
       they made me feel.
      It just made me happy
          all the time.
             -Right.
 -Because I also get in my head
    and I get depressed and--
    But I feel more confident
          in who I am.
       When I got clean...
            - Right.
       - What does Ru say
    at the end of an episode?
         - If you can't
         love yourself?
      - Yeah, how the hell
  you gonna love anybody else?
            [laughs]
     Sue me. Right. [laughs]
        You know, people
        are on your side
        more than I think
       you think you know.
       - It's a hard thing
          to overcome,
   but with this competition,
      before it's too late,
    I really hope I can find
         the magic in me
       that I know I have
       and really just be
     a truly happier person
        so that it shows
         on the outside.
     That looks really good,
             like--
         - Yeah, look at
         the both of us.
       - So go back there,
     take off your underwear
      that you have on now,
          put those on.
             - Okay.
   - And then like I told you,
      pull everything back,
           wedgie it.
            - Right.
      - And then we'll see
   if we need a piece of tape.
           For anybody
       in my drag family,
       the number one rule
        is a fierce tuck.
     - Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.
        - How's it going?
  - I don't think it--come on.
      - You ain't supposed
    to be playing tug-o-war.
      - Fuck. I mean flip.
          I mean ouch.
    - Not a wrestling match.
      You haven't even got
   to the duct tape part yet.
            -Hold on!
            -[laughs]
    Ball keeps, like, trying
to poke out more than the other.
     -We're gonna use tape.
            -Damn it!
    - We planned the costume
          around this.
      The judges know that
     I can do a fierce tuck.
      This has to be right.
        Okay, let me see.
              - Uh.
            - I mean,
      it's not great still,
        so we're gonna do
         another piece.
             - Okay.
    - [imitates tearing tape]
        - Ow! This hurts.
           What the--
      Get the--out of here!
         [RuPaul laughs]
             - Yay!
   - Welcome to the main stage
     of<i> RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>
    My BFF on and off camera,
        Michelle Visage.
       - Besties forever.
         - The hilarious
          Ross Mathews.
        - To show support
    for all our crew members,
     [grunts] I wore heels.
           [all laugh]
     - My favorite designer,
             Zaldy.
     - I'm so happy you wore
      that dress for today.
        You know it says
         "sashay away,"
   all your phrases on there.
      - You are kidding me?
          In Japanese?
              -Yes.
          -I love that.
        And the stunning
    and super talented Kesha.
        - I'm so excited
         to be here, Ru.
     - So glad you're here.
           This week,
    we challenged our queens
          to make over
 our hard-working crew members.
  And as an act of solidarity,
         the entire crew
  is working in wigs and heels.
              - Oh!
          Yes, queens.
          - Gentlemen,
       start your engines,
             and may
       the best woman win.
         <i> - Coming up...</i>
     - It's just really fun
           to look at.
  - I really, really loved it.
       - I was blown away.
            - Really?
   [RuPaul laughs, bell rings]
         [RuPaul laughs]
        - Category is...
           Let's meet
        the new Ru crew.
    First up, Trinity Taylor
       and Glittafa Dayz.
      Ladies and gentlemen,
       the Cheetah Girls.
             -Whoo!
              -Oh.
         - Glittafa Dayz
    looks like a true Taylor.
  This tuck is fucking fierce.
      - I think the store's
       all out of Aquanet.
          - Are we sure
     this is his first time?
           [all laugh]
          - Shea Coulee
         and Bae Coulee.
        Oh, it's Beyonce
          and Solange.
           - Oh, yes.
        - I am terrified.
           This runway
     is a bit of a disaster.
     But I helped my sister
         the best I can
         and get my ass
        off that runway.
      - Looks like a pump.
         - Yes, it does.
        - Alexis Michelle
     and Rye Anne Stardust.
     - Looks like Barbarella
             to me.
     - I hear they both give
         good headband.
         - Those glutes
     are made for stomping.
        [Michelle laughs]
       - My little sister
         and I's pussies
       are defying gravity
         in outer space.
          - Judy Jetson
  and her sister Booty Jetson.
           [all laugh]
       Nina Bo'nina Brown
    and Ariana Bo'nina Brown.
   - I wonder where she's got
           her carrot?
           [all laugh]
       - From head to toe,
        we have the ears,
     the teeth and the face.
       We are S&M bunnies.
        You know, fierce.
   - I can see a little hare.
             -Mm-mm.
            -Get it?
          - Yeah, yeah.
   - That's a bunny reference.
       - This is her hare.
      She don't wear weave.
            - Mm-mm.
         - Sasha Velour
      and Dunatella Velour.
            That hat
      is on my bucket list.
           [all laugh]
 - We're two East Coast sisters
          in the 1940s
     looking to make it big
          in Hollywood.
    I think these are really,
    really fashionable looks,
          and Dunatella
        looks beautiful.
             - Love.
             -Aw...
             -Aw...
     - Wait. Wait a minute.
              -Oh.
             -What?
            - Velour.
           - That look
     really said something.
      - What label whores.
  Peppermint and Winter Green.
         -A sleeve belt.
             -Yeah.
   - I think she's got a trick
         up her sleeve.
       - Sleeve her alone.
       - We're sashaying,
        we're shantaying,
      and Ms. Winter Green,
        she's feeling it.
      I'm like, okay, girl.
       - She's sleeving on
 the Midnight Train to Georgia.
           [all laugh]
     - You have the best job
          in the world.
            -I know.
            -So fun.
     - The time has come...
            [thunder]
       for you to lip sync
          for your job.
          Just kidding.
            Sort of.
          [music plays]
             - Whoo!
           [all laugh]
              - Oh!
           [all laugh]
             -Whoo!
             -Whoo!
      [cheers and applause]
         <i> - Coming up...</i>
         - It feels like
  a Ricky's Halloween costume.
    - I need you to bring it
            at a 10.
           - It's time
        to really dig in.
   [RuPaul laughs, bell rings]
         [RuPaul laughs]
       - Welcome, ladies.
            It's time
   for the judges' critiques.
    First up, Trinity Taylor
       and Glittafa Dayz.
    - The family resemblance
        is hard to deny,
      and you did the most
     intricate choreography.
     - Yeah, so impressive.
        I can barely walk
         in those shoes,
     let alone, like, dance.
           -Glittafa.
           -Glittafa.
   - If I didn't know better,
   it'd look like you've been
    doing this for a minute.
     - But beyond, I think,
     having a great partner,
         it's about how
   you communicate and guide,
  and I think this was probably
   the tightest presentation.
     -Is that code for tuck?
         -Yes, exactly.
        - How's your tuck
           holding up?
       - The pain is real.
        The pain is real.
 - Now, what do you think you're
gonna take from this experience?
        - I'm gonna take
         this tape off.
           [all laugh]
     - Up next, Shea Coulee
     and here is Bae Coulee.
      - I love the dresses,
    like, kind of old school
         Hollywood glam.
     - But there's something
 about this attention to detail
   and about paying attention
         to your sister.
  - Bae, when she turns around,
   you could see her hairline.
         Her bra straps
    are hanging out the back.
     It felt like, you know,
     there's the star sister
        and then there's
        the other sister.
          - Oh. I hate
      that it came across,
         like, you know,
    Bae was an afterthought.
         - I think Shea
        did a great job.
   I'm proud to be her sister.
              -Aw.
              -Aw.
   - Up next, Alexis Michelle
     and Rye Anne Stardust.
    - Your brows are glitter.
     That's fucking awesome.
       - The nails scream
          I am a slut.
     - Big voluptuous slut.
        - But the outfits
     are kind of real basic.
     - It feels a little bit
         like a Ricky's
   Halloween costume in a bag.
          - Look, we're
      intergalactic whores.
     Can we have some candy,
            you know?
      Look how close we are
        to the end here.
   It's time to really dig in.
  - Up next, Nina Bo'nina Brown
           Faye Bakker
    and Ariana Bo'nina Brown.
     - Well, I love animals,
  so I think it's really cute.
           [all laugh]
          I really do.
    - Now, was it challenging
 doing this drag transformation
           in front of
        your co-workers?
         - No. In fact,
    the teams were so sweet,
     and the art department,
      they made little tags
      that said Team Aaron,
   you know what I mean? So...
              -Aw.
              -Aw.
      - Well, we always say
  a family that drags together,
         slays together.
     - But this is kind of,
   you know, a letdown for me.
 It's you out here in a leotard
      with thigh-high boots
      and not really doing
      anything innovative.
         I was screaming
     for a little cottontail
    or a little colored glove
          or something
   just to bring this to this
         so there wasn't
     such a disconnect here.
        - And then, with
      the performance, too,
   I thought was a little bit
         underwhelming.
  - I'm so excited by what you
bring to this competition, Nina,
         but I need you
      to bring it at a 10.
     - Up next, Sasha Velour
      and Dunatella Velour.
          - This looks
        so high fashion.
          It looks like
        Miu Miu on acid.
  - The proportion of the dress
          and the coat
  and all these pops of color,
   I really, really loved it.
   - Now, Dunatella, there is
   something that you're doing
        that's strangely
         turning me on.
         - I learned it
    from watching you, dear.
           [all laugh]
      - Up next, Peppermint
        and Winter Green.
            Gorgeous.
            - I know.
           [all laugh]
    - Winter Green, your face
       is just really fun
           to look at.
      You're just so funny.
        I don't know why.
  But you're, like, beautiful,
    but, like, you make me--
 but, like, you're beautiful...
           [all laugh]
       - What is it, dear?
           [all laugh]
       - Let me roll back.
        You just look...
            - Go on.
           [all laugh]
         - I just can't.
        - But the outfits
       clash so horribly,
    I don't even want to look
   at them in the same frame.
        - But guess what?
      I don't care because
    you were so fun to watch.
        - And Peppermint,
 you should thank Winter Green,
     because she was the one
     who pulled you through.
   - Now, Winter Green, do you
think you'll ever do drag again?
          - Who knows?
           Season 10?
           [all laugh]
         - "All Stars."
       Thank you, ladies.
         And to my crew
       standing on stage,
     to see you men do this,
   it says that we as a people
       are moving forward,
       and it's beautiful.
         Thank you from
     the bottom of my heart.
      Now, while you ladies
        untuck backstage,
        the judges and I
        will deliberate.
       [car engine starts]
           All right.
   So just between us squirrel
   friends, what do you think?
         Trinity Taylor
       and Glittafa Dayz.
       - They had the most
    incredible choreography.
         The whole look,
         the attitudes,
         like, I bought
  everything they had to sell.
    - It was just so apparent
      that their connection
   was, like, on another level
      than anybody else's.
  - Yeah, and you know, Zaldy,
   Trinity is a real showgirl,
     so to teach her sister
          that routine
 and for her to hit it so hard,
        very impressive.
      - In those heels, Ru.
        - In those heels.
      Shea and Bae Coulee.
      - Shea kind of failed
         for me tonight.
    She let her sister down.
      - In Shea's defense,
    I felt like she did come
       to her sister's aid
    when she saw the problems
            going on.
          And I thought
      she looked beautiful.
      - Shea has wowed us.
   Tonight, that was not wow.
  - But is what Shea did reason
enough to put her in the bottom?
          -Not for me.
       -To me, yes, 100%.
          -Not for you?
              -No.
   - Not to me. I didn't think
     her look was the worst.
I didn't think their performance
         was the worst.
       I would put Alexis.
            - Not me.
    - That's who I would put
         in the bottom.
          - All right.
     Let's talk about Alexis
     and Rye Anne Stardust.
        - Something about
      how unfresh this was.
     It was hard for me to,
     like, really enjoy it.
       - Though it was not
        my favorite look,
       it was meticulously
          put together.
      - But I was at least
    a little more interested
          in what Shea
      brought to the table
     than I was with Alexis.
            - Really?
       Shea's was sloppy.
    This one was not sloppy.
             - Well,
     Michelle knows sloppy.
           [all laugh]
      - I feel like Alexis
          and Rye Anne,
     even if you don't like
         the aesthetic,
but I do find them more original
     than just frumpy gowns.
      - Thank you. Tonight,
   toilet paper, paper towel.
      - [laughs] All right.
So let's move on to Nina Bo'nina
  Brown Tyler Moore and Ariana.
   - That bunny had absolutely
  no connection with the rest.
     And we've been getting
       the same silhouette
         with a bodysuit
      and thigh-high boots.
        I'm done with it.
             - Yeah.
       Even the bunny part
   was just sort of half done.
     - And, like, the ears,
         it looked like
     they'd been rained on.
   - It's more arts and crafts
      than it is Comic-Con.
         - Sasha Velour
      and Dunatella Velour.
       - I really enjoyed
         the connection
    between the two of them.
        And are her looks
    always so modern-feeling?
      - She's very fashion.
            - Because
    it really worked for me.
    - She's been so serious,
       but she looked like
         she was really
   enjoying herself this week.
       -Really letting go.
             -Yeah.
        - I'm super proud
        of Sasha tonight.
          - Peppermint
        and Winter Green.
   - I think we can all agree
             tonight
        that Winter Green
          gets the MVP.
           [all laugh]
       She's a superstar.
         From the minute
       she came out here,
          I bought it.
  The only think I did not buy
       was those outfits.
      - So hard to look at.
 Just the choice in the fabrics,
     they felt so disparate.
 - Peppermint better be kissing
      Winter Green's feet.
             Because
     if it weren't for her,
     I could see Peppermint
    in the bottom this week.
      - All right, silence.
   You've been no help at all.
           [all laugh]
      Bring back my girls.
   [RuPaul laughs, bell rings]
         [RuPaul laughs]
     - Welcome back, ladies.
    I've made some decisions.
    Peppermint, you're safe.
         Trinity Taylor,
   you gave us Glittafa Dayz,
         months, years.
           - [laughs]
      - Con-drag-ulations.
        You're the winner
    of this week's challenge.
        -Congratulations.
          -Oh, my God.
          - You've won
        two custom gowns
 from celebrity fashion designer
         David Meister.
          - Thank you.
     - And your drag sister
             has won
    a $2,000 gift certificate
   to Klein, Epstein & Parker,
     suits made to measure.
             - What?
         - You may step
    to the back of the stage.
      - Thank you so much.
         - Sasha Velour,
          you're safe.
      - Nina Bo'nina Brown,
        your bunny looks
 did not make the judges hoppy.
       I'm sorry, my dear,
 but you are up for elimination.
        Alexis Michelle,
  your Barbarellas were basic.
   Shea Coulee, your makeover
      of Bae was not okay.
        - Come on, Shea,
 come on, Shea, come on, Shaea.
       Alexis Michelle...
          You're safe.
     - Thank you very much.
            - Oh, no.
         - Shea Coulee,
       I'm sorry, my dear,
         but you are up
        for elimination.
       - To see the judges
          looking at me
     as if I let them down,
           I'm scared.
     - Ladies, this is your
    last chance to impress me
        and save yourself
        from elimination.
      The time has come...
            [thunder]
           to lip sync
    [echoing] for your life.
         - I almost want
     to just stand on stage
         and just point
    and do a Charlie number,
     but I'm also thinking,
         you know what?
          This is what
        I signed up for,
         so here we go.
          - Good luck,
      and don't fuck it up.
          [music plays]
               Ha!
             Shh...
           [applause]
             - Whoo!
            - Brava!
            - Ladies,
     I've made my decision.
          Shea Coulee,
       shantay, you stay.
      Join the other girls.
      - Thank you so much.
           Thank you.
      - Nina Bo'nina Brown
         Andre Charles,
       baby, you are part
        of my family now.
        Now sashay away.
          - Thank you.
             Sue me.
           [all laugh]
       - I think I might.
           [all laugh]
- I was trying to be a voice for
 the African American community
    who think all they can do
  is just do one type of drag,
    but I guess I just wasn't
     strong enough mentally.
 - You fucking changed my life.
   You're part of the family.
   Give me a hug and then get
      the fuck out of here.
  - Yeah, this thing is heavy.
        - No, no, no, no.
     I know, I know, I know.
      - Thank you so much,
         man, for real.
          -Yeah, yeah.
    -For being a true friend.
              Bye.
             - Bye.
             - Wait,
   give my damn leggings back.
      - Top five, bitches.
              - Ow!
           [cheering]
        - Now, remember,
   if you can't love yourself,
         how in the hell
  you gonna love somebody else?
        Can I get an amen
           up in here?
             -Amen!
             -Amen!
            - Right.
     Now let the music play.
           - [laughs]


        <i> - Previously on</i>
    <i> "RuPaul's Drag Race..."</i>
  - There's always been tension
       with me and Eureka.
     Maybe she has an issue
          with the fact
       that every pageant
       that we've been in,
           I beat her.
      - You need to create
       a totally original
       fairytale princess
       and sassy sidekick.
         Trinity Taylor.
      - This is really fun,
     and then you showed us
         your starfish.
          - Itch cream.
         [RuPaul laughs]
             - Aja.
   - I am Princess Disastah's
          smoke cloud.
    - I literally had no clue
   what was going on tonight.
        I also think that
    your makeup is very dark.
         - Kimora Blac.
    - My name is Funky Monkey
      from Banana Kingdom.
  - Trinity Taylor, you're the
winner of this week's challenge.
     Aja, shantay, you stay.
    Kimora Blac, sashay away.
         - Yes! Finally!
          - Oh, Kimore.
       - Oh, Kimora's gone
        and I am so sad.
  - How do you feel after that
  lip sync for your life, baby?
       - I just feel like
       I walked into here
          thinking like
       I was unstoppable,
       and now I feel like
  I really need to reevaluate.
    - For Aja, the challenge
         is going to be
       not becoming bitter
    because she sees herself
         as a superstar.
         And to be told
       your makeup is off,
your outfit isn't great is a bit
    of an ego check for her.
          - So Trinity,
     last week when you said
      that you were coming
      for Valentina's spot,
  how does it feel to be coming
      for Valentina's spot?
             -Uh-oh.
              -Ooh!
            - Shade.
         - Well, as long
      as we're being real,
     I don't think Valentina
    should've been top three.
          - Valentina,
    you know I live for you,
       but I think it was
   a little misjudged tonight.
   - These girls can continue
        to talk about me.
     They're not the judges.
        I'm ready to be,
         like, hmm, hmm.
       Whew. I'm focused.
        - Shea, I can't.
   - Bitch, I wore four items.
         I wore a panty,
       a chap and a coat.
           - Valentina
     came down the runway--
     I'm talking about you,
             bitch--
          In a leotard.
     I just don't understand
    the hype about Valentina.
     Listening to the judges
     critiques, I felt ugly.
 To hear someone constantly get
  praised for just being pretty
         when I'm trying
          to compensate
  with everything else I have,
            it sucks.
     People always undermine
            my drag.
    But you know what, girl?
    I think that I'm amazing.
       That there's people
     who think I'm amazing.
         I deserve to be
      in this competition.
       - Aja's true colors
         are coming out.
      She presents herself
as this person that's confident,
        but there's a lot
      of insecurity there.
       - I'm going to win
  next challenge, mark my word.
  Coming for you, Ms. Trinity!
       [car engine starts]
          - The winner
     of "RuPaul's Drag Race"
   receives a one-year supply
   of Anastasia Beverly Hills
            cosmetics
        and a cash prize
          of $100,000.
       With extra special
          guest judges
           "Unreal's"
     Jeffrey Bowyer-Chapman
        and Naya Rivera.
          - Hi, hi-hi.
        Aah! [all laugh]
            - I pass
     the third episode. Yes!
     You know, three is not
 my lucky number from Season 8.
             Ha-ha!
     - Hello, hello, hello!
           [cheering]
      Now, when most of you
     are just crawling home
   from being up in the club,
     "Good Morning America"
      and the "Today" show
    are ruling the airwaves.
      Now it's your chance
      to join the cutthroat
     morning talk show wars.
              -Ooh.
          -Oh, my God!
      - You'll be cohosting
    two rival morning shows.
          - Oh, my God.
       - #MorningBitches.
      [cheers and laughter]
      Now, Trinity, you won
      last week's challenge
      and Aja, you survived
          the lip sync,
           so you two
       are team captains.
              -Oh!
              -Yes!
        - Now, remember,
     in morning television,
    chemistry is everything.
   So pick your morning teams,
       starting with Aja.
          - Valentina.
  Even though I'm still giving
     Valentina the side eye,
       I am really curious
   what the judges see in her
        and maybe be able
   to channel that in myself.
            -Trinity.
          -Peppermint.
           [applause]
         - Slay Coulee.
           - Charlie.
         - Sasha Velour.
           - Ms. Cucu.
 - Whoopi Goldberg is not ready
      for her replacement.
           [all laugh]
       - Alexis Michelle.
            -Eureka!
              -Aah!
 - Outside of this competition,
    Eureka and I have a very
    up and down relationship,
       but I picked Eureka
         because I know
     she's gonna work hard,
      and I want to show Ru
         that I can work
          with anybody.
    - That leaves Farrah Moan
     and Nina Bo'nina Brown.
       - I'm going to say
          Farrah Moan.
        We needed a fish.
       - Which means Nina
       is on Team Trinity.
       - Come here, girl.
   - Team Aja, you're the host
   of "Good Morning Bitches."
    And Team Trinity, you're
   the host of "Not On Today."
             - Yeah!
         - Oh, and just
         one more thing.
    Your show is going to be
         broadcast live.
           Gentlemen,
       start your engines
   and may the best woman win.
       - #TeamNotOnToday.
   - Nina, do not let the fact
    that you were picked last
          in your head
        because I'm glad
    that you're on our team.
             - Okay.
      But at the same time,
        if you're, like,
    saying that we love you,
          when we have
        to choose groups,
   why would you run past me?
    I think the other queens
   see me as a Debbie Downer,
            the girl
      who gets in her head.
    But I can't just pretend
        when I'm over it.
   I kind of wear my emotions
          on my sleeve.
       - So Team Captain,
    is our television station
        set in the South?
         - There's three
      Southern Belles here.
   - But "Not On Today" I feel
     like is kind of ghetto.
    Do you think we should do
         ghetto accent?
            - No, no.
      - I think the biggest
      challenge for Trinity
     is going to be keeping
        everybody in line
        'cause she's got
     some big personalities.
          Let's just--
  She's got Eureka on the team.
            [laughs]
  And it may be kind of tough.
         - Ghetto fierce
       like, not on today.
     - This--okay, so first
    of all, as Team Captain,
      I don't want anybody
    to talk over each other.
       So raise your hand
       and let the person
         that's talking
   finish what they're saying.
            - Ha-ha.
      Here it comes, girl.
            Step one
     of competitive Trinity.
    - Also, I think we would
   have really good chemistry
        so we're gonna be
        the news anchors.
             - Okay.
     - Then, because you're
 really good at building stuff,
       you're really gonna
       be good at the DIY.
       And then, y'all are
    definitely entertainment.
      - We don't talk about
  who wants to play what role.
        Trinity is, like,
     you're doing this role,
     you're doing this role.
 So, to me, it wasn't a leader,
       it was a dictator.
       - When Ru was like
         "Not On Today,"
        it did give that,
      like, tinge of shade.
      - Okay, I'm so sorry.
         - God, please.
     This is typical Eureka.
  - You know, something shady.
     - Maybe we each could--
           - Maybe not
       towards each other.
          - This is me
       holding my hand up
     and following the rules
      that we set in place.
 If you're gonna set the rules,
        follow the rules.
   - Eureka needs to shut up.
        I'm trying to be
      a good Southern Belle
    and not punch this bitch
          in the face.
      - So all three of us
 just need to have our own vibe.
         You all need...
      - If y'all want to be
       that ghetto--yeah.
      - We're over-talking
      each other, remember?
           - [squawks]
         - What I think
        we should do now
            is break
      in our smaller groups
    and then we'll reconvene
  after we go over everything.
          - Yes, Miss.
     - Eureka wants it to be
        the Eureka Show,
    but that's not happening.
        Girl, no, ma'am.
         <i> - Coming up...</i>
     - Live in three, two...
           - First up,
     we have Raja and Raven.
         - Let's move on
      to the next one--oh.
       - And next, we have
       Coco Montrese and--
             - Next!
    [imitates bomb dropping]
   [RuPaul laughs, bell dings]
         [RuPaul laughs]
    - We're going to give you
            the scoop
      about Justin Bieber's
      shocking new sex tape
     with Dame Maggie Smith.
     The challenge this week
     is to cohost two rival
       morning chat shows.
   With my experience working
    with "Live," I'm excited.
     But also, I don't want
        to be just known
 as that guy that does Madonna,
       Cher and Lady Gaga.
   I'd like to be known for me
    because there's only one
   Charlie Hides in the world.
           Google it.
    - Trust me, you are going
         to watch this.
         - You're going
      to want to see this.
      - Okay. You're want--
          You're going
     to wanted to see this.
        - You're going--
        You are going...
    - Trust me. You are going
      to want to see this.
     - Cynthia has sometimes
      a haphazard approach.
        And with comedy,
    if you add an extra word,
     you can blow the joke.
           If you drop
       a couple of words,
     you can blow the joke.
    - Trust me, you are going
      to want to see this.
      - And just say want.
             - Want.
     - You're going to want
          to see this.
    - Okay. Trust me, you are
   going to want to see this.
         - You're going
      to want to see this.
    - Want to see this, okay.
             - Yeah.
             - Okay.
  - Yeah. But with a big smile.
    - Charlie's very strict.
    She's trying to correct,
  like, all the pronunciation,
     and I appreciate that.
      But that's what made
       my character funny,
   when I just pronounce words
     that are mispronounced.
    I'm Cynthia Lee Martinez
       Valles de la Flores
   filla de Orlando Fontaine.
    - But we call her Maria.
      - [chuckles] Charlie.
         - I wouldn't--
   I don't know if I'd laugh.
         - Aye dios mio.
    - Trust me, the laughing
    is going to be dead air.
     - Part of the challenge
     is to show personality,
    like how to be yourself.
  And Charlie, in certain way,
  is blocking me to be myself.
          - Just smile,
        just like, like,
    like I want to knife you.
     - Don't try to make me
     something that I'm not
     because that's gonna be
           a disaster.
             -Yeah?
              -Yes.
            - Hello.
      - It's time to shoot
    our rival morning shows.
     "Good Morning Bitches."
 - Welcome to your beautiful set
    furnished by 204 Events.
       Isn't is gorgeous?
           -Gorgeous!
              -Yes.
         - This is live.
     There are no take twos.
      Embrace the mistakes
 because some of the best magic
     comes out of the stuff
        that went wrong.
           All right.
  Take your place at the table.
       We're almost live.
        And we are ready
     in five, four, three...
    - Good morning, bitches.
    It's the top of the hour
 and time for today's headlines.
          - The world's
      hottest fashion trend
           is acrylic
       toenail extensions.
           - Oh, dear.
      - I actually just got
      mine done yesterday.
            - Oh, my!
      I may have to give it
    another thought, Farrah.
     - You won't regret it,
             Alexis.
      -I'll drink to that.
            -Cheers.
          - [chuckles]
      - All right. We're in
   commercials. Let's move on.
   Enter-taint-ment reporters,
        take your places.
- I don't really know where mine
 and Aja's relationship stands,
        but I have to do
       the best that I can
       to connect with her
         at this moment.
     - Live in three, two...
     -Good morning, bitches.
     -Good morning, bitches.
        - The latest meme
    taking over the internet
         is drag queens
   without eyebrows or teeth.
          -Oh, my God.
        -Can you imagine?
            First up,
     we have Raja and Raven.
             -Next.
             -Next.
         - Let's move on
      to the next one--oh.
    - And next, we have Coco
  Montrese and Alyssa Edwards.
      - You sure--I thought
   that was Laganja Estranja.
          - Oh, my God!
        - The resemblance
        is uncanny, girl.
             - True.
             - Next!
       - And we're clear.
        Commercial, guys.
   - [imitates bomb dropping]
       They have chemistry
           all right,
    but sometimes things can
   combust in a chemistry lab.
    You know what I'm saying?
          - Here we go.
    Coming out of commercial.
      DIY, you're next. Go!
       - Today, I'm going
       to be teaching you
    how to work in a RuPaul's
  chocolate bar into your diet.
    - I feel like people just
   don't eat enough chocolate.
      - You know, I agree.
    I love eating chocolate.
             -Sasha!
            -[laughs]
  - Do you have a solution for
 people who love to eat dessert,
        but hate waiting
    till the end of the meal?
         - Why not take
    a RuPaul's chocolate bar
     and put it in a salad?
     -Yeah, toss that salad.
          -Stir it up.
      You want to try some?
  - I thought you'd never ask.
       - Do you like that?
            - Mm-hmm.
               No.
             Sasha?
            -Uh-huh.
     - For queens that love
    the gym--for queens--mm.
            -[laughs]
   -Tastes great, doesn't it?
          -Oh, so good.
            -[laughs]
    - Sasha and I are really
     leaning on each other.
        We're having fun.
     The jokes are landing.
         It feels right.
          - So you take
   a RuPaul's chocolate bar...
       - Get out of town.
        - And you hide it
     in a stalk of broccoli.
    - You're just a magician.
           - [laughs]
       - It's a chocolate
           revolution.
     - And we're clear. Cut!
           [all laugh]
        Chew and swallow.
           All right.
     Reset for the celebrity
      interview. Let's go.
         - How are you?
             -Hello.
              -Hi!
    - When I see Naya Rivera,
         I'm like, yes!
          Come through.
      She was always one of
     my favorites on "Glee."
   - Are you ready to go live?
       In three, two, go!
        - Please welcome
       our special guest,
       actress and singer
          Naya Rivera.
       Good morning, Naya!
  - Hi, good morning, bitches.
           [all laugh]
    - Well, Naya, what advice
         would you have
          for a starlet
   who's trying to stick out.
     - When I first started
           on "Glee,"
         I didn't have,
        like, any lines,
       so I would just sit
  in the back of that classroom
     and, like, roll my neck
     and do anything I could
    to get that camera on me.
         And it worked.
        - Congratulations
        on your new book.
        "Sorry Not Sorry"
      is an amazing title.
    Where did that come from?
    - The book is all about,
            you know,
   learning from your mistakes
         and being sorry
        about some things
          and not sorry
    about some other things.
           -Same here.
             -Right?
     - So, Naya, what advice
           do you have
   to young aspiring actresses
    who want to make a career
          in show biz.
  - Find something else to do.
           [all laugh]
          - Well, Naya,
   we cannot thank you enough
    for being with us today.
    -Thank you for having me.
      -It was so much fun.
   - We'll be sure to see you
     tomorrow morning for...
    -"Good Morning Bitches."
    -"Good Morning Bitches."
        -And we're clear.
    -Best show on television.
           [all laugh]
         -<i> Coming up...</i>
         - I don't want
        any extra breast
       other than--unless
    they come with, uh, two--
    two biscuits--two breasts
        and two biscuits.
         - I'm confused.
     Peppermint's confused.
   We're all fucking confused.
   [RuPaul laughs, bell dings]
         [RuPaul laughs]
     - It's time for my team
   "Not On Today" to go live.
          - Get ready!
   Five, four, three, two, go!
         - Good morning.
    It's time for the biggest
       stories of the day.
          - The Center
     for Infectious Diseases
 has announced there's something
       in your makeup bag
    that could be killing you
           right now.
  - I wonder what it could be?
 - I don't know, but whatever's
       in your makeup bag,
    you should throw it away.
 - That's okay, because I'm sure
whatever I have in my makeup bag
    would certainly kill you.
     Uh, like your husband's
         business card.
         - [fake laugh]
         - And in health
        and science news,
  all of Michelle Visage's fans
       have come together
            to create
     a crowdfunding campaign
         to pay for her
    breast reduction surgery.
     You know, I don't want
        any extra breast
       other than--unless
    they come with, uh, two--
    two biscuits--two breasts
        and two biscuits.
             Jesus.
            - Now for
   the enter-taint-ment report
       with Charlie Hides
    and Cynthia Lee Fontaine.
         - Good morning.
      Today, we're talking
          social media.
  There's a fun new game people
   are playing on the internet
     called #SophiesChoices.
    I give you two scenarios.
      You tell me which one
    of the two you'd choose.
   You have to lick ice cream
       off Nick Jonas' abs
        or eat fudge off
    Chris Hemsworth's chest.
  - Let me tell you something.
     I'm intolerant lactose.
       I don't mind to go
   all the way to the hospital
        just only to eat
       that banana split.
           - [laughs]
          - Do you have
       a question for me?
   -I got a question for you.
             -Good.
    - You get one night with
   Justin Bieber totally naked
        or one night with
     Justin Bieber's money.
      - So I would probably
       have sex with him,
      have a hidden camera,
    send the pictures to TMZ
    and then keep the money.
   - I'm gonna keep the money
             because
     I don't know if Justin
       had the opportunity
      to deal with my cucu.
        It's time for...
    -Who Done Wore It Better.
    -Who Done Wore It Better.
     - Detox, the drag queen
     or Detox, the pussycat?
   - The cat looks incredible.
           - [laughs]
        - I'm looking at
    Detox the pussycat's hair
    and it looks a little bit
       like Winifred from
      "Hocus Post--Pocus"?
   - Charlie, what's going on?
   He is cold as a dead body.
   He's so tense, so nervous.
            - I think
     we're gonna earn favor
         of our--one of
    our favorite drag queens,
  Bob--uh, sorry, Thorgy Thor.
           Shantay...
           -You stay!
           -You stay!
         - And finally--
    well, that's about all--
    that's about all the time
     we have for right now.
     - Don't touch the dial!
        - Don't touch me.
       - And we're clear.
        Commercial, guys.
           We're live
       in three, two, go.
         - Welcome back.
    It's eight past the hour.
 - Eureka and Nina Bo-nina Brown
            are here
        to give us some--
        give us some tips
  on how to do drag on a dime.
       - All right, Nina.
   Now, this lace right here,
     it is 100% human hair,
      but it costs $7,300.
      - Girl, what you need
        to do is, honey,
   get your platinum EBT card,
              girl.
             - Okay.
        - And go on down
   to the Dollar Store, girl,
      and get you a lavish
     ramen noodle wig, girl.
    - Oh. Is it beef flavor?
     - Ooh, chicken, bitch.
      Goes for a mere price
            of $6.00.
       - Oh, it looks good
     and tastes good, girl.
              -Hey.
             -Okay.
       Now, let's move on.
         We've got these
     ass cheek pads, honey.
      Gel. Per cheek, $200.
        - Girl, a cheek.
         You're doing it
        all wrong, mama.
       Get this ham, girl.
       For the mere price
        of $8.00, honey.
         - $8.00, bitch.
       - And stuff her up.
             Oh, oh!
       - Well, all right.
     Oh, she's edible, too.
    She look good and she...
       -Tastes good, girl.
       -Tastes good, girl.
       - Great, and we're
         in commercial.
         We're moving on
   to the celebrity interview.
          - Me and Nina
       fucking killed it.
         The ham's good.
    Can I have another piece?
       - We're coming back
        in three, two...
        - Please welcome
     our very special guest,
       actress and singer
          Naya Rivera.
    Are you happy to be here?
      - Hi. "Not On Today."
           [all laugh]
    - Now, I heard somewhere
     that when you were 19,
     you lied on your resume
          to get a job
     at Abercrombie & Fitch?
           -I did. I--
 -Did you fudge the truth at all
       to get onto "Glee"?
    - No. I had to actually--
      I had to sing and act
          for that one.
 - What's the name of your book
   and when is it coming out?
          - It's called
        "Sorry Not Sorry:
        Dreams, Mistakes
         and Growing Up"
        and it comes out
         September 13th.
         - I'm thinking
   that Trinity and Peppermint
      are not noticing that
    it's time to wrap it up.
     - My publishers and I,
 we just kind of really loved it
   and thought it was clever.
       - It's not my job.
       I'm not the anchor,
but I'm just thinking Joy Behar,
       what would she do?
   - I can't wait to read it.
       - Thanks very much
         for joining us.
            It's time
      to go to commercial.
       - Do I get up now?
         - I'm confused.
     Peppermint's confused.
   We're all fucking confused.
         - Am I leaving?
             - Okay.
       All right, ladies,
       we're off the air,
    but nobody said goodbye.
    - This is definitely bad.
         Bad, bad, bad.
    That's all I'm thinking,
              bad.
         -<i> Coming up...</i>
  - You're making a really bad
    first impression with me.
          - Why are you
     talking over me, girl?
        - I can hear you
        talking about me.
      - Because I'm upset.
   [RuPaul laughs, bell dings]
         [RuPaul laughs]
     -Good morning bitches.
     -Good morning bitches.
     - It's elimination day
      and our runway today
      is naughty nighties.
   - How are you doing, girl?
           - I'm okay.
  I just don't want to go home.
             -Right.
        -Me and Valentina
      didn't have chemistry
        in the challenge,
      and it makes me feel
         really nervous
     because I just came off
           the bottom.
  I think it's going to affect
     how the judges see me.
      You know me, Alexis.
             - Yeah.
           - You know
      what I'm capable of.
     Like, it's not my 100%.
     - It's really hard when
  you're in a pressure cooker.
       - But I don't feel
    like I'm under pressure.
          I feel maybe
       I'm overconfident.
    - Aja, I'm not gonna lie.
          You're, like,
      oftentimes negative.
   You're making a really bad
    first impression with me
     because I can hear you
in the corners talking about me.
   Maybe some advice is that,
    like, don't focus on me.
   Don't focus on other girls.
        Focus in on you.
       - I just feel like
 I've been such a disappointment
      while I've been here,
        and I took it out
     in all the wrong ways.
         - All we can do
         moving forward
         is to be kinder
    to each other, you know?
        - Yeah, I agree.
       I really genuinely
         like Valentina.
   I'm just really frustrated
        because I really
        want this so bad,
         and I feel like
         I'm fucked up.
  You're a really good person.
        I'm really sorry.
           - I accept
       your apology, babe.
       Just let me finish
         doing my makeup
   'cause it's more important.
              -Aah!
            -[laughs]
    - Tell me about the work
         you were doing
      from HIV prevention.
  - I do referrals for clients
         who--they were
    newly diagnosed with HIV.
     - And it's so important
        that people know.
   I'm of the era when people
  would be spreading the virus
       before we even knew
         it had a name.
     I came out just before
       AIDS became known.
      So none of my friends
       were playing safe.
  I buried all my best friends,
    most of my best friends,
      and...that's probably
       the hardest thing.
            Sometimes
    I have survivor's guilt.
     Like why did I survive?
    It was a death sentence.
    I've seen so many smart,
   beautiful, talented people
   go the route of the pills,
       drugs, the bottle.
    Society was telling them
    they are not good enough.
         The one message
       I try to get across
   is you're worth it, you're
   special, you're beautiful.
        And you're worth
    taking care of yourself.
            [sobbing]
    So you gotta stay strong,
       and you gotta rely
        on your friends.
     - Thank you for sharing
           that story.
   Because of your generation,
   we appreciate what we have.
        - It's important
          to not forget
          what happened
  in the eighties and nineties
     during the AIDS crisis
          and how many
        brilliant voices
  in the world of art and drag
          we could have
      without those losses.
   - My makeup is going to be
  fucking ruined on the runway.
     - Do a smoky eye, girl.
           - [laughs]
     - Does anyone here have
      psoriasis or just me?
       - I have bad acne.
   - I have really bad breath
         in the morning.
             - Eew.
   - Can I tell you guys about
one of the disorders that I have
    that I'm struggling with?
            - Eating.
    - Don't joke about that.
             Eureka,
    it's really inappropriate
       to joke about that.
    - Sasha, okay, I realize,
         but why push it
     straight to negativity?
- I don't think she's pushing it
     straight to negativity.
  I think that she's trying to
   keep the levels respectful.
     - By trying to make me
     look like a bad person?
        - I have nothing
          against you,
    but I have a long history
     with eating disorders.
       You don't know now
       by looking at me--
   - There are other types of
   eating disorders besides--
       - But so many times
          in my life--
       Why are you talking
         over me, girl?
      - Because I'm upset.
     I make the joke to try
     to make the air light.
         I'm not trying
         to be malicious
     and I'm all of a sudden
       not a good person.
 - Can I tell you how many times
    people have looked at me
   and been like, oh, my God,
        you're anorexic.
      It's really hurtful.
         - I never come
        at any of you all
       with a nasty tone,
           so when I--
     - I really didn't think
       I was being nasty.
    - Let me finish, please.
    But you had a nasty tone,
    and that's what upset me
            about it.
  - Look, I'm coming over here
     because if it came off
          as an attack,
      I do truly apologize.
    I would never want that.
       I am just trying--
  - Well, I apologize that you
  were offended by what I said.
           - I wasn't.
  - You obviously were offended
     at what I said, right?
        What do you want
         from me, girl?
         Do you want me
     to get down on my knees
   and beg you to forgive me?
         - Girl, please.
    - I think I want you guys
    to focus on getting ready
         for the runway.
             'Cause
     it's going in circles.
             [sighs]
         [RuPaul laughs]
            And what?
   - Welcome to the main stage
    of "RuPaul's Drag Race."
    Good morn-ting, Michelle.
      Girl, did you wake up
           like that?
           - Actually,
     can I have five minutes
           so I can go
       put some makeup on?
          - You should.
           [all laugh]
        And the hilarious
          Ross Mathews.
     Now, would you wake up
         with my girls?
       - Morning, would I?
       - From the TV show,
            "Unreal,"
      "Drag Race" superfan
     Jeffrey Bowyer-Chapman.
         Are you hungry?
     - Positively ravenous.
           [all laugh]
       - And the beautiful
    and talented Naya Rivera.
    - This is truly the most
     magical of experiences.
   - Well, make sure you still
      have your pocketbook.
              - Oh.
          - This week,
    we challenged our queens
   to rise and shine on their
   very own morning talk show.
   And tonight, they're gonna
    sleepwalk down the runway
   in their naughty nighties.
           Gentlemen,
       start your engines,
   and may the best woman win.
   Category is...Farrah Moan.
        Alexis Michelle.
              Aja.
           Valentina.
          Shea Coulee.
          Sasha Velour.
         Trinity Taylor.
           Peppermint.
         Charlie Hides.
      Cynthia Lee Fontaine.
             Eureka.
       Nina Bo'nina Brown
         Joyner-Kersee.
   Now, she's reminding me to
   always use my night cream.
        [Michelle laughs]
          <i> Coming up...</i>
     Who deserves to go home
        tonight and why?
            - [sobs]
   [RuPaul laughs, bell dings]
         [RuPaul laughs]
        Welcome, ladies.
        The judges and I
   watched your morning shows
          and I've made
         some decisions.
     When I call your name,
      please step forward.
          Shea Coulee.
          Sasha Velour.
            Ladies...
       Con-drag-ulations.
    You are both the winners
    of this week's challenge.
        - It feels great
        to win with Sasha
  because I really feel myself
           developing
     a friendship with her.
    - You've each won $1,000
 and a year's supply of burgers
     from Hamburger Mary's,
    where you can eat, drink
       and be merry, Mary.
           [all laugh]
  Team "Good Morning Bitches,"
        you're all safe.
           [applause]
    You may leave the stage.
           That means
      Team "Not On Today,"
          you're all up
        for elimination.
            It's time
   for the judges' critiques,
            starting
      with Trinity Taylor.
  - I think you look stunning.
     I'm incredibly jealous
          of your ass.
     - But your performance
        in the challenge,
     it seemed very uptight,
            very mean
        and I don't think
     anybody wants to watch
     anybody bitchy and mean
         in the morning.
         - The storyline
       that we went with,
   she slept with my husband,
    and so there was all this
      underlining despise.
      - On a morning show,
    it has to be a little bit
       more light-hearted.
If I were flipping the channels,
     I would keep flipping.
          - Peppermint.
          - Your makeup
       does look gorgeous.
         I do, however,
        hate the outfit.
   I think that you could have
 put a lot more effort into it.
            - I think
      it's a little short,
    so when you turn around,
    like, we're seeing stuff.
      - Though you fumbled
     the ball a few times...
  - A breast and two biscuits.
   - I thought your character
         was fun-loving.
          I don't know
        whose job it was
          to, I guess,
    excuse me from the table
     so that, as the guest,
   I knew that I could leave.
    I don't know who dropped
      the ball on that one.
   - Can I take responsibility
            for that?
     I was a little confused
           at the end.
             - Okay.
   - I'll take responsibility
          for it, too.
           I'm sorry,
    I don't want you to think
      that you were, like,
        an afterthought.
    - No, no, no, not at all.
        But you could get
        some real bitches
       that would take it
         personal, so...
      - Dame Charlie Hides.
   - I love the look tonight.
          I was worried
    you were gonna fall over.
   Those are some high heels.
      -They are very high.
           -Very high.
      - But what I noticed
     about your performance
         is that you are
        a control freak.
       You were so married
         to those cards.
   Cynthia didn't even finish
            her line
     and you already, like,
        look, look, look.
        And when you were
       interviewing Naya,
      when you ask somebody
           a question,
            you need
     to let them answer it.
     - It felt like you were
      stepping on her lines
     and the timing was off.
      Cynthia Lee Fontaine.
   - To me, this does not read
           as nightie,
   but what I loved about you
        in the challenge
   was that even when Charlie
    was trying to direct you
     in her controlling way,
         you were funny
  and you messed the words up.
            You were
    intolerant lactose and...
            -[laughs]
        -You are a star.
   I really think that you've,
    like, come into your own.
        Really well done.
          - Thank you.
            - Eureka.
   - Again, this doesn't read
         nightie to me.
     This reads dominatrix.
   It's so funny how this end
        is really nightie
  and that end is just whores.
           - [laughs]
   - Well, surprise, surprise,
    I disagree with Michelle.
  You're clearly going to bed.
        You're just doing
        different things
   on that side of the runway.
            - You two
   were my favorite to watch.
   Chemistry is not something
          you can buy.
       That's why this one
      has me around still.
           - [laughs]
  - Up next, Nina Bo'nina Brown
         Rodham Clinton.
           [all laugh]
          - [sniffling]
   I'm gonna probably be like
   the cry baby of the season.
        -It's okay, mama.
           -I'm sorry.
      I'm just so grateful
           to be here.
        [sobs] I'm happy.
          - Well, Nina,
   if those are tears of joy,
       I'd hate to see you
       when you're upset.
           [all laugh]
       We love you, girl.
   Let's go to the critiques.
   - Again, it doesn't scream
         nightie to me.
           It screams
      streetwalking whore.
         And I love it!
       - In the talk show,
       you were serving me
   the Lady Chablis realness.
    The painted on spit curl
          was just like
       the cherry on top.
     - But you're gonna need
         a thicker skin
         to get through
        this competition.
         I so appreciate
     what this means to you.
   I just want you to be ready
          for how tough
       this is gonna get.
    - You all worked so hard
       on this challenge,
        but I have to ask
          one question.
     Who deserves to go home
        tonight and why?
         Trinity Taylor.
   - Just from your critique,
      it would be Charlie.
          - Peppermint,
         same question.
    - Based on the critiques,
            Charlie.
        - Charlie Hides.
  - Peppermint's look is a bit
   more basic, so Peppermint.
     - Cynthia Lee Fontaine.
    - Because I believe she's
   a strong competition for me
       and her total look,
           Peppermint.
      - All right, Eureka,
           you're up.
     - I would say Trinity.
           I feel like
       the ending wrap-up
         might have been
    a little more controlled
    if we worked as a group.
      And I also felt like
   she was focused on herself
     and not really so much
        of everyone else.
         - I call shade.
    I take responsibility for
   the things that I did wrong
    and if that's the reason
      why I should go home,
       then I understand.
     But don't tell me that
 I didn't do my job as a leader,
         because I did.
    And I included everybody,
     including you, Eureka.
       - Well, I was asked
       my honest opinion,
  and that's my honest opinion
     and I stand beside it.
       - All right. Nina.
       - Trinity, because
      she was the captain.
      But she did her job.
 It's just that we didn't really
  feel a part of it sometimes.
      - Thank you, ladies.
   Thank you for your honesty.
   While you untuck backstage,
        the judges and I
        will deliberate.
       [car engine starts]
           All right.
 Well, just between us squirrel
   friends, what do you think?
         Let's start off
      with Trinity Taylor.
  - Her morning talk show host,
      I just didn't get it.
        - I think Trinity
        really tripped up
          with that gag
         they were doing
   because it didn't allow her
    to be her charming self.
           Peppermint.
       - My first thought
            was that
   it seemed like a rehearsal.
   - For me, it was more about
       her outfit tonight.
     - The black lace shirt
  with a pink wrinkled nightie,
    it just was a whole bunch
           of a mess.
    But I liked her better of
 the two in the anchor position.
        - Charlie Hides.
           - The walk
     on the runway tonight,
   she seemed tired or bored.
    She just wasn't shining.
   - She was my least favorite
        in the challenge.
   - My notes next to her name
    say dead behind the eyes.
            Gave up.
           - [laughs]
     - I'm just disappointed
  that a seasoned vet like that
       doesn't understand
          how TV works.
        She didn't allow
      the moment to happen.
   In fact, it almost impeded
  on Cynthia Lee's performance.
      Cynthia Lee Fontaine.
  - She was so fierce tonight.
   She was giving, like, X-Men
   weird angel/devil realness.
       - In her challenge,
      she was so much fun.
           I couldn't
       stop watching her.
  Dare I say that we are crazy
         for cucu puffs?
           [all laugh]
            -Eureka.
    -I liked her immediately.
  She was funny, she was real,
       she was believable.
       - If I see a poster
       for Eureka's show,
       I'm buying a ticket
       and I'm showing up.
          - When I find
       where her show is,
   do you want to go with me?
          - Girl, yes.
      - Nina Bo'nina Brown
         Bowyer-Chapman.
           - [laughs]
    Walking down the runway,
       she was incredible
      and in the challenge,
        she was on fire.
     - But the vulnerability
           is so raw,
     I just worry about her.
         - This industry
    can be quite challenging,
  and you can't show up to work
        crying every day.
      - All right. Silence.
     I've made my decision.
        [Michelle laughs]
           I got that
      from the "Glee" show.
          - You got it
      from the "Glee" show.
   [RuPaul laughs, bell dings]
         [RuPaul laughs]
     - Welcome back, ladies.
    I've made some decisions.
     Cynthia Lee Fontaine...
          you're safe.
          - Thank you.
        - Trinity Taylor,
      as a morning anchor,
   you nearly sank your team.
       I'm sorry, my dear,
 but you are up for elimination.
             - Okay.
            - Eureka,
       Nina Bo'nina Brown,
        you're both safe.
          - Thank you.
         - You may join
        the other girls.
           Peppermint.
      You're a good sport,
         but this week,
      you fumbled the ball.
         Charlie Hides,
    you are one fierce queen,
     but this week, you put
 the ain't in enter-taint-ment.
       I'm sorry, Charlie,
         but you are up
        for elimination.
           Peppermint,
      join the other girls.
          - Thank you.
          - Two queens
        stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last chance
          to impress me
        and save yourself
        from elimination.
      The time has come...
            [thunder]
           to lip sync
    [echoing] for your life!
       - This is my chance
     to show the other girls
  that if you go up against me
         in a lip sync,
      you better bring it,
        because I'm going
   to send these bitches home.
         I want to win.
          I don't care
        if we're friends.
           - Good luck
      and don't fuck it up.
          [music plays]
         -What the hell?
            - Trinity
      is selling the song.
   Charlie, on the other hand,
   it looks like she's telling
  children to get off her lawn.
       - Come on, Charlie.
     Do something, Charlie.
            - I'm not
      a lip sync performer.
         99% of the acts
      in London sing live.
  So I just need Ru to say it.
          Sashay away.
      [cheers and applause]
       - Oh, my goodness.
      - Ladies, I have made
          my decision.
         Trinity Taylor,
  you went all the way tonight.
       Shantay, you stay.
          - Thank you.
           [applause]
         - You may join
        the other girls.
          - Thank you.
      - Dame Charlie Hides.
         London, Boston,
       and now the world.
          Sashay away.
        - Thank you, Ru.
  It's been a pleasure, girls.
      I am a control freak.
       I make no apologies
            for that.
      And I don't lip sync.
          I sing live.
         I always said,
   if I get in the bottom two,
         I might as well
  just turn around and walk out
    because I don't lip sync.
          Older queens,
  I'm laying down the gauntlet.
             Send in
      your application tape
    and do better than I did,
             please.
      - Con-drag-ulations,
           my queens.
        Oh, and remember,
   if you can't love yourself,
         how in the hell
  you gonna love somebody else?
        Can I get an amen
         up in "herre"?
             -Amen!
             -Amen!
      - Let the music play.


          <i> - Previously</i>
   <i> on</i> "RuPaul's Drag<i> Race..."</i>
       You'll be roasting
        Michelle Visage.
           [cheering]
       - Michelle Visage
         is so Jersey,
  her idea of classical music
         is Lisa Lisa.
          [all laugh]
     - Happy 90th birthday,
           Michelle.
          [all laugh]
    - Michelle Visage judges
     a talent competition.
    I don't know about you,
     but don't you actually
have to have talent to do that?
             Ha...
         - Farrah Moan.
    - Nothing landed, honey.
       - Alexis Michelle.
   - It's a Hanukkah miracle.
         Baruch HaShem.
      - I literally forget
  there was an audience here.
  That's how silent they were.
         - My question
     the whole entire time
      is why is she green?
    - Well, Tamar, have you
     ever watched the show?
- Peppermint, you're the winner
   of this week's challenge.
           [applause]
        Alexis Michelle,
       shantay you stay.
   Farrah Moan, sashay away.
       -Oh, my goodness.
             -Girl.
           - [sighs]
          -Oh, Farrah.
          -Oh, Farrah.
             - Why?
            -Farrah.
            -Oh, no.
            - Farrah
      was just eliminated.
       I'm going to miss
          the whining.
      It was so charming.
             - Ooh.
       - Congratulations,
          Miss Alexis.
     - How are you feeling?
  - I'm usually so comfortable
           on my feet
    in front of an audience.
    And to choke like that,
        I scarcely know
         what happened.
  - Alexis is feeling a little
 shook up after this challenge.
       Her ego definitely
   got checked a little bit.
        And we're still
       asking ourselves,
   why is she fucking green?
      - Look at you trying
    to strip for the camera.
    - You're my best friend.
        You're my best--
             - Oh!
          [all laugh]
        - Bitch, shame.
   - Once again, I look over
  and Nina is off to the side
       not participating.
     She's somewhere else.
       You've been quiet.
  - Honestly, I did feel like
          some people
 were coming for me, you know.
 - Did someone say that to you
    or is this stuff that--
    - No, I can hear stuff.
  I could've swore I've heard
certain girls kind of talking--
  not saying my name, per se,
   but I feel like they were
   kind of talking about me.
         I'm not trying
         to make it up.
  - So you're saying you know
    that people are talking
    about you to each other.
     - A little bit, yeah.
             Yeah.
 - Nina thinks that everyone's
        out to get her.
  I think she thinks it's some
   kind of a drag conspiracy,
    and it's just not true.
  - I'm just taking things in.
     - It seems like you're
     starting to withdraw.
        I don't want you
      to go back to that.
      - Nina needs to call
         Patti LaBelle,
        'cause she needs
        a new attitude.
     - We started with 14,
    and there are seven now.
          - Ooh, shit,
       it's getting real.
        - At this point
      in the competition,
the filler bitches are starting
  to fall off left and right.
  You gotta go, you gotta go,
       and you gotta go.
             Next.
      [car engine starts,
          bell rings]
          - The winner
    of "RuPaul's Drag Race"
   receives a one-year supply
   of Anastasia Beverly Hills
           cosmetics
        and a cash prize
          of $100,000.
       With extra special
          guest judges
"The Real O'Neal's" Noah Galvin
      and Lisa Robertson.
     - Swish, swish, turn.
        - At this point
      in the competition,
       it is getting down
      to the nitty-gritty.
       We're all fighting
   for the same title to win.
   Move out the way, bitches,
    'cause I'm going to win.
            A-currr.
       - I'm gonna, like,
  rub your head for good luck.
           - I'm sure
       it does something.
   - Trinity's always trying
    to rub somebody's head.
      - You now have lice.
             - Aah!
      - I'm from Alabama.
       I'm used to that.
             - Aah!
           - [laughs]
        You told a joke.
          [all laugh]
          [door opens]
     - Hello, hello, hello!
             - Hey!
             - Hey!
   - Ladies, by inviting you
        to "Drag Race,"
       I've provided you
        with a platform
 that reaches millions of fans
       around the world.
     And now it's your turn
      to take your careers
       to the next level.
       So for this week's
        maxi challenge,
        you will create,
         write and star
     in your own TV pilot.
             - Oh!
             - Yes!
      - #YourPilotsOnFire.
          [all laugh]
    You need to come up with
concepts, characters and stories
    that lay the groundwork
    for a new hit TV series.
        You need to work
      in two teams of two
     and one team of three.
   That's called mathematics.
          [all laugh]
  I'll let you pick your teams
           right now.
            - Brrr.
  - Of course, Sasha and Shea
     cling to one another.
      Surprise, surprise.
      - Oh, my God. Okay.
       I was going to go
   and make a bee line toward
  the other side of the room,
       but turned around
and there was two lovely ladies
      walking towards me,
     so I couldn't really,
           like, run.
        - Y'all love me
  and you think I'm creative,
      but you ran past me
 to the next person. All right.
            - Yeah?
          Okay, yeah.
    - They were like, okay,
    I guess we're teammates.
    - Now, whatever you do,
      make your charisma,
  uniqueness, nerve and talent
         binge-worthy.
          So good luck
     and don't fuck it up.
           [applause]
    - So cops is an option.
      What are some other,
       like, situations?
            - Spies.
       - Is now the time
    for the Russian accent?
          [both laugh]
        - That's right.
     - I finally get to do
      a Russian character.
        I'm so excited.
     [Russian accent] Like,
    I hacked into the villa.
          [both laugh]
    I hacked into Versace's
       spring collection.
 - Does anybody have any ideas
       right off the bat?
         - I have one.
  So my idea is, I think there
  should be two church ladies.
       Each of your sons
     just came out as gay.
        And then a nun.
         I think a nun
     would be really funny.
         - I like that.
       - We're aiming for
   something very religious,
     but with a gay twist.
         - This summer,
     two mothers, two sons,
        one holy secret.
        - That's great.
  Look, girls, you know what?
   This is going to be easier
  to spread out on the table.
             -Okay.
     -Let's do it up here.
     - I really would like
     to do the voiceovers.
             -Okay.
   -Um, I know that normally
        there's only one
        voiceover voice.
   I would love if there was
     a way to split it up,
just because I feel like I have
a lot to prove after last week.
 - I think it needs to be clear
        who's speaking.
     It would be confusing
            to them.
        - I would rather
   one of you two just do it.
 So flip a coin or one of y'all
   just, you know, step back
  and let the other one do it.
     - I know for sure that
    I really want to do it,
    but I don't want to have
    a fight with Peppermint.
 - Can we just read through it
        a couple times?
            - Yeah,
    we need a read-through.
        - So now Alexis
   wants to do the voiceover.
       Mm-mm. She's gonna
     have to pry this part
      from my cold, dead,
        manicured hands.
         <i> - Coming up...</i>
  - Where are the Espadrilles?
          -[chuckles]
           -Children!
       - Beat me, bitch.
          [both laugh]
           - [coughs]
  [RuPaul laughs, bell rings]
- "If you could create your own
hit TV show, what would it be?"
        For this week's
        maxi challenge,
          we're making
       our own TV shows.
       I'm not not happy
that I have to write something.
     It's just I feel like
        I have to prove
      that I have a talent
     that I might not know
       that I might have,
        but I hope I do.
   - Okay, so what can we do?
             Okay.
    - Maybe we work together
         in an office.
    - Okay. It could be like
some kind of like "Maury" show,
     like who's baby is it
         or something.
         I don't know.
      - Nina and Valentina
    have ended up together,
           and I say
      recipe for disaster.
  - We have to know our lines.
     - That's gonna be easy
       because we can go
      based off of improv
    in the moment, you know.
        - We can adlib,
       yeah, yeah, yeah.
       - I think we have
       a great chemistry,
     and I know the judges
      personally love us.
   So I think that's gonna be
        to our benefit.
   - So you come and join me
  over here on the dark side.
 Is it just to work next to me
  'cause you love me so much?
   - That's about half of it.
          I'm just not
        feeling too good
  about, like, my relationship
      with Nina right now.
   - You two were very tense
           last week.
      - Yeah. My feelings
     were just really hurt.
    - Some girls here think,
    oh, she's not original.
   Oh, she's not being funny,
            she's--
   -Who is saying that, Nina?
             -You.
         - What, bitch?
     No, I never said that.
         -Yes, you did.
     -When did I say that?
        - You've said it
        more than once.
   - I wasn't even trying to
   throw any of that your way
      'cause I don't play
     those games with you.
         I have always
      looked out for you.
  I have always built you up.
      I have defended you.
         So it actually
   really hurts my feelings,
             'cause
      that's not who I am,
   and I've never done that.
   This morning, I felt like
  she was even more cold to me
      and, like, distant.
     And I was just, like,
      I think I just need
     to just kind of, like,
  distance myself a little bit
   so I can concentrate more
      on the competition.
The energy that she's giving me
     is just really whack,
     and I've just kind of
       reached my limit.
           I'm done.
         - Why, hello.
              -Hi.
         -Well, hello.
           - Welcome,
       ladies and sister.
    - It's time for my team
     to shoot our TV pilot.
  I actually feel pretty good
       about our chances.
          We're pros,
         we look great,
     and Alexis looks like
Kathleen mother fucking Turner.
   - You've got the pit crew
            to use,
 and you can use whatever props
     and furniture you need
        from 204 Events.
         - Let's start
       with the voiceover
      so we can get those
        out of the way.
    Does that work for you?
       - Great. Perfect.
         Trinity Taylor
     as Sister Mary Koont,
     "Mary, Mother Of Gay."
        - Cut. How about
   on "Mary, Mother Of Gay?"
        - Trinity Taylor
      as Sister Mary Koont
   on "Mary, Mother Of Gay."
    -That was pretty great.
          -Thank you.
    - Did you all get the T
           on Koont?
   - We did the time before.
          -Okay, cool.
             -Yeah.
         - You probably
        want to move on.
        - Next scene is
 we are in the sister's office
         in the church.
     - Do it in the rectory
          real quick?
           - [laughs]
           The what?
      - If I had a nickel.
          And action.
 - Your son is always listening
    to Broadway show tunes.
        - Well, your son
    is always baking cakes.
    - Alexis, your accent's
 just a little bit too twangy.
    Where we're "bay a cay."
      You don't have to go
         too hillbilly.
     - Yeah. A little more
       Julia Sugarbaker?
          - Alexis has
    a real opportunity here
         to go extreme
   with this crazy character,
       and she's playing
    this conservative lady.
     Really conservatively.
    - Your son bakes cakes.
    - Well, your son always
  has something in his mouth.
      - Children, it's not
     the end of the world.
  - Trinity, just bring it up.
  These are two loud bitches,
  so you gotta overpower them.
             -Okay.
       -That is not my--
         -Mercy, Lord.
           -Children!
           - [laughs]
   - Father Ross, his breath
 always smells like dick, too.
           - [laughs]
            [coughs]
   - Can we say "dick" on TV?
     - Of course, you can.
   "The Dick Van Dyke Show."
  - He said "dick" and "dyke."
            - Well.
- That's good family television
          right there.
      - It is. Thank you.
        Welcome, ladies.
             -Hey.
   -Tell us what's going on.
        - We're gonna do
      a funky spy dramedy.
   - [Russian accent] And I'm
  an ex-Commie Russian mommy.
   - I'm gonna be a Kung Fu,
        fighting crime.
      - Are we doing like
 a blaxploitation feeling here
     where things are like,
           pow, boom?
       -Yes. Absolutely.
             -Yeah.
      - Okay, let's start
  with your voiceover. Action.
      - This unlikely duo
   will have to work together
  to defeat the greatest evil
          of all time.
         - Bad fashion.
      - Okay. I would love
     for you to go for it.
        Be those voices.
          - It's like
    the Moviefone recording.
             -Yeah.
     -Welcome to Moviefone.
         - Yeah, yeah.
     - If you know the name
of the movie you'd like to see,
         press one now.
           -Perfect.
          -And action.
       - "Teets & Asky."
    - See you next Tuesday.
         - At midnight,
         mother fucker.
           -[laughs]
        -That was great.
  - Where are the Espadrilles?
        I said where are
        the Espadrilles?
   Bitch, I'm talking to you!
       I said, where are
        the Espadrilles?
     - [laughs and coughs]
          - Look good?
          [all laugh]
      -That's perfection.
    -That works. That works.
   - Good, good, good, good,
           let's go.
     Tick-tock, tick-tock.
        You don't stop.
    - Um, next up is Sunset?
             -Yes.
            -Action.
     Friends forever, BFFs.
   Looks like Ernie and Bert.
              Oh.
             - Oh.
       -This feels wrong.
        -Really awkward.
         That's a wrap
       on "Teets & Asky."
   Thanks for being prepared.
             -Whoo!
             -Aah!
  - Valentina and Nina Bo'Nina
      Brown Jessy Raphael.
       - What's the name
          of the show?
        -"Nina & Tina."
             -Okay.
  Do we have voiceovers to do?
        - We didn't get
      to really finish it.
      But I can try to go
          off my head.
    - Just go for it, okay?
             Ready?
          And action.
      - Nina and Valentina
       move to Hollywood.
         I mean, okay,
     Nina and Tina, sorry.
-So is it Valentina or is it...
        -No, it's Tina.
        Yeah, I'm sorry.
    - Okay, okay, all right.
   You can do it again, baby.
            - Sorry.
       Nina and Valentina
      moved to Hollywood.
   - Is it Valentina or Tina?
            - Tina.
         - Soon after,
       Nina and Valentina
     were finally released
           from jail.
           - [snorts]
    What's your next scene,
             girls?
       So talk us through
  what you're doing right now.
          - All right.
  So right now, she's in jail.
      We're gonna play off
 of each other, just adlibbing.
    -Oh, you're gonna adlib?
       -Yeah, yeah, yeah.
  - There's zero preparation.
       Ready and action.
             - Oh!
      - Girl, let's just--
 we have so much time in here.
       We need to become
          drag queens.
           - [laughs]
          Okay, okay.
     - We need to become...
         -Drag queens.
         -Drag queens.
      - Do you think maybe
  a script would have helped?
            - Yeah.
        - Okay. I think
     we better keep moving.
       - Yeah, let's go.
   All right, talk us through
        this next scene,
            because
     it looks really messy.
       - Trying to learn
       how to do makeup,
     how to pad and things,
    so we're kind of like...
   - With household products.
   - 'Cause we're, you know,
       we're out of jail.
   We're gonna be like, girl,
it shouldn't be hard to do this.
       What, foundation?
      Like, I'm doing her
    with the--this is her--
   - No, I think we should do
        our own makeup.
  Should we do our own makeup
 or should we do each other's?
   - What do you want to do?
     - I think each other,
        but it's on you.
         - Should we do
      each other's makeup?
     - Yeah, it'll be fine,
            I think.
      - All right, ladies,
           you ready?
    - Makeup removal wipes.
  We need to take our lips off
         really quick.
       - Why do you want
       to take them off?
        - Well, because
     we're doing a makeup.
 -Oh, you're gonna put them on.
 -Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
  - I need a Ritalin smoothie
      just to watch this.
         - Oh, my God.
           Tick-tock.
          And action.
     - You know, when times
        were hard, girl,
    a little pancake batter
        went a long way.
         Oh. Oh, girl,
    that is your skin tone.
  You look painted, mama. Oh.
           - [laughs]
      - Oh, I just feel it
       going in my pores.
          Oh, my God.
     Grace Jones realness.
         [both chuckle]
           Ugh, ooh.
        Beat me, bitch.
           - [laughs]
      - All right, ladies,
        your time is up.
    - That was really, um...
         -Interesting.
         -Interesting.
        - I have no idea
  how this is gonna turn out,
      but there's laughter
          in the room,
        and that's what
       we're here to do.
     - I mean, it was very
     entertaining to watch,
          even though
   it was like a train wreck.
         <i> - Coming up...</i>
          Category is
       Club Kid couture.
   - It's okay. The K should
 wear off in about 15 minutes.
          [all laugh]
  [RuPaul laughs, bell rings]
    - It's elimination day,
   and it's time to get ready
 for today's runway, Club Kid.
             - Oh.
  - I've been waiting for this
        the entire time.
        I'm so excited.
       - She's beautiful.
       I want this dress.
           - This is
    one of the first dresses
      I ever wore in drag,
           actually.
    -You think I'm kidding.
    -No, I know you're not,
          but I'm not
     gonna give it to you.
  - Well, if she goes missing,
       I didn't take it.
           - [laughs]
    Good luck fitting in it.
             -Whoo!
           -That ass.
         - Shady bitch.
        - You foundation
     the back of your head?
            - Yeah.
        - Yeah, she does
        her whole head.
   - I contour my head, too,
        when I'm doing,
      like, beauty makeup.
   - What does it do, though?
 You're like, my head's so big,
     I need to contour it.
     - Ooh! Good one, girl.
         - I don't have
      that much experience
        with this whole
        Club Kid thing,
         but I will say
       I'm super excited.
- Have you done a Club Kid look
        before, Trinity?
  - I've never really done it
  because I don't want people
  to, like, laugh at me for--
    Oh, well, that was cute.
  Club Kid drag is completely
    outside my comfort zone,
          so I wanted
    to just be over the top.
- In the nineties, the Club Kids
     changed drag forever.
   They had an influence on,
   like, every type of drag.
   Beauty drag, pageant drag,
   it all has, I think, felt
  the legacy of the Club Kids.
       - Yeah, for sure.
    - It was an underground
         party culture
     that really pushed the
boundaries of queer aesthetics.
   It didn't just shift drag.
      It shifted fashion.
      - I remember seeing
         the Club Kids
           on, like,
      daytime talk shows,
          like Geraldo
     and Sally Jessy, yeah.
- All of them, James St. James,
         Amanda Lepore.
     - And Susanne Bartsch.
     He wasn't exactly part
  of the core New York scene,
 but Leigh Bowery is very much
  the spirit of the Club Kids.
          - Club Kids
   have influenced drag today
        in going beyond
      female impersonation
   and really thinking about
becoming a piece of moving art.
       - Oh, my God. Oh!
              Oh!
         [stomps foot]
             Oh...
   - Are you using hot glue?
             -Yeah.
   -Oh, my God, on your face?
    - Don't burn your skin,
             girl.
         - That's such
      a drag queen sound.
         That pop, pop.
     Sound familiar, Nina?
       - Right. [laughs]
    - Hey, Nina, am I right
     in sort of perceiving
  that you seem to be a little
    lighter in spirit today?
    - No, I'm still cursing
 y'all bitches out in my head.
          [all laugh]
            - Girl.
   - No, I'm good, you know.
  Just sometimes you just need
a little quiet time to yourself.
          - It's nice
      to see you happier.
          - Let's see
       how long it lasts.
        - [laughs] Girl!
          [all laugh]
        [RuPaul laughs]
           And what?
  - Welcome to the main stage
    of "RuPaul's Drag Race."
      My favorite co-star,
        Michelle Visage.
   - I'll always be the Rhoda
         to your Mary.
             - Aw.
        Style superstar
        Carson Kressley.
    Now, have you ever done
            a pilot?
           - I have.
   I can't remember his name.
          [all laugh]
    - Today's special value,
  the stunning Lisa Robertson.
  Lisa, do you like my dress?
      - I love your dress.
     - Good. Well, there's
        only 2,000 left,
         so order now.
           - [laughs]
 - And from "The Real O'Neals,"
          Noah Galvin.
    So excited you're here.
    - I'm very, very excited
          to be here.
     -I don't believe you.
              -No?
    - Give her another take.
     Give her another take.
           This week,
    we challenged our queens
   to create, write, and star
  in their very own TV pilots.
  And tonight, on the runway,
 category is Club Kid Couture.
           Gentlemen,
      start your engines,
  and may the best woman win.
         Category is...
         Sasha Velour,
        clown in a gown.
   I want a Jumbo Jack fries.
     - I'm really enjoying
    this freaky high fashion
        clown character.
          It's so true
    to the Club Kid spirit.
         - Marcel Mar--
     no, she better don't.
     - Don't cry out loud.
          Shea Coulee
     serving Leigh Bowery.
  - That swimsuit's so tight,
      I can read her lips.
          [all laugh]
  - It's like a pearl necklace
       around your mouth.
 - She's really sunk her teeth
      into this challenge.
      - I am bringing you
   twisted Club Kid royalty.
          It's freaky,
    but I know they into it.
  -Is she giving me side-eye?
        -I think she is.
        - Just that one.
         - Nina Bo'nina
      Brown Anderson Lee.
          [all laugh]
    - Your aorta is showing.
    - I'm serving Skeletor,
           bad bitch,
     and I walked backwards
         on the runway.
           So, honey,
       Nina Bo'nina Brown
 is the first to walk backwards
   on the runway, so sue me.
         - Now, that's
        a party monster.
          [all laugh]
           Valentina.
   - I didn't know there was
   a SARS outbreak in Mexico.
          [all laugh]
  - The running of the queens.
           - Tonight,
       I'm very espanola,
     looking like a matador
        with these nails
        and this luxury
   and this fabulous sparkle.
       Like, this is what
   I would do as a Club Kid.
     - She's putting the ho
       in Old El Pas-ho.
          [all laugh]
       - Trinity Taylor.
  - "Fifth Element" realness.
   - I've never actually seen
    a lady with blue balls.
              -No.
             -Hmm.
    - I'm giving you alien,
            robotic,
   venereal disease realness.
    There is no beauty queen
          here, honey.
           -Dat ass.
             -Mmm.
   - It's okay. The K should
 wear off in about 15 minutes.
          [all laugh]
         - Peppermint.
        - How many licks
         does it take?
          [all laugh]
     - BDSM Lollipop Guild.
   - My runway look is a mix
     between the exquisite
          Leigh Bowery
         and the genius
          Klaus Nomi.
      - Curiously strange.
   - Oh, that was refreshing.
          [all laugh]
        Alexis Michelle.
   - I can see her trapezoid.
       - Oh! I think this
     is the perfect outfit
        to be weighed in
    at the doctor's office.
        - [laughs] Yes.
   - I'm not used to showing
       my body like this,
         so this feels
       really empowering.
       I am serving body,
        I'm serving sex,
  and I'm serving graphic art.
            - I see
     her bridge and tunnel.
      [Michelle chuckles]
     - Thank you, Michelle.
         <i> - Coming up...</i>
      - Open wide, ladies.
          - [gagging]
            Swallow!
          [lone clap]
  [RuPaul laughs, bell rings]
           - Welcome
     to the RuTV Up Fronts.
      It's time to screen
   your pilot presentations.
     First up, Sasha Velour
        and Shea Coulee.
       - The year: 1980.
       Meet super glamour
     mama-jamma Teets McGee
  and ex-Commie Russian mommy
         Natasha Asky.
            This duo
   will have to work together
  to defeat the greatest evil
          of all time.
         - Bad fashion.
       Pussy in the lap?
    - [Russian accent] Meow.
     - I'm down with that.
      Pussy on a sweater?
     That deserves a slap.
     - Wearing white after
  international day of labor?
          If you were
     my mother's daughter,
      she would drown you
           in river.
              Ha!
        - Bitch, I said
   where are the Espadrilles?
      Don't make me bring
      your mama into this.
        - But the people
  they end up helping the most
      will be each other.
      - Why are you using
    all these shoulder pads?
  - How else can I make myself
    look like strong woman?
         - Vote, bitch.
    - There will be twists,
    turns, and cliffhangers.
      - Please don't jump.
        You have so much
          to live for.
 - Shea Coulee and Sasha Velour
       are Teets & Asky.
    - See you next Tuesday.
         - At midnight,
        mother [bleep].
           [applause]
     - I can't wait to get
  the Teets & Asky lunch box.
          [all laugh]
  Up next, Valentina and Nina
  Bo'nina Brown Miller-Boyett.
           - [snorts]
        - How you doing?
          You looking
       for some company?
   - Two ladies of the night
     are thrown into jail.
           - [gasps]
      -We've been framed!
      -We've been framed!
    - What are their names?
         Nina and Tina.
        - Put your legs
       behind your head.
      You're under arrest.
             - Oh!
       - And this is how
        it all started.
       Buddy, you'll hear
        from my lawyer.
     Bitch, because of you
         we're in here.
  - I told you to stay on your
    corner where you belong.
          [both gasp]
     -"RuPaul's Drag Race."
     -"RuPaul's Drag Race."
        - I have a plan.
      - The two frenemies
      continued to polish
  all that entails to becoming
America's next drag superstars.
     - Girl, we have to do
         a death drop.
     - One, two, three, go!
           Oh, girl.
         Are you okay?
  - Oh, I thought a death drop
     means you really die.
             - Aah!
       - They finally got
      their drag together
          and competed
    in "RuPaul's Drag Race."
             -Ooh.
             -Damn.
         - Oh, my God.
        - You can catch
         "Nina & Tina"
  on Channel Zero at 4:00 A.M.
          - [chuckles]
          [lone clap]
         - I'm not even
    gonna look at the judges
     'cause I'm quite sure
      they're doing a face
   of what the hell was that.
  So I'm gonna look at the TV
     so I don't see y'all.
     - Last, but not least,
  Trinity Taylor, Peppermint,
      and Alexis Michelle.
    - Two mothers, two sons,
        one holy secret.
          -Oh, my gay!
          -Oh, my gay!
   - Desperate for guidance,
   they turned to the holiest
       mother they know,
       Sister Mary Koont.
      - Our sons are gay.
      -And it's her fault!
      -And it's her fault!
       - Listen, your son
    is always baking cakes.
- Ooh, honey, your son is always
  got something in his mouth.
    - This is not my fault.
      This is your fault.
  - Honey, you ain't no godly
    Christian woman at all.
          - Children!
     You know, Father Ross,
    his breath always smells
        like dick, too.
     - This nun shows them
    how to get closer to God
        through prayer.
  - Ladies, get on your knees.
    - Oh! This doesn't feel
         very ladylike.
        - Mm-hmm. I know
     you know how to do it.
     - Just pray, damn it!
          - Communion.
      - Open wide, ladies.
            - [gags]
           -Swallow!
       -And celebration!
         - Hallelujah!
         - Hallelujah!
     - Starring Peppermint
      as Shaquita Bryant.
        Alexis Michelle
        as Freda Phelps.
         Trinity Taylor
     as Sister Mary Koont.
  Tune in to see if tolerance
        goes balls deep
   on "Mary, Mother of Gay."
           [applause]
         - Oh, hallelu.
       Ladies, I've made
        some decisions.
         <i> - Coming up...</i>
     - Frankly, the clever
   word play and the writing
    I do think came from me.
      - I have to speak up
           right now.
     That is not the case.
  [RuPaul laughs, bell rings]
       - Ladies, based on
    your pilot presentations
   and your Club Kid couture,
   I've made some decisions.
   Sasha Velour, Shea Coulee.
       Con-drag-ulations.
       You're the winners
   of this week's challenge.
        You've each won
   a $1,000 gift certificate
     from The Spa On Rodeo,
     and a sickening supply
     of hair care products
      provided by Aquage.
      And the hair doesn't
    have to be on your head.
          [all laugh]
            - Good.
   - You may leave the stage.
   - Yes. We the dream team.
         - Oh, my God.
     it's actually amazing
to win working with Shea again.
         I'm so happy.
   - That means you're all up
        for elimination.
         Now it's time
    for the judge's reviews,
starting with Nina Bo'nina Brown
       Stuart Masterson.
- Tonight on the runway, I love
  what you did with your face.
    Your makeup is intense.
      It's really insane.
         - But I think
        the torso part,
   it looks a little bit like
    an afterthought for me.
   - I wanted to paint this,
    like, elaborate ribcage,
but didn't have time, so I just
  kind of did what I could do.
          - Let's talk
      about "Nina & Tina."
            - Okay.
     - I felt like you guys
   came with no preparation.
         I really wish
       you had a script.
          - Shows like
     "Curb Your Enthusiasm"
    are completely improv'd,
but they always have a structure
       so they don't just
       fly off the rails.
          -Valentina.
            -Hello.
       - Your runway look
    I think is spectacular.
   - But I'm getting way more
high fashion than I am Club Kid.
  And in the acting challenge,
     same thing goes here.
       I didn't feel like
    you guys were prepared,
    and I feel like you guys
        kind of wandered
         until you got
     to where it was going.
     - It sort of felt like
         a movie to me.
   There has to be a formula
 that you can fill every week,
   so it can't be wrapped up
    after the first episode.
   - Up next, Trinity Taylor.
     - I have to say, that
  is my favorite runway look.
      It is so well done.
     - This was really hard
            for me.
   You know, it's not easy to
 look like a venereal disease.
          [all laugh]
- Everything about it rings true
      to Club Kid for me.
           I love it.
        It's super fun.
        Let's talk about
         Sister Koont.
        You went for it.
          - Children!
       - And you ended up
    being the scene stealer.
     - You took directions
        so beautifully,
     and the moment we said
       go bigger with it,
        you embraced it
  and you were the comedy gold
   of "Mary, Mother of Gay."
       Really well done.
      - Thank you so much.
           - Up next,
     hard candy Peppermint.
- I'll never forget who you are
    because of your outfit.
       It's so on brand.
        - This is really
      bringing back, like,
    The Tunnel and Club USA
  and all those great places.
          - Thank you.
            - I like
    that it's over the top.
  - She could also leave here
 and go to "Let's Make A Deal."
       What I loved about
     "Mary, Mother of Gay"
    was that it was totally
      actual sitcom beats.
             Like,
    when they said the name
         and you looked
      at the camera like.
    You did the voiceovers.
    You committed completely
         to your role.
       I thought you did
       a really good job.
          -Thank you.
   -Up next, Alexis Michelle.
             - Hi.
    - Tonight on the runway,
     not my favorite look.
     It is a body stocking
       with a corset on.
       This is beautiful,
     your hair and makeup.
          -Thank you.
     -It's just almost like
     it doesn't make sense
  with the rest of the outfit.
  They're two different looks.
    - In terms of the pilot,
 your performance, for me, did
sort of get lost in the shuffle.
     - Maybe your character
       didn't pop as much
      because you took on
  a lot of the producer role.
   - I want to say something,
and I don't intend by any means
     to throw my beautiful
   teammates under for this.
      But I do think that
   a lot of the organization
    and, frankly, the clever
    wordplay and the writing
    I do think came from me.
    In trying to keep things
     running and organized,
  I may have taken a back seat
 in the size of my performance.
      - I have to speak up
           right now.
  The way that this discussion
         is going down,
     it sounds like Alexis
 was the producer of our pilot.
     That is not the case.
          You were not
       the only person--
  - I didn't mean to say that.
           - That was
      writing things down.
   The three of us did put in
   a balanced amount of work.
  - I also felt that there was
  a little bit of me, me, me.
 Peppermint felt very strongly
   about doing the voiceover.
     - Okay. I did say that
 I wanted to do the voiceover,
    but you could have said,
     before we go to shoot,
  let's talk about this again.
        - It wasn't much
        of a discussion.
  It felt like it was claimed.
        - I want to say
       one thing as well.
   As a team, all three of us
put in the same amount of work.
    It was all of our ideas.
  - And please let me repeat,
 I was not trying to throw you
     under, either of you.
        But in focusing
       on administration,
     my performance was not
 the same size as my co-stars.
      - Thank you, ladies.
      We've heard enough.
  While you untuck backstage,
        the judges and I
        will deliberate.
  All right, now, just between
       us network execs,
          let's start
      with "Nina & Tina."
- This was a difficult challenge
     for Nina and Valentina
            because
    it was very structured,
     and I don't feel like
they're very structured people.
      - They were spinning
    their wheels in the mud.
    They were going nowhere,
         and they were
      going nowhere fast.
   However, could I sit there
 and watch them do it forever?
             - Aah!
          -Absolutely.
             -Sure.
       - I mean, this is
     a Night at the Improv
    you don't want to miss.
 - I'm just really disappointed
         with these two
        because there's
      so much comedy gold
that could be made into a sitcom
   with these two characters.
  This week on "Nina & Tina,"
       the old prostitute
        from Chattanooga
   teaches the girls a lesson
   about hot water cornbread.
   Michelle, write this down.
          I think this
     is a really good idea.
      -I got it, I got it.
          -Yeah, good.
        Trinity Taylor.
          - As far as
       Sister Mary Koont,
    she went for it balls to
  the wall and she delivered.
   Tonight was a great night
          for Trinity.
     - Although I do think
        that she really
     committed to the part,
    the pilot that they did
     is my least favorite.
    - Listen, it was cliché
     and not that original.
       I think the show's
      gonna be a big hit.
          [all laugh]
          Peppermint.
     - Everything that you
    need to do in a sitcom,
       I think Peppermint
           delivered.
   - And she really nailed it
       in the voiceover.
         -That's true.
     -Because that's really
          set the tone
      for the whole piece.
             -Yeah.
       -Alexis Michelle.
    - She was very prepared,
        knew her lines.
 - I don't like that she turned
  on her teammates like that.
       - I just feel like
     she was making excuses
    for why her performance
       didn't pop for us.
     At the end of the day,
 you just have to be memorable
      in the presentation,
        and she wasn't.
          [clap, clap]
           - Silence.
     I've made my decision.
      Bring back my girls.
  [RuPaul laughs, bell rings]
    - Welcome back, ladies.
   I've made some decisions.
  Peppermint, Trinity Taylor,
 your performances were crass,
       crude and clichéd.
       You're both safe.
           -[laughs]
          -Thank you.
         - You may join
        the other girls.
      Nina Bo'nina Brown,
 your skeletal look is killer,
      but you really boned
          your pilot.
    I'm sorry, my dear, but
   you're up for elimination.
      - I already knew it.
       Call me Miss Cleo.
  - Valentina, on the runway,
    you gave us Spanish fly,
  but your pilot didn't land.
 Alexis Michelle, at this point
      in the competition,
       there's no excuse
     for not standing out.
         - Oh, my God.
- Alexis Michelle, your prayers
      have been answered.
          You're safe.
          You may join
        the other girls.
          - Thank you.
     - Valentina, my dear,
           I'm sorry,
         but you are up
        for elimination.
  Two queens stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last chance
         to impress me
       and save yourself
       from elimination.
      The time has come...
           [thunder]
      for you to lip sync
    [echoing] for your life.
     - Nothing can explain
        what I'm feeling
     as I'm waiting to have
    to lip sync for my life.
          I'm scared.
          - Good luck
     and don't fuck it up.
            - Stop.
       Hold up, hold up.
       All right, enough.
         [music stops]
 Valentina, this is a lip sync
         for your life.
   We need to see your lips.
        Take that thing
       off of your mouth.
   - I'd like to keep it on,
            please.
       - It's a lip sync.
       What part of that
     do you not understand?
            - Okay.
    - So we're gonna reset.
             Okay.
    Lip sync for your life,
           take two.
     - Oh, she doesn't know
           the words.
       - In this moment,
  my mind is just at a blank.
   I don't remember the song.
   I just want to disappear.
     - Yes, yes, yes, whoo!
              Yes!
           [applause]
          - [sobbing]
           - Ladies,
     I've made my decision.
      Nina Bo'nina Brown,
       shantay, you stay.
          - Thank you.
         - You can join
        the other girls.
           Valentina,
  I thought you had the stuff
       to go all the way.
        Now sashay away.
          - Thank you.
   I'm so humiliated tonight.
   I want to be here so bad.
      I don't want to go.
            [crying]
       <i> Los quiero mucho.</i>
        I never imagined
        this was the way
   that it was going to end.
            [sighs]
       I wanted to leave
    putting up a good fight,
      and that's something
   I wasn't able to do today.
   But I don't want to leave
     feeling disappointed.
      I want to leave here
       feeling grateful.
  - My queens, never give up.
         And remember,
  if you can't love yourself,
        how in the hell
 you gonna love somebody else?
           Can I get
      an amen up in here?
             -Amen!
             -Amen!
          - All right.
    Now let the music play.


          <i> - Previously</i>

     - Grandrea Zuckerwoman

         - I don't want
         to be Grandrea.
   - If it's going to be that
   tense, I'll take Grandrea.
            -Action.
            -Action.

      - You weren't really
       selling the lines.
  - Where are the cool people?
              -Aja.
  -You were playing the bitch,
    and it felt kind of flat
             for me.
    You basically handed Shea
       a moment to shine.
        - Trinity Taylor,
        you're the winner
    of this week's challenge.
       Nina Bo'nina Brown,
       shantay, you stay.
        Aja, sashay away.
         - Oh, that was
   a rough, rough one, honey.
             -Whoo.
              -Oh.
      - I feel heartbroken.
    Aja was my Brooklyn boo,
     and I'm really, really
         gonna miss her.
        - "Love you guys.
           XOXO, Aja."
              -Aw.
              -Aw.
    - Anybody got any Windex?
           - [laughs]
   The truth is, I'm thrilled
  to see the room thinning out
because I know I'm the contender
      in this competition.
       - Aren't y'all two
       neck and neck now?
     - Well, I have two wins
        and she has a win
    and then a partnered win.
              -Ooh!
              -Ooh!
     - But also, weren't you
       in the bottom two?
     And I never even landed
   in the bottom three, bitch.
           What's up?
              - Oh.
             -Ouch.
              -Oh!
           [all laugh]
     - I'm kind of jealous.
       I want to win, too.
          'Cause we're
        at the point now
    where if you haven't won
 at least one challenge, then...
        why are you here?
  - Well, how do you feel being
    told that you're perfect?
             Again.
         - They told you
         you're perfect?
    - One day, she'll run out
         of perfection.
      - Yeah, we'd all like
        to be in the top,
     but the cookie doesn't
    always crumble that way.
          - Thank you,
        JonBenet Ramsey.
           [all laugh]
        - At this point,
   there's only two girls who
have not won any challenges yet,
     Peppermint and Farrah.
    That ain't a good thing.
    - Hey, Farrah, thanks for
looking like a drag queen today.
           [all laugh]
         - Peppermint's

     are for sure numbered.

       Nina Bo'nina Brown,
      your pads are so big,
      you bend down to pick
   something up off the street
  and the garbage man says, who
  left this raggedy couch here?

         is on Sundays.

         all those mens

  they're not your boyfriends.
      They're called johns,
   and they're your employers.

              -Ooh.
        Shea-Shea Coulee,
  you sure are a scene stealer.
  I guess gnawing on set pieces

        - That felt good.
           -Valentina.
             -Yeah.
         - Your wardrobe
    sure does look expensive,
   but money can't buy talent.
              -Ooh.
              -Hey!
    - Farrah. You really are
     the social media queen.
 Too bad you can't get a filter
      for that personality.
              -Oh!
              -Oh.
 - Peppermint, you assassinated

   but you're also very broad.
         Trinity Taylor,
         I once told you
    that you're so beautiful
         inside and out.
   I lied, you ugly stripper.

      have a lot in common.
      He's bald, you bald.
        He wear glasses,
        you wear glasses.
           He's rich--
           Never mind.
           [all laugh]
   Alexis, you're like a BMW.
        Body made wrong.
              - Oh!
     - Valentina, you think
     you're Miss Venezuela,
      but you're more like
        Miss Quinceañera.
           - Oh, man.
       - Alexis Michelle,
        Pillsbury called.
   They want their rolls back.
              -Ooh.
              -Oh.
    - Okay, that's all I got.
    - Thank you, Farrah Moan.
            -Farrah.
        -I can't do that.
         - Oh, you did.
          - The library
      is officially closed.
         Now, you're all
          avid readers,
         but one of you
     is the head librarian.
           Valentina.
        - Oh, you did it!
 - You've won a four-night stay
       for you and a guest
  at the Saguaro Palm Springs.
   - Oh, I love Palm Springs.
   - Now, reading one another
         do take nerve,
          but you need
     titanium balls and tits
   to read a legendary queen.
       So for this week's
         maxi challenge,
     we're bringing back...
       <i> The RuPaul Roast.</i>
              -Oh.
              -Oh.
         - #RuPaulRoast.
    But this time, our guest
    of dishonor won't be me.
           The person
    you'll be roasting is...
        Michelle Visage.
           [all cheer]
          And get this.
        She has no idea.
            -[gasps]
          -Oh, my God.
 - Now, Valentina, since you won
     the reading challenge,
     you'll decide the order
       of the presenters.
     And a word of warning,
             ladies.
     Michelle never forgets.
          [evil laugh]
      So don't fuck it up.
           [applause]
             - Whoo!
      - Here we go, y'all.
    - What are you thinking,
           Valentina?
    - Do you know what order
       you want to go in?
       - I want to go just
    somewhere in the middle.
    - Valentina, I know that,
      like, first and last
            are like
     the hardest positions,
        and I don't mind
       either one of them.
     - Okay. So going first,
     it's going to be Shea.
          - All right.
 - Second is going to be Sasha.
             - Okay.
     - Third is going to be
      the one and only me.
     Going fourth, Trinity.
         Fifth, Farrah.
       Sixth, Peppermint.
  Seventh, Nina Bo'nina Brown.
      And closing our show
           is Alexis.
          - Time for us
     to start writing jokes.
           Be clever.
        That's the goal.
         - Here's a tip.
  Don't make it about my body.
         - Oh, my Lord.
       - I was surprised.
      You guys came from--
  anything to do with my size.
          I just, like,
      would have preferred
   not to do with body image.
   So that's all I have to say
           about that.
            - People,
     we can't be sensitive.
    It's a comedy challenge.
      - Girl, get over it.
         You knew people
     were going to read you.
  You made fun of other people.
           Calm down.
   You're a drag queen, honey.
   - I'm sorry about my joke.
   - I don't want you to feel
     that I think it's okay
   to make you feel that way.
    - I feel like right now,
     Alexis is in her head,
        and I'm concerned
      that she's not going
     to take it far enough.
   And for a roast to be good,
    you gotta go all the way.
         <i> - Coming up...</i>
     - Everybody's nervous.
              -Oh.
              -Oh.
         <i> No digo nada.</i>
          - Bye, bitch.
   [RuPaul laughs, bell rings]
         [RuPaul laughs]
              - Oh.
          - Oh, my God.
     - We have to do a roast
       of Michelle Visage.
       Oh, my fucking God.
      Everybody's nervous.
 - Aja, you might have got lucky
      getting out of here.
         - I am frozen,
    and I'm not even talking
         about my face.
       - So I have my pen
           in one hand
       and I have my hand
      on a piece of paper,
        and I just think.
         And... nothing.
              Oh...
<i>Virgen de Gaudalupe, por favor,</i>
    <i> ayúdame en este momento</i>
      <i> porque no digo nada.</i>
  - Girl, Guadalupe ain't gonna
   write these jokes for you.
         You gotta do it
    for your own self, girl.
         So get to work.
          - [whimpers]
            - Hello.
              -Hi!
             -Hello.
              - Hi.
  - I brought Ross to help you
       with your material.
  - This is my first time ever
        in the workroom.
        Do you know that?
        - You're kidding.
        Oh, my goodness,
         well, welcome.
        - It's just like
         I pictured it.
           [all laugh]
       - Alexis Michelle.
         -Hi, gentlemen.
              -Hi.
     - Now, a little birdie
        told me that you
    were a little miffed off
    by the reading challenge.
        - I just thought
       some of my sisters
     could have come up with
     more original material.
              - Oh.
   You were more disappointed
          than miffed.
     - No, the truth is, Ru,
       body image has been
  something I've struggled with
      for a lot of my life.
        And I have talked
         with my sisters
          and they know
    what I've struggled with.
        That's why it was
   a little bit, um, hurtful.
- So you feel like it's okay for
you to make fun of someone else,
      but not someone else
       to make fun of you.
     - Um, look, I will try,
            you know,
   whenever I come for anybody
         on that runway,
        to make sure that
  we're all laughing together.
       - Right. But that's
     the thing about comedy.
    You know, a lot of times,
  especially people who've been
   through hell and high water
         with an issue,
          the only way
        to get through it
   is to friggin' laugh at it.
         - Laugh at it,
          that's true.
     - Mm-hmm. 'Cause look,
          you survived.
             - Yeah.
   - Have you ever done comedy
             before?
            - I have.
  Actually, at my weekly show,
      I spend a lot of time
           on the mic.
      - And you're actually
    going last in the lineup.
   How do you feel about that?
          - I honestly
      was ready to open her
        and set the tone
        or close her out
   and, uh, let them eat cake.
       - Okay. All right.
    - Well, listen, you have
       experience in this.
              A lot
    of the other girls don't.
 And because you do, we're going
 to need you to bring it extra.
          - All right.
    We'll see you out there.
         Make us laugh.
            See you.
             - Bye.
       -Hey, Farrah Moan.
            -Oh, hi.
         - Now, you did
      the reading earlier.
     How'd that go for you?
      - Honestly, I really
      didn't like doing it.
     You know, I did go for
 a low blow with Alexis Michelle
    and it did not feel good.
   - Now, are you more worried
     about what other people
       will think of you?
    - I just am more worried
       about staying true
         to my integrity
     and not hurting anyone.
     - You're 12. What kind
    of integrity do you have?
           - [laughs]
            I get it.
          I would go on
  <i> Chelsea Lately</i> all the time,
    and that show was really
  about tearing down Hollywood.
  And my nature is to be nice,
            so I'd be
      the one in the corner
        going, but I like
        Jessica Simpson,
     you know, trying to...
             - Oh...
      - But it can be done.
    Lube her up a little bit.
             - Yeah.
     - You know what I mean?
  I love you, Michelle, but...
        - Uh-huh, uh-huh.
      - I'm the biggest fan
   of Michelle Visage, but...
        - Yeah, exactly.
    - Then it's not as mean.
            -Totally.
   -Except it's totally mean.
         - Yeah, right.
      Now, you haven't won
         any challenges.
            - I know.
     - Because at this point
       in the competition,
       if you haven't won
         any challenges,
         you may wind up
         in the bottom.
    - Oh, don't say that, Ru.
     -You gotta come for it.
             -Okay?
   - All right, make us laugh.
             - Yeah.
            -By-eee.
            -By-eee.
            [laughs]
    Hey, Pep-Pep-Peppermint.
       - Hey, yo, yo, Ru.
        -Hi. How are you?
        -Ross, hey, baby.
        -Good to see you.
        -Now, obviously,
     Michelle is the target
         of this roast.
      Does this scare you?
      Does this excite you?
      - It scares the shit
           out of me.
       - Tell me about it.
      - I've never roasted
         anyone before.
    - Are you a funny queen?
          - I think so.
         I mean, I think
       people will laugh.
       - I think you are,
 but so far in this competition,
     you've had some trouble
    getting out of the gate,
          so to speak.
  - I feel like it's more like
    crossing the finish line.
       - Okay, all right.
       - Ding, ding, dong.
    Are you hungry for a win?
         - I'm starving,
      and this is the time.
    - Well, that's up to you.
           All right,
       thanks, Peppermint.
          Sasha Velour.
           - Hi, guys.
    - Now, you're very smart.
      You're intellectual.
  How are you going to pull off
         a gutter roast?
    - I feel like my worries
      about not being funny
  have been getting in my way.
    - Are you funny in life?
   - That's the big question.
      I make people laugh,
        but in my shows,
         my edge is that
   it's serious and analytical
   and has a bit of philosophy
          and politics.
         - You gotta use
          what you got.
     Maybe you can use this
   sort of intellectual thing
     to make fun of yourself
   and then go after Michelle.
    You know what I'm saying?
          - Yeah, yeah.
   Now, how's the joke writing
          coming along?
- I'm having some writer's block
         with this one.
   - Well, time's running out.
            -I know.
  -Have you written any jokes?
    - I've written the words
    "mutton dressed as lamb."
           [all laugh]
        Which could apply
       to a lot of people.
             - Yeah.
      - This is going to be
        very interesting.
        - Just make sure
       you make us laugh.
          - Absolutely.
   - And don't forget, please,
         make us laugh.
           [all laugh]
            -See you.
            -See you.
          - All right,
    listen up, pretty girls.
    Roast them good, ladies.
            -Mm-hmm.
            -[laughs]
         Let's go, Ross.
          - Okay, bye.
         Bye, bye, bye.
             - Whoo!
    - So mutton is old sheep.
       - Okay, okay, okay.
    - And lamb is baby sheep.
     But also people use it
           to describe
     when someone who is old
           is dressing
       to appear younger.
         - Okay. Mm-mm.
          [both laugh]
           Bye, bitch.
            [laughs]
         <i> - Coming up...</i>
    We challenged our queens
    to perform in the second
         <i> RuPaul Roast,</i>
     but our guest of honor
      isn't going to be me.
   [RuPaul laughs, bell rings]
         [RuPaul laughs]
  - This week's maxi challenge
       is the<i> RuPaul Roast</i>
     and this time, we'll be
    roasting Michelle Visage.
            -Farrah?
              -Yes.
    - I'm sorry I insinuated
     you were a prostitute.
     - Oh, thank you, baby.
            I'm sorry
    I made fun of your rolls,
          and I'm sorry
     for bringing it up now.
           [all laugh]
   - I'm sure that your johns
    are really lovely people.
              - Oh.
             -Whoo!
             -Whoo!
          - Okay, girl.
           [all laugh]
       - There's moments,
            you guys,
          where, like,
       there's a joke said
    and then everybody laughs
        and I look around
      and just start, like,
      laughing to blend in.
           [all laugh]
    - That was my experience.
       When I first lived
           in Russia,
    humor in another language
       is so challenging.
           - How long
       did you live there?
   - I lived there for, like,
      two and a half years
           altogether.
          - Oh, my God.
     I got stuck in Moscow.
     I was presenting female
    and my ID does not match.
   And I was in Moscow airport
        for a connection,
    I think, like 30 minutes.
   This was eight months ago.
          - Oh, my God.
        - And so we land
    and we're supposed to go
   to the little transfer desk
          or whatever.
         And the woman,
  she didn't speak any English,
    and she just kept looking
   at my ID and looking at me.
        And it was clear
    that she was disagreeing
       with the fact that
        my ID looked male
      and I looked female.
  Okay, so that's what it was.
       So she detained me.
            - Oh, my.
    That's really terrifying.
        - I was terrified
          to the point
      where I had to snatch
     my own wig off my head
           in the line
     with all these people.
          - Oh, my God.
     - Just to prove to her
           that I'm...
           this is me
    and please let me go in.
     It was so humiliating.
   - That's really a tragedy.
          There's a lot
    of gender fear in Russia.
             -Yeah.
        -I feel for her.
  When I was living in Russia,
    I had to disguise myself.
   I couldn't be Sasha Velour.
 I had to think carefully about
   what clothes I was wearing,
      how I moved my body.
   Queer people in Russia are
 living in an oppressive system.
        - I just have to
          keep in mind
    that it doesn't take away
          my womanhood.
             -Amen.
            -A-woman.
           [all laugh]

 - Welcome to the second annual
        <i> RuPaul's Roast.</i>
    This year, we are really
      switching things up.
       Instead of RuPaul,
      we are going to roast
     a man of true charisma,
           uniqueness,
        nerve and talent.
        [Michelle laughs]
         Unfortunately,
       he was unavailable,
       so it's going to be
        Michelle Visage.
 Michelle, we know you for being
     a kind, patient she-ro.
      And gonorrhea clinics
    know you as Patient Zero.
           [all laugh]
       Girl, you have had
        more shit in you
          than a urinal
       at Dodger Stadium.
     The only difference is
       they get cleaned up
       after a grand slam.
   Well, ladies and gentlemen,
         just remember,
  if you liked my performance,
     my name is Shea Coulee.
      And if you hated it,
    it's Nina Bo'nina Brown.
           [all laugh]
      [cheers and applause]
    - Thank you, Shea Coulee.
       That was extremely
         edifying humor.
      Uh, sorry, am I using
      that word correctly?
          Not edifying.
        I know that one.
 It was humor that I wasn't sure
     worked in this context.
   Tonight, we really do have
         an opportunity
      to salute empowering
  representation in the media.
    We have an out and proud
        lesbian comedian.
       Thank you so much,
          Ross Mathews.
           [all laugh]
    Ross Mathews has the face
       of a young gay man
          and the voice
       of an adult woman.
         So the opposite
        of Tamar Braxton.
           [all laugh]
            - Bitch.
      I'm gonna get yo ass.
  - It's now come time to talk
 about Michelle Visage herself.
     Michelle is so Jersey,
   her idea of classical music
          is Lisa Lisa.
             - Hey!
        - Michelle Visage
          is so Jersey,
    she calls her pubic hair
  the Garden State Expressway.
 And let's not even get started
     on the Holland Tunnel.
             - Whoo.
      Michelle Visage is--
      I have more of these.
         Michelle Visage
          is so Jersey,
     she wanted to call her
   second child White Flight.
    Oh, well. That one worked
           in my mind.
  And now, a queen who combines
  all the excitement of smiling
         with the thrill
     of just standing there.
           [all laugh]
    Give it up for Valentina.
      [cheers and applause]
         - Mama RuPaul,
   you are the shadiest queen
 because you let Michelle Visage
   look so busted on Season 3
            and 4...
    and 5 and 6 and 7 and 8.
           [all laugh]
            And girl,
       that's your friend.
        That's fucked up.
   Michelle is such a<i> cochina</i>
       that she knows how
    to say and spell "harder"
   in six different languages.
            Michelle,
   you is such a tired-ass ho
 that when you got carpal tunnel
 from giving out free hand job,
  she just became left-handed.
       - I'm so confused.
   - Ross, you're just so cute
          and so sweet.
       You just remind me
       of a cute hamster.
    I just want to shove you
           up my butt.
              Boo!
      - [exaggerated drawl]
       Thank you, Paydro,
         mo-wee bee-in.
           <i> (muy bien)</i>
          Please excuse
      the way I'm dressed.
 I have to go feed the chickens
           after this,
    and I didn't want to wear
         my good things.
      I sometimes even have
    to wrestle a few of them.
  Michelle, you know all about
   wrestling cocks, don't you?
             I think
    we have a lot in common,
      from the same tastes
          in hairspray
        to the same units
        of Botox fillers,
   lips, tucks, nips and hips.
      Michelle, every time
       I walk the runway,
   you have this pungent look
          on your face,
          kind of like
        you got to shit.
       I reckon they have
    some laxatives for that.
         Just a secret.
          We all poop.
           [applause]
     - Let's get this roast
           a-cookin'.
         [clears throat]
          Can we please
     put our hands together
      for the one, the only
  Michelle Visage...'s breasts?
      They're the real star
          of the show.
         Sorry, RuPaul.
    Hmm. I find it hilarious
      that Michelle Visage
  judges a talent competition.
     I don't know about you,
   but don't you actually have
   to have talent to do that?
     Ha. And I'm pretty sure
 having one song in the nineties
   that no one even remembers
       doesn't qualify you
          to be a judge
     on such a big TV show.
  Good thing she's been sucking
   RuPaul's dick for so long.
              -Oh.
             -Whoo!
       - Oh, and we've got
   Tamar Braxton in the house.
        Tay-mar Braxton.
       However you say it.
    She's Toni Braxton's less
 talented, more annoying sister.
    [clears throat] Anyways,
 now that Michelle's dick breath
          has stunk up
       this entire stage,
 I'd like to introduce our next
  minty contestant, Peppermint.
      [cheers and applause]
          - Hey, y'all.
     Thank you, Farrah Moan.
           [all laugh]
       Ross, everyone says
   that your voice is annoying
        and high-pitched,
       but I actually love
   the sound of your voice...
           right now.
           - [laughs]
             - Shh!
     Don't talk, don't talk.
        Michelle Visage,
       Michelle, Michelle.
    Not since Destiny's Child
 has a Michelle become so famous
           for riding
   somebody else's coattails.
           [all laugh]
       RuPaul, all smiles,
        Ross, all smiles,
      Michelle, poker face.
         No, seriously.
     Someone poke her face.
      It doesn't even move.
        Michelle says no
         to everything.
            Michelle,
     you like my dress? No.
     You like my makeup? No.
             Bitch,
     where the hell were you
   when somebody asked you if
 you wanted to write that book?
           [all laugh]
  It's a great book, Michelle.
          Said no one.
           [all laugh]
    Honestly, I fell in love
       with you, Michelle,
     watching you and RuPaul
             on VH1,
   and I'm so honored to share
      this moment with you,
          so thank you.
      Happy 90th birthday,
            Michelle.
      [cheers and applause]
         - Hey, babies.
   It's me, Mother Maybelline
   Nina Bo'nina Banana Fofana
     Osama bin Laden Brown's
           great aunt.
     Coming all the way from
  the lions, tigers and bears,
      and sheep of the Lord
   Missionary Baptist Church.
        Praise the Lord.
            Moving on
     to the man of the hour,
       RuPaul's secretary
        Michelle Visayge.
       You know, Michelle,
 your face reminds me of my hip.
             Stiff.
           Oh, Jesus.
     What's your name, baby?
      [laughter and groans]
             You are
      a whole lotta woman.
             Mm-hmm.
     Well, we normally save
       the best for last,
    but in this case, we had
 to settle for Alexis Michelle.
           [applause]
         - Oh, Michelle,
       Michelle, Michelle.
   In honor of your big night,
   I wore your favorite color,
         girl. [laughs]
              Um...
   We have so much in common,
            Michelle.
   We have the theater running
     in our veins, Michelle.
 You also have several venereal
 diseases running through yours,
           but that's
   besides the point. [laughs]
   But, you know, you're also
 an inspiration to me, Michelle.
   As thin as you have become,
       one area has stayed
      the same, unchanged.
    It's a Hanukkah miracle,
         <i> Baruch HaShem.</i>
    Oh, my goodness, Fortune.
       You also know about
     playing second fiddle.
       You've been playing
            bullshit
      to Chelsea Handler's
  alcoholic WASP for ages now.
         Now, Michelle,
   I have to congratulate you
      on really being able
        to take the piss.
         Just ask the UK
     men's water polo team.
             - Okay.
    - She loves water sports.
        She loves the UK.
     And we love you, mama.
           Thank you,
      ladies and gentlemen.
         It's been real.
     Good night, everybody.
      [scattered applause]
          - This is not
         a happy ending.
    - And it don't help that
     you look like She Hulk.
         <i> - Coming up...</i>
    - The jokes, they seemed
     more like observations.
     - You just looked like
   you were going to throw up.
       - This is a roast.
     You go hard or go home.
   [RuPaul laughs, bell rings]
         [RuPaul laughs]
       - Welcome, ladies.
    I've made some decisions.
       Nina Bo'nina Brown
           Earl Jones.
           Valentina.
      You ladies are safe.
    You may leave the stage.
          Now it's time
   for the judges' critiques.
           Let's start
        with Shea Coulee.
  - I know a thing or two about
  being somebody's opening act.
             - Yeah.
    - And, you know, you just
     set the tone, you know,
  to be funny, to be original.
        - And your jokes
       were really funny.
  I'm probably gonna steal them
and put them in my next special.
          - Have them.
          - Thank you.
      You did a great job.
          - Thank you.
    - Next up, Sasha Velour.
       - When you started
           the roast,
        I think you were
   way too smart for the room.
         But the minute
   you started laying into me,
     it was friggin' genius.
           - You have
      a very specific POV.
   You know, what does a roast
 look like through Sasha's eyes?
           And I think
    you gave us that tonight.
        - Trinity Taylor.
     - What I liked was that
      you had a character.
        - Mo-wee bee-in.
      - But everything else
       didn't work for me.
  - You didn't have the jokes.
      - I think even before
        you got up there,
      you just looked like
    you were gonna throw up,
          and you still
     kind of have that look.
  - It's the Botox, I promise.
           - Oh, okay.
       See, that's funny.
     And, like, I would have
     liked to have seen you
  sort of trust yourself more.
     - Up next, Farrah Moan.
            - Farrah,
     nothing landed, honey.
    If you're gonna be harsh,
         it has to land.
And I think everything that came
  out of your mouth was harsh.
     That's not a bad thing.
          It's a roast.
   But you gotta follow it up
       with a punch line.
      People have to laugh.
      - Yeah, I fucked up.
      - I wouldn't call it
        fucked up, but--
  - I would call it fucked up.
             - Okay.
     - Because we identified
  the problem in the workroom.
       You said being mean
        is not my nature.
  But if you don't like to say
       that person sucks,
          you can say,
    I love Michelle so much,
    I was dying to meet her.
    And she was exactly like
       I'd hoped she'd be,
     horrible in every way.
    It would have been a POV
            that none
     of the other girls had.
      - All right, up next,
       Pep-Pep-Peppermint.
        - So by the time
          you came up,
      I was hungry for just
     a good piece of roast,
       and you served it.
       - I was like Ross,
    just waiting for somebody
     to just come out there
      and bring the energy.
     And you just killed it.
    - And you look beautiful.
        It just all works
         for me tonight.
        - I would totally
        take you to prom.
           [all laugh]
       - Alexis Michelle.
 - My question the whole entire
    time is why is she green?
  - Well, Tamar, have you ever
        watched the show?
        - But going green
          like you did,
           I expected
      like a Broadway thing
         'cause you look
          like Elphaba.
      And then, like, this
    Jersey accent comes out.
    - She likes water sports.
   - I was like, I don't know
           what to do
     with these two things.
      - I literally forgot
   there was an audience here.
  That's how silent they were.
  - And the jokes, they seemed
     more like observations.
   -You were almost too soft.
             -Yeah.
     - It was like you were
      afraid of hurting us.
        This is a roast.
     You go hard or go home.
      - Thank you, ladies.
   While you untuck backstage,
        the judges and I
        will deliberate.
       [car engine starts]
   All right, now just between
      us squirrel friends,
       what do you think?
          Shea Coulee.
           - I thought
      she set a great tone.
       She didn't shy away
         from her jokes.
          I was a fan.
      - But on the runway,
  is it the most creative look
        we've ever seen?
         - Sasha Velour.
    - I was panicked for her.
    Then she got this formula
     that she just inserted
   the jokes in and it worked.
     - The way she was like
       analytical at first
    didn't bother me because
   it worked with her outfit,
        and she was funny
         on top of that.
 You know, she was really smart
       about being smart.
      - Yeah, it was a real
  breakthrough moment for her.
         Trinity Taylor.
      - The father, the son
       and the holy ghost.
             -Yeah.
    -We're not with Trinity.
              -No.
           -Not today.
           - The jokes
   just weren't strong enough.
             -Yeah.
       -It was road kill.
           - [laughs]
       That's good eatin'.
        - But the outfit
          was on point.
       It was super cute.
    I'm from North Carolina,
         so I felt like
        she fit right in
   with my white trash people.
         - Farrah Moan.
   - I thought she reminded me
        of Marilyn Monroe
     when she did the whole
     birthday thing for JFK.
          And I thought
      she was gonna come up
   and do her whole character
       [breathy] like this
   and it would've been funny.
     But what it came across
     as a really nervous kid
   who came to tell people off
         in a harsh way.
     - You know, it hit me.
      She would be perfect
        at doing Elvira.
       She's got the same
     sort of vocal cadence.
      - You know, the fact
     that everybody's like,
     oh, you look like this,
       you look like this
means probably who she really is
      isn't coming through.
  - I think Fortune brought up
       such a good point.
  She doesn't know who she is.
            - At all.
  - She knows she's a cute girl
  and can wear pretty clothes.
             - Yeah.
   - But there's nothing more
         than that yet.
      - All right. So let's
     move on to Peppermint.
             Tonight
      she was really funny.
    - Not only was she funny,
     but she looked probably
  the best we've ever seen her.
        She was literally
       a smiling assassin.
      - Really, seriously.
   From the hair, the makeup,
  the gown, to the funny jokes,
        I really, really
          enjoyed her.
    Like, she was really the
 highlight of the evening to me.
       - Alexis Michelle,
         the Green Mile.
           [all laugh]
     - For to come out here
   with her whole body green,
        I was just trying
      to figure out, what?
         Who in the hell
       left the gate open?
    You know what I'm saying?
    Like, what we gonna get?
    - It was a long way to go
      for a one-word joke.
  Michelle doesn't like green,
     so I painted my body--
       except for my feet.
           [all laugh]
     It just was misguided.
             -Yeah.
           -Confused.
   I actually drew a picture,
  look, on my notes, of a bomb.
       - Oh, my goodness.
          - But we know
       what Alexis can do
    because she has delivered
       in the<i> Snatch Game,</i>
         as Kris Jenner.
         - But she chose
    this position to go last.
       That's a big swing,
     and it was a big miss.
           - Silence.
     I've made my decision.
      Bring back my girls.
   [RuPaul laughs, bell rings]
         [RuPaul laughs]
     - Welcome back, ladies.
    I've made some decisions.
    Shea Coulee, you're safe.
          You may join
        the other girls.
          - Thank you.
         - Sasha Velour,
      you're smarty, arty,
          and tonight,
      you turned the party.
   Peppermint, we finally got
 a taste of the real Peppermint,
        and we loved it.
           Peppermint,
       con-drag-ulations.
        You're the winner
    of this week's challenge.
           [applause]
             - Aah!
    - You've won a five-year
  membership with Squarespace,
  which includes a consultation
     with their design team
      for your own personal
    website and online shop.
          - Thank you.
       - And Sasha Velour,
          you're safe.
         The two of you
    may join the other girls.
           [applause]
         Trinity Taylor,
       your barnyard humor
       did not make us go,
         hey, girl, hey.
         Farrah, tonight
        you made us moan,
           but for all
       the wrong reasons.
        Alexis Michelle,
       tonight you proved
   it's not easy being green,
   and comedy is even harder.
        Trinity Taylor...
          You're safe.
            - [sighs]
         - You may join
        the other girls.
     - [whispers] Thank you.
         - Farrah Moan,
        Alexis Michelle,
  I'm sorry, my dears, but you
     are up for elimination.
      - My heart is racing.
  Getting to<i> Drag Race</i> has been
   an eight-year-long journey,
 and feeling like this might be
     the end of that journey
         is devastating.
          - Two queens
        stand before me.
Ladies, this is your last chance
          to impress me
        and save yourself
        from elimination.
      The time has come...
            [thunder]
           to lip sync
    [echoing] for your life.
      - I just have to take
    a deep breath and focus,
       because this is it.
          - Good luck,
      and don't fuck it up.
          [music plays]
           [applause]
             - Whoo!
            - Ladies,
     I've made my decision.
        Alexis Michelle,
       shantay, you stay.
          You may join
        the other girls.
          - Thank you.
         - Farrah Moan,
    you're a beautiful queen
       with a big future.
       Shine on, showgirl.
        Now sashay away.
    - Thank you guys so much.
           [applause]
     I am so proud of myself
      for never letting go
          of my dream,
          but I've got
      a lot more to learn.
      It's been nice, L.A.,
        but now it's time
   for me to go cook in Vegas.
               Oh.
          - My queens,
       con-drag-ulations.
          And remember,
   if you can't love yourself,
         how in the hell
  you gonna love somebody else?
        Can I get an amen
           up in here?
             -Amen!
           -All right.
     Now let the music play.





         My name is Aja.
       I'm 22 years old.
   I had to think about that.
And I'm from Brooklyn, New York.
        [music playing]
       I got my drag name
    from a Bollywood movie.
       I don't know what
      it's called, but it
      had that little song
    that was like, (SINGING)
       Jamie, Jamie, Aja.
  And I was like, I like that.
     And I absolutely have
     no idea what it means.
         But I like it.
   I'm known for doing things
  that other people don't do.
    Not in terms of my drag,
     but just in terms of I
   will call everyone out and
    always speak the truth.
          That's good.
       I went to church.
      They always tell you
     God don't like liars.
And I will not lie to your face.
     So don't ask me if you
     look bad because I'll
     tell you you look bad.
    I'm just a crazy person.
 I'm crying now on the inside.
   I'm not really competitive
     at all, to be honest.
   I just really like to have
  fun and I'm kind of a joker
and I like to joke with people.
   And sometimes, at people.
So I hope nobody gets mad at me.
   My drag aesthetic is very
 much like slutty, anime girl,
   but also kind of ratchet.
 She's from Brooklyn so she has
  to uphold that hood status.
        My look is very
      Judy Jetson hooker.
   And I'm just very inspired
 by Gautier meets Mugler meets
  furry monsters, but pastel.
      Season 9 is going to
     be, I don't even know.
    These bitches are crazy.
   My name is Alexis Michelle.
I am 33 years old and I was born
  and raised in New York City.
   When I'm not dressed like
this, my name is Alex Michaels.
    So I decided to feminize
      my name since Alexis
   is really my female half.
    Alexis Michelle is known
     for her theatricality,
     her lip sync talents,
        her live vocals,
   and being pretty thirsty.
 I am a fierce competitor, but
  I also know that my biggest
     competition is myself.
       So I don't need to
       tear anybody down.
   I can lend you something.
      I can help you out.
   And still be able to beat
     you, like a good girl.
     I'm a good girl, I am.
         I am all about
      body, curve, swerve,
    glamour, class, a little
      touch of prostitute,
    and of course, this mug.
 When I decided to go with this
  bright vibrant neon yellow,
       I said, I want to
        feel structure.
    I want to feel my shape.
    Alexis is known for her
  cinched waist and her hips.
     So I wanted to really
        bring that out,
     but elevate it to more
       of a high fashion,
  almost McQueen-esque place.
 I can sit down at that makeup
   table and think, oh, god,
here we go again, another face.
  And then something happens.
     As the shapes start to
   come out, as the contours
     pop, as the lashes go
     on, as I pout my lips.
      Something comes over
    me and all of a sudden,
      Alexis has arrived.
     Hi, I'm Charlie Hides.
  I'm from Boston and London,
  and I'm [coughs] years old.
         I'm bicoastal.
   I'm a transatlantic dame.
  My side hustle is I'm a butt
   double for Britney Spears.
  How did I get my drag name?
 It's the name on my passport.
         So inventive.
           Creative.
Pushed the boat out on that one.
   I'm known for, apparently,
        being the oldest
   drag race contestant ever.
Why did I audition for the show?
      Because I'm so old.
    If I don't do it now, by
  next year, I could be dead.
 I'm so old, my ears are still
   ringing from the Big Bang.
     What I do to transform
    is I take lots of makeup
       and I throw it up
     into the ceiling fan.
       I get under it and
       hope for the best.
         My drag look?
       Eclectic, lots of
       different things.
       It's high fashion.
      I'm a crafty queen.
     What inspired my look
     today was Julie Newmar
      meets Philip Treacy.
   An inspiration for me is,
  if I wake up in the morning,
  I think this is a good day.
   Let's make the most of it.
        Let's have fun.
        Let's look good.
 Let's make a few people laugh.
     And if I can get paid
    for it, all the better.
       I want to be known
         for the person
 that when someone was feeling
    bad or had a rough day,
  they saw one of my shows and
   it made them feel better.
     I'm a team player, so
      I work with my team.
And when it's my time to shine,
   I sparkle, Neely, sparkle.
    Season 9 is going to be
     the best season ever.
     You heard it from me.
      Don't quote me, but
        I'm pretty sure.
       My name is Eureka.
      I come from Johnson
        City, Tennessee.
     I am 25 years old and
    I am big, ready to jig,
   and ready to win this gig.
  I actually got my drag name,
  my mother's name is Eureka,
but it's spelt the German form.
 She's from Germany and I just
  looked at my vacuum cleaner
    and was like, Americans,
     will be able to spell
   that out and sound it out.
      So I became Eureka.
     Eureka's really known
       in her profession
 as someone who is high energy,
  very smiley, very positive,
  but also is a dancing queen.
       I like to push the
    boundaries and the molds
        that the bigger
   community has been given.
   I like to wear things that
  we're not supposed to wear.
 I like to have the shape that
  we're not supposed to have.
    And I like to dance hard
    and do things that they
 don't expect a big girl to do.
    She's just big and loud
      and crazy, but fun.
She's going to entertain you on
 and off the stage, regardless.
        It's who she is.
      I'm a perfectionist,
         so everything
has to be perfect at all times,
   especially aesthetically.
  And it can cause me to be a
  little introverted at times,
 and sometimes a little snippy.
     So the bitches better
      watch out, because I
 might cuss, cut, or eat them.
       If I was going to
     describe my aesthetic,
  I would say the Kool-Aid man
  meets Eureka's castle meets
  Hobby Lobby meets the Grand
    Duchess meets Mary Queen
  of Scots meets fabulousness.
    Today, I am inspired by
     fire and the color red
      because it dedicates
    my passion and my drive
   and the flame that I have
  under my ass for a fat girl
      to finally win this
      [beep] competition.
     My name is Farrah Moan.
       I'm 23 years old.
    Born and raised in Texas
  and now living in Las Vegas.
 My drag name Farrah comes from
 my '70s idol, Farrah Fawcett.
      And Moan comes from,
    well, me being a whore.
  When it comes to competing,
   I am not that competitive.
    I mostly just make sure
    that whatever I'm doing
   is true to what I like and
    what I want to showcase.
     I'm definitely not one
      of those girls that
       compares myself to
     other people or wants
   to be better than anyone.
     I just want to be the
      best me that I can.
       My drag aesthetic
        is on a spectrum
  between fetish and showgirl.
     I think I get a lot of
     my fetishy inspiration
        just from my own
     fantasies and desires.
     And then my old school
  Vegas showgirl feel is just
     from being so inspired
    by feathers and sparkles
  and rhinestones and glamour.
  And just that whole iconic,
  larger than life silhouette.
        My look today is
   inspired by old Hollywood
  meets retro glam, mixed with
  a little bit of the fetishy
    aspect of my aesthetic.
      Season 9 is going to
     be absolutely insane.
         Hi, my name is
       Jaymes Mansfield.
    I'm 26 years old and I'm
   from the Antarctic prison
 known as Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
     [squeals] My drag name
    comes from my birth name
      being James and the
    actress Jayne Mansfield.
   I think I'm best known for
   my YouTube channel, Jaymes
    Mansfield, where I talk
      about hair styling,
        makeup, and even
      drag queen history,
   like I'm making right now.
    I'm a drag foster child.
        I have two drag
     mothers, the first one
      a legendary pageant
      queen of Milwaukee,
   Wisconsin, Rudy D'angelo.
 And the third one, a legendary
 trash queen of West Hollywood,
    the Amazing Ruby Claire.
       My side hustle is
   hairstyling, babysitting,
     and selling cookies at
     the church bake sale.
     I am very competitive.
  I don't take things lightly.
      I will hurt people.
     But I think I'm going
     to play nice this time
  and give the girls a little
    bit before I, you know,
     slash their eyes out.
     I transfer into Jaymes
  Mansfield in one simple way.
 I stand still and spin myself
 around in a circle like Wonder
  Woman and, poof, I'm there.
 My entire look is inspired by
  small children, big dreams,
        and I'd say, my
    puppetry and creativity.
        I'm walking art.
       But not vivacious.
          I'm pretty.
  My outfit was created by my
   wonderful, long suffering
       maid, Mr. Jaymes.
       He stayed up many
      long nights creating
 this look last minute for me,
  and I appreciate him for it.
      My look is inspired
       by, well, I wanted
   to be big in the shoulders
 without having to gain weight.
         So, [squeals].
 Season 9 is going to be mine.
     My name is Kimora Blac.
      I'm 28 and I'm from
      Sin City, Las Vegas.
   I picked Kimora because I
    love Kimora Lee Simmons,
   but she's irrelevant now.
    So obviously, there has
     to be someone younger.
         And that's me.
   But Kimora, no one has it.
    It can't be duplicated.
    Kimora just sounds hot.
   When you hear Kimora, it's
   like, damn, who's Kimora?
      I am your life size
       Barbie, you know?
  Like out of the Barbie box.
   Like I am your rich, hot,
    platinum blonde Barbie.
       Super bronzy, like
     straight guys love me.
       Gay guys love me.
      Drag queens love me.
     I'm a really hot guy.
         Like, I would
      totally date myself.
     Like, this full blown,
  like, beard and, like, hot.
        But then, when I
        get into Kimora,
    it's such a long process
   because I am so perfected.
   Because I cannot go out of
 the house looking like busted.
     And some of the queens
    are kind of like busted.
      So that is like the
    top of my list is like,
   one, you cannot be busted.
      My drag aesthetic is
    just sexy and show girl.
       I've come from the
       city of showgirls.
   My look today was actually
really inspired by this fashion
     designer Marco Marco.
       I love his stuff.
   It's not Marco Marco, but
   it's just inspired by him.
 I had to tint my hair hot pink
 because I bleached it too much
       and the split ends
     were kind of showing.
      So I had to kind of
      go in so real girls
  don't get too jealous of me.
              Hey.
 Well, I am Nina Bo'Nina Banana
Fofana Osama on season 9 Brown.
        And honey, I am
      from South Carolina,
       but I do reside in
      Riverdale, Georgia.
       My first drag name
      was Beata Bitchass.
And then it was Lady Guinevere,
but people couldn't spell that.
       They would call me
        Lady Guinea Pig.
       I was sleeping one
    night and I had a dream.
     And somehow, the word
   Nina was just in my dream.
        I would use that
     name, go to the club.
      Somebody would say,
    come out, Nina Bo'Nina.
       And I'm like, OK.
     If 2 plus 2 equals 4,
    that makes sense to me.
    So that was Nina Bo'Nina
       and I said Brown.
        My aesthetic is
       hard to describe.
   Like really, I don't know
    how to describe myself.
  I don't know where I belong.
       I don't want to be
       in a box, either.
        And I feel like
       I'm a black queen
      who does things that
     a lot of black queens
      haven't really done.
  Even a lot of white queens.
      I can give you glam.
      I can give you sexy.
     I can give you crazy.
  I can give you a character.
    It's whatever I choose.
    I just don't want to be,
    like, a one-note queen.
     What inspired today's
    look was grape Kool-Aid.
         No, seriously.
      What does-- a video
        game, actually.
         A video game.
        I'm a big video
      player, I'm a nerd.
           I'm a guy.
    So anybody out there who
 plays some PlayStation, honey,
          bring it on.
      And in the game, you
       get to make your--
   build your own characters.
   And there was this badass
      purple alien bitch.
  And I was like, cheekbones,
     lips, eyes, that's me.
Kiddies, tune in because season
  9 is going to be surprising
    and you are not going to
   know what to expect, baby.
         So get ready.
           My name is
     Peppermint and I'm 37
 years old from New York City.
  I got my drag name because I
  was sitting in a parking lot
        with this guy I
    totally had a crush on.
  And I was eating my favorite
candies, which are peppermints.
       And he just said,
      you know, you should
   call yourself Peppermint.
   I honestly would have done
anything he said, and so I did.
     Peppermint's my name.
           It stuck.
        I've been doing
       drag for so long.
 And I have done lots in drag.
    I've done lots of shows.
   I've done lots of people.
       I've done it all.
      And I really wanted
    something new, something
    that challenged myself.
And I think this is the perfect,
   perfect place to do that.
    My aesthetic is classy,
      chic, uptown flair,
   very urban, with a little
   bit of sex pot thrown in.
        Today's look, my
        hair is inspired
   by RuPaul herself from her
 "Ho, Ho, Ho" Christmas album.
       I think this is ho
     number two, this hair.
    And I just wanted to do
 something fabulous and flowy.
  And I'm giving a little bit
  of Endora from "Bewitched."
       I want to be known
       for the confidence
        that I have with
        my drag being as
  equal to the confidence that
  I bring to my everyday life
   as a trans woman and win.
 The first transgender winner.
       That sounds great.
    Season 9 is going to be
     epic because I'm here.
         I'm a legend.
        I'm fierce, I'm
    fabulous, and I'm ready.
    My name is Sasha Velour.
     I'm 29 years old and I
  live in Brooklyn, New York.
       My drag name is my
      actual name, Sasha.
       That was the name
        I was born with.
       And my whole life,
    I've had people tell me
    that it's a girl's name.
   So the logical conclusion
   is just to become a girl.
       Velour is a cheap
       imitation fabric.
   It's more useful and more
    affordable than velvet.
      So I think it's the
   perfect metaphor for drag.
   I'm an intense competitor.
         I love to win.
        I love to take a
    challenge and transform
   it to really work for me.
      And I'm excited for
       this competition.
      To transform into my
     fabulous drag persona
     is about the physical
   ritual of painting my face
   and costuming my body and
    shaving off all the hair
 and strapping everything down.
       That ritual really
     does help me transform
into this fabulous being that's
so much more than just my body.
       It's my ideas and
        my imagination.
  I think that drag is the art
 form of the queer imagination.
    So it's all about beauty
    that goes beyond gender.
   It's about experimentation
          and remixing
    and combining different
elements from different places.
  So it's just a hodgepodge of
  different fabulous and queer
      things that I love.
        Today's look is,
     like, '60s meets '20s.
         It's a bit of
      Philip Treacy, it's
 a bit of crazy, bald club kid.
      And it's my absolute
 favorite colors, red and pink
   and everything in between.
       Season 9 is going
      to be revolutionary.
    Hi, my name is Shea, Miss
    Coulee if you're nasty.
     I'm 27 years young and
    I'm from the Windy City.
     I got Shea because my
      middle name is Shea
       and in Swahili, it
      means beautiful boy.
       And I thought that
      that was appropriate
     and so I picked Coulee
   because I wanted to sound
   like a French supermodel.
  I'm gorgeous, I'm talented,
    I can sew, I can dance,
     I can act, I can sing.
       I can put my legs
        behind my head.
      I can speak French.
       You know, the list
        goes on and on.
     I'm known for being a
    really strong performer.
  I'm known for having a very
    editorial image online.
        I love fashion.
        I love clothing.
        I love modeling.
      And yeah, girl, I'm
    just sickening the house
    down, boots, Gaga, yes.
     My aesthetic is equal
    parts bougie and bangi.
      I woke up like this.
       So I mean, I just
  literally rolled out of bed
  and then walked my beautiful
   little black ass over here
     and sat in this chair.
         What is drag?
     I just wanted to give
      you African goddess
   realness, Queen Nefertiti.
Yeah, I just wanted to give you
  a really good visual of what
    a true queen looks like.
         Up until this
     competition, I always
 downplayed myself in order to
  make people feel comfortable
      and less threatened.
But now that I'm here, frankly,
 my dear, I don't give a damn.
So these girls better watch out.
       Season 9 is going
      to be unforgettable.
     Hi, I'm Trinity Taylor.
       I'm 31 years old.
      I'm originally from
      Birmingham, Alabama.
       And now, I reside
      in Orlando, Florida.
     I really liked Trinity
       from "The Matrix."
        She was a bitch.
 She had a strong personality.
       She a strong look.
     And at the time, I was
    like, I want to be her.
    And so I would wear jet
 black hair with no hair line,
         just horrible.
      Looked like a brick.
But that's who I thought I was.
             Yeah.
     I come from pageants,
    so I'm very competitive.
      I came here to win.
So that's what I'm going to do.
       I'm going to claw
       my way to the top.
 Putting makeup on other people
  other than myself for my day
     job is kind of boring
  because it's all like, nude,
     beige, and more nude.
     You know, I like this.
 I like the glam, the glitter,
    rhinestones, big lashes.
  They don't let you do that.
    My aesthetic is fierce.
        I love fashion.
          I love body.
         I love beauty.
          I love hair.
         I love makeup.
 I love to be a transformation.
 I was inspired for this look,
just this is my favorite color.
         I love blues.
  I love teals and turquoise.
 And I was thinking, I want to
be a ferocious futuristic bitch.
I want to be known for the fact
  that I'm very well-rounded.
     That I can sew, that I
   can do my makeup and hair,
       and still be nice
      to these other girls
       and help them out
      and still slay them.
     Because I'm that good.
  Hello, my name is Valentina.
         I live in Los
      Angeles, California,
     and I'm a little girl.
    My drag name came about
   it, it just like, snapped.
         It came to me.
  It sounded like a character
 out of a Pedro Almodovar film.
      It sounded like the
 protagonist from a telenovela.
       There's actually a
    salsa called Valentina.
   And also, I love Valentino
  and the color Valentino red.
    So I felt like Valentina
     was the perfect name.
 I'm glamorous, I'm Latina, I'm
 tall, I'm skinny, and luxury.
         I love luxury.
  And I'm a perfectionist and
    I strive for perfection.
         It's something
       that's impossible,
but why not shoot for the stars?
       Getting into drag,
        I have a ritual.
 Getting in drag, the process,
     it's my favorite part.
    So I turn on my candles,
       I put on my music.
      I sip on a glass of
     wine and I just paint.
        And I enjoy it.
      And I take a really
    long time getting ready.
      I love to luxuriate
         in the moment
     and really get excited
   when it comes time to put
   my blush or my lip gloss.
        And now lashes.
      And girl, put those
     contacts on and, boom,
  the transformation is ready.
      I love to get ready.
 It's my favorite part of drag.
        Today's look is
      referencing Prada's
last season, the spring/summer.
   I wanted to do a neoprene
  and I wanted the color to be
  mint and a [inaudible] coat.
  I'm really going for, like,
   this fantasy of just kind
 of doing a modern take on '60s
 glamour with the spiky lashes
      and the teased hair.
          Get into it.
 Season 9 is going to be drama.
