The Simpsons D'oh! Ick, my mouth tastes like an ashtray.
Smithers, wait your turn.
There's plenty of hot water for all.
Sir, you weren't shot.
It was all a dream.
That's right.
The year is 1965.
And you and I are undercover detectives on the hot-rod circuit.
Now let's burn rubber, baby! Speedway Squad! In color.
Wait.
That was all a dream.
Aw! Hey, then maybe I haven't become a hideous, drunken wreck.
And- Oh Dozens of people are gunned down each day in Springfield but until now none of them was important.
I'm Kent Brockman.
At 3:00 p.
m.
Friday, local autocrat C.
Montgomery Burns was shot, following a tense confrontation at town hall.
Burns was rushed to a nearby hospital, where he was pronounced dead.
He was then transferred to a better hospital, where doctors upgraded his condition to alive.
Now let's talk to Police Chief Wiggum.
Oh.
Oh, hiya, Ken.
Uh, right now we are questioning two witnesses who were in the vicinity at the time.
Did you see this guy? Was he anywhere near the parking lot when Burns got shot? Oh, it's no use.
They ain't talkin'.
Everyone in Springfield had a reason to shoot Mr.
Burns.
Even us.
Bart, he broke your dog's legs.
Grampa, he destroyed your home.
And, Dad, well, you kinda went berserk when he couldn't remember your name.
Berserk is right! May I have some iced tea, please? Aren't we forgetting someone, sister suspect? Yeah, I was just getting to me.
Because of Mr.
Burns, they canceled my jazz program and my friend Tito Puente got fired.
- But I could never shoot someone.
- Could so.
- Could not.
Could not.
- Could so.
Could so.
Kids, kids, kids.
As far as Daddy's concerned, you're both potential murderers.
The police already have a suspect.
It's Mr.
Smithers.
Oh, I bet he's the one.
Yeah, Smingers did it.
Case closed.
Now, where's my hat? I'm going to the outhouse.
- We don't have an outhouse.
- My toolshed! Oh, Dad! Oh! Could I have shot Mr.
Burns in a drunken rage? No, no, not me.
I know in my heart I- A gun.
And it's been recently fired.
Wait.
I remember leaving the town meeting.
I must have run into Mr.
Burns outside and- Hey! Mr.
Burns.
What have I done? Hey, Homer, us hotheads here is gonna go tear down Burns's sun-blockin' machine.
- You wanna come with? - Sure.
I've had it up to here with these damn rickets.
Pull, Duchess, pull! Um, uh, what town did we just crush? Shelbyville.
Oh, this guilt is driving me mad.
I've got to tell someone.
Father, I'm not a Catholic, but- Well, I tried to march in the St.
Patrick's Day parade.
Anyway, I've got a rather large sin to confess.
I'm the one who- who shot Mr.
Burns.
- That's all I needed to hear.
Boy, this thing works great.
The man became consumed by greed.
He'd steal from anyone.
This isn't a rival company you're battling with.
It's a school.
- People won't stand for it.
- Pish-posh.
It will be like taking candy from a baby.
Say, that sounds like a "larf.
" And when he tried to steal our sunlight he crossed that line between everyday villainy and cartoonish super-villainy.
Bah! He was a rank amateur compared to Dr.
Colossus.
Ow! Oh! When is my lawyer coming? Uh, Dave Shutton, Springfield Daily Shopper.
Who are you? Where you going? Oh, do your research, Shutton.
Uh, Kent Brockman, Channel Six News.
How does it feel to be accused of the attempted murder of your boss and mentor? Kent, I- I feel about as low as Madonna when she found out she missed Tailhook.
I'm gonna say ouch for Madonna.
Hey, that's my Madonna gag.
That guy stole my gag.
And you stole it from last Friday's episode of Pardon My Zinger.
Stole, made up-what's the difference? Mr.
Smithers must have seen that program too.
He never misses it.
Hmm.
At the town meeting, he mentioned that he watched Comedy Central.
I made sure to note that, as it seemed quite unusual.
Ye gods! To the police station, Krusty! I am Melvin Van Horn, and this is my associate, Hershel Krustofski.
- Hey, hey.
- Officers, you have arrested an innocent man.
Really? Oh, geez.
All right, Colossus, you're free to go.
- But stay away from Death Mountain.
- But all my stuff is there.
I was referring to Waylon Smithers.
Mr.
Burns was shot Friday at 3:00 p.
m the very time that Smithers was at home watching Pardon My Zinger.
So, you see, he couldn't have done it.
Yes, you're right.
I remember now.
I- I watched that entire show.
In fact, I left the town meeting early so I could get home in time.
Oh, I gotta run, or I'll miss the opening rank-out.
You better get out of my way, please.
Slow down.
The sidewalk's for regular walkin', not for fancy walkin'.
Get outta my way.
I'm in a hurry.
You simmer down, I'll let you go.
So, instead of wounding an evil old man I may have killed an innocent old man.
That's much worse.
About 50,000 volts worse, if you know what I mean.
Sizzle! Wait a minute.
If a second old geezer got shot, how come nobody reported it? Uh, hi.
Um, could we take a look at your leg? Yeah, it's real spruce.
You like it? Thank God.
Sir, I- I only hope you can forgive me for shooting your wooden leg.
You shot who in the what now? Okay, Smithers, you're free to go.
And, you, one question.
Do you know who shot Mr.
Burns? 'Cause we are really up the creek on this one.
And with the prime suspect cleared and found completely innocent we must now ask ourselves: Who could be as bloodthirsty as Waylon Smithers? I guess it's never the most likely suspect.
Actually, Mom, in 95% of cases, it is.
The rest of the time it's usually some deranged lunatic who did it for no reason.
Hey, I had a damn good reason.
He could never remember my name.
Who the devil are you? It's Homer Simpson! My name is Homer Simpson! Well, I don't think anyone in this family is capable of attempted murder.
Uh-uh-uh.
You never know what you're capable of.
I never thought I could shoot down a German plane but last year I proved myself wrong.
Nancy Drew says that all you need to solve a mystery is an inquisitive temperament and two good friends.
And I've got an inquisitive temperament.
Maybe I could help solve this.
I think you're a little young to be investigating an attempted murder.
Why don't you try to solve the mystery of who put that mud in the freezer? - Who wants chocolate ice cream? - Me! Me! Me, me! Okay, boys, we've got a clue- the bullet they took out of Burns.
Now, let's discuss the, um, "mo-tive.
" Mr.
Burns is the richest man in town.
Maybe it's about money.
- That's some good thinking, Lou.
- Oh, thanks, Chief.
Hey, I said that.
My name is Lisa Simpson.
And I made a chart of all the suspects in the Burns case.
Look.
Mr.
Burns hurt all these people financially.
Nightclub owner, Moe Syzslak.
His bar was closed because of Burns's negligence.
Liquor connoisseur, Barney Gumble.
When Moe's closed, Barney lost his only means of support- sucking coins out of the love tester machine.
That's a real good way to get sick.
Dedicated educator Principal Seymour Skinner.
His school lost millions when Burns pirated its oil well.
And grounds tender, Groundskeeper Willie, he lost his job and his dream of owning a fine crystal slop bucket.
Hey, what about that jazz teacher that got laid off? You know, uh, Mr.
Samba, Senor Mambo.
What was it? - Tito Puente? - Yeah.
Well, he did vow revenge.
But I can't see him doing something illegal.
- He's in show business.
He's a celebrity.
- Let's roll, boys.
Revenge? Of course.
But why wound his body with bullets when I could set his soul afire with a slanderous mambo? Listen, if you will, to my revenge.
Uno, dos, tres.
Wounds won't last long But an insulting song Burns will always carry with him So I settle my score on the salsa floor With this vengeful Latin rhythm Burns Con el corazÃ³n de perro Senor Burns El diablo con dinero It may not surprise you But all of us despise you Please die And fry in hell You rotten Rich old wretch Adios viejo - Oh, olÃ©.
- Yeah! Okay, okay, I believe you're innocent.
Gee, I hope all of the suspects are this much fun.
Hmm.
Now- Now let- Let me- Let me think.
Now I did- I did go to the town meeting with the intention of ambushing Mr.
Burns.
When it adjourned, I rushed to the lavatory to apply my camouflage makeup.
Blast! I took mother's makeup kit by mistake.
Oh, uh, excuse me, ma'am.
Superintendent Chalmers.
Oh, my God.
So, Superintendent Chalmers can vouch for your whereabouts? Oh, yes.
But anything else he tells you is a filthy lie.
I'm telling you, I could nay have shot Burns.
This is your last warning about that.
It's impossible for me to fire a pistol.
If you'll check my medical records you'll see I have a crippling arthritis in me index fingers.
Look at 'em! Oh, I got it from Space Invaders in 1977.
- Oh, yeah, that was a pretty addictive video game.
- Video game? - Do you hold a grudge against Montgomery Burns? - No.
All right, maybe I did, but I didn't shoot him.
Checks out.
Okay, sir, you're free to go.
Good, 'cause I got a hot date tonight.
A date.
Dinner with friends.
Dinner alone.
Watching TV alone.
All right! I'm gonna sit at home and ogle the ladies in the Victoria Secret Catalog.
Sears Catalog.
Now would you unhook this already, please? I don't deserve this kind of shabby treatment.
Grampa, I found your cigar box dug up in the backyard, but the gun wasn't there.
- Have you seen it? - You accuse me of everything around here.
"Who put slippers in the dishwasher?" "Who threw a cane at the TV?" "Who fell into the china hutch?" I was just asking if you'd seen it.
There's no need to be a prickly pear.
Oh, you're the bee's knees, baby.
I missed you bad.
Were you talking to me, Grampa? - Um, yes.
- Eww! We're still not close.
Boy, this is gonna be an all-night brain-buster.
Well, better drink some coffee.
We're out of coffee.
Well, I'll just drink this warm cream.
Huh? I'm not following you.
Huh? Look at Burns's suit! Yeesh! - What? Oh! Oh.
- I had an idea, Chief.
Why don't we check out that suit Burns was wearing when he got shot? Did you have the same backwards-talking dream with the flaming cards? I'll drive.
Eureka! - Ooh, nice eyelash.
Yours? - No.
We need to find out who it belonged to.
We want a D.
N.
A.
test.
Ooh, ooh, hey, ooh, oh.
That takes eight to 10 weeks.
Did I say weeks? 'Cause I meant seconds.
What do you got, the whole town's D.
N.
A.
on file? Yuh-huh.
If you've ever handled a penny, the government's got your D.
N.
A.
Why do you think they keep them in circulation? The scan's finished.
Now it's gonna narrow it down to the family bloodline.
- Homer Simpson! - Bingo.
- The gunman has a name-o.
- Chief! Chief! Hey, Chief Wiggum, what are you doing? What's going on? I'm sorry, kid.
We got Simpson D.
N.
A.
on Burns's clothing and your father was identified by the old man himself.
D.
N.
A.
Positive I.
D.
D.
N.
A.
Positive I.
D.
- Those won't hold up in any court.
Run, Dad! - Hey, ho! Look what I found under Mr.
Simpson's car seat.
I swear, I've never seen that gun before.
They why are your fingerprints all over it, sir? This bullet matches the one we took out of Burns.
Homer Simpson, you're under arrest for attempted murder.
- D'oh! - Yeah, that's what they all say.
They all say, "D'oh.
" Yeah, we need two cups of coffee and two orders of bite-sized breakfast pancakes, with extra dipping sauce.
Please pull up to the service window, please.
The wagon's too tall.
Oh, I don't wanna have to get out.
I'll just drive up on the curb.
Blughh.
- Almost got it.
- Drop the food, Chief! Dang fools.
Drive-through's not for a-parkin'.
Diane, I'm going to take my break now.
Hi, everybody! Ho mer Simp son.
Okay, that was a little strange.
Um, tell me, how you feeling today? Homer Simpson.
Homer.
D'oh, Simpson.
Hmm, that seems to be all you can say.
When you were in that coma, did you feel your brain getting damaged? The police have such a strong case against Homer.
Mr.
Burns said he did it.
They have Homer's D.
N.
A.
They have Simpson D.
N.
A.
It could have come from any of us.
Except you, since you're a Bouvier.
No, no, no, when I took your father's name I took everything that came with it, including D.
N.
A.
Okay, Mom.
Anyway, my point is the evidence isn't as concrete as it seems.
Like those fingerprints.
They could have gotten on the gun some other way.
Are you sure you don't want me to hold one of your ice-cream cones? Yeah, right.
You chose fruit.
You live with fruit.
D'oh! You- Oh! No.
No.
No.
Eww! Why is this on the floor? And we don't even know whose gun that was.
Maybe somebody planted it there to frame Dad.
No.
We can't start thinking that way about our own family members.
Suspicion could tear us apart.
That's right.
We all gotta stick together if we're gonna have any hope of bringing that awful Homer to justice.
Here is a photo of the fugitive from our files.
And now Waylon Smithers, who's been a real good sport about that wrongful arrest thing- has a statement that he would like to make.
- Waylon.
- Thank you.
As Montgomery Burns's closest friend, I'm certain there is nothing he would want more than swift, brutal revenge against Homer Simpson.
Therefore, I am offering a $50,000 reward for his capture.
- Dead or alive.
- Holy cow! Me first! Me first! Homer Simpson? So, you finally learned my name, eh? Homer Simpson.
I've got no time for your demented parlor games.
You won't be telling anyone else that Homer Simpson shot you.
The scene of the crime.
There must be something here that can clear Dad.
- Clue.
Clue.
- That's it.
Oh, Mr.
Pigeon, I'd kiss you if you weren't swimming with disease.
So, the D.
N.
A.
was right.
- It must have been- Oh, Dad! - Attention, all units.
Homer Simpson has been sighted.
Proceed at once to Marvin Monroe Memorial Hospital.
Be careful when we capture him.
We cannot claim the reward unless we have 51% of the carcass.
Stop! Don't shoot my dad! He's innocent.
He wouldn't hurt a fly.
- Homer Simpson.
- Stop telling them it was me! - I'll kill you for saying it was me! - Homer Simpson.
What is the meaning of this? Smithers, who is this beast that's shaking me? D'oh! Say it, Burns! Say I never shot you before.
Shot? By you? I'm afraid not, my primitive friend.
Your kind has neither the cranial capacity nor the opposable digits to operate a firearm.
The one who shot me was- M-Maggie Simpson! With the sun-blocker in place and the town aghast, I was on top of the world.
So, I wanted to kick up my heels and indulge my sweet tooth.
I feel like celebrating.
Oh, it's you.
What are you so happy about? I see.
Yes.
That's the one.
Smithers had thwarted my earlier attempt to take candy from a baby.
But with him out of the picture, I was free to wallow in my own crapulence.
I think you'd better drop it.
But the old axiom was misleading.
Taking the candy proved exceedingly difficult.
I said drop it! Stricken, I lurched forth in search of aid.
But finding only slack-jawed gawkers I gave up and collapsed on the sundial.
Then with your last ounce of strength you pointed to "W" and "S.
" Or, from your point of view, "M" and "S.
" - Maggie Simpson.
- What? No! With my last ounce of strength, I sucked out my gold fillings and swallowed them.
Those paramedics have sticky fingers.
Well, I'm just relieved that Homer's safe and that you've recovered and we can all get back to normal.
If Maggie could talk, I'm sure she'd apologize for shooting you.
I'm afraid that's insufficient.
Officer, arrest the baby.
Yeah, right, Pops.
No jury in the world's gonna convict a baby.
Hmm, maybe Texas.
Besides, she didn't mean it.
It was an accident.
Shh!

The Simpsons D'oh! Oh, all these new superheroes suck.
None of them could hold a candle to Radioactive Man.
The only decent new one is Radiation Dude.
- He's a cheap imitation of Radioactive Man.
- Explain.
The similarities are subtle, but many.
For example, Radioactive Man has his famous catchphrase, "Up and Atom!" With "at 'em" spelled A-T-O-M, in a delicious pun.
- Go on.
- While Radiation Dude has a similar but lamer catchphrase, "Up and let's go!" So you kids fancy yourselves experts, eh? Well, between us we've read all 814 issues of Radioactive Man.
Yeah, and we both have a special, limited-edition issue where he and Fallout Boy get killed on every page.
I suppose you know then, that Hollywood is planning a feature film about Radioactive Man.
I have got to do something about that air conditioner suction.
Who's gonna play Radioactive Man? I will tell you in exactly seven minutes.
Okay.
Here we are.
Alt dot nerd dot obsessive.
Need know star R.
M.
pic.
Yeah, I don't see why Rainier Wolfcastle should be the star.
I think we should bring back Dirk Richter.
Kids will want to see the original Radioactive Man.
I keep telling you, he's 73 years old and he's dead.
- Granted, but- - Besides, we want to stay as far away from the campy '70s version as possible.
Billowing backpacks, Radioactive Man! It's the worst villain of them all! The Scoutmaster! - I see him, Fallout Boy.
- Go get 'em, Scouts.
Don't be afraid to use your nails, boys! So, where can we shoot this picture? We need a city that has a nuclear reactor and a gorge and can guarantee us the full cooperation of city officials.
I'll check Variety.
Wow.
Look at that ad.
All right, this place must be hot.
They don't need a big ad - or even correct spelling.
- I agree with that logic.
Get me two plane tickets to the state that Springfield is in.
Right.
We have $30 million to spend.
We'll blow up our dams, destroy forests- anything! If there's a species of animal that's causing you problems nosing around your camera, we'll have it wiped out! Look, we just want to make movies, not kill things.
Right.
We understand.
Students, I have an announcement.
One of your favorite comic book heroes, "Radio Man"- Radioactive Man, stupid! Strange.
I shouldn't have been able to hear that.
Anyway, a Hollywood studio has decided to film the Radioactive Man movie here in Springfield.
And, they will be holding auditions to find a local youngster to play Fallout Boy.
Oh, and the air conditioner will be fixed this afternoon.
Look behind you, Radioactive Man! The sun is exploding again! Bart, why are you talking like that? Yeah, and who the hell are you talkin' to? Marge, do you have other men in this house? Radioactive men? I'm practicing my Fallout Boy dialogue.
If I get his role, I could finally come to terms with this funny little muddle called Bart.
Ev-er-y-one is talk-ing a-bout Ra-di-o-ac-tive M-an y'all.
Wow! You mean, you were one of the original Little Rascals? - Yeah.
- Which one were you? The ugly one? - Were you the ugly one? - No, I was the tough kid.
Smelly.
My shtick was lookin' into an exhaust pipe and gettin' a face full of soot.
Nobody could do that better than me.
Of course, it was kinda hard to think of reasons for me to look in that exhaust pipe every time but, you know, we had good writers.
William Faulkner can write an exhaust pipe gag that would really make you think.
If you were such a big shot, why aren't you still makin' movies? Moe? Moe! - Oh, no! My favorite aggie! - Oh! Ha? Hmm? Oh.
You stole my bit! You-That's my bit, you- Oh, you stole my bit! Cut.
! Oh, my God.
! He's killed the original Alfalfa! Yeah.
Luckily, Alfalfa was an orphan, owned by the studio.
- Oh, I see.
- Yeah.
That makes sense.
With wealthy Hollywood people on the way local merchants can be forgiven for raising their prices a little.
Help me, Radioactive Man.
Watch out, Radioactive Man! - Totally awesome.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
It's all in the delivery.
"Now is the winter of our discontent"- Oh, no! Run! Cool! Yeah.
Mom! Don't make me do this! - I don't wanna be an actor.
- Nonsense.
You're going to be great.
Now take off those glasses, so they can see your beautiful eyes.
At last the world is safe, eh, Fallout Boy? - Watch out! - Next! Ha-ha! Hey, that hurts.
No wonder no one came to my birthday party.
At last the world is safe - eh, Fallout Boy? - What's for lunch tomorrow? - Next.
- Chicken necks? We're never going to find-Wait a minute.
That child has the exact qualities we're looking for.
! He's perfect.
! What is his name? I don't know.
He just came along with one of the others.
- He didn't sign up officially.
- Oh, forget him then.
It wouldn't be fair to the other children who filled out their application forms in full.
Next! At last the world is safe, eh, Fallout Boy? Watch out, Radioactive Man! - Brilliant reading.
Again? - Watch out, Radioactive Man! Fantastic! One more time! - Watch out, Radioactive Man! - Congratulations, Bart Simpson.
You're our new Fallout Boy.
! That's what I'd be saying to you if you weren't an inch too short.
Next! I've got to grow an inch by tomorrow, or I won't get that part.
Pull, you mighty stallions, pull! Show me no mercy! Oh! Oh, I only grew half an inch.
I'm still too short.
Growing half an inch in one day is still pretty good, Bart.
Yeah, that's how fast Grampa's shrinking.
Oh, I'm as tall as I ever was.
Is there any way I can look taller without actually being taller? Good news, gentlemen.
I've grown that extra inch you wanted.
- Plus several feet more.
- We found our new Fallout Boy! And he's right over there.
Huh? Ladies and gentlemen meet America's new Fallout Boy! Out of the way.
Milhouse, baby! Lionel Hutz, your new agent, bodyguard, unauthorized biographer and drug dealer- uh, keeper-awayer.
Leave me alone! Mom! Dad! Make 'em stop! - What is all this stuff? - Uh, we've heard you've become a star.
We decided we better start living in the fast lane.
What if I'm not a success? How will you pay for all this? I'm sorry.
I can't hear you, son.
I'm wearing a Jacuzzi suit.
I just missed out on the greatest opportunity of my entire life.
George Burns was right.
Show business is a hideous bitch goddess.
Cheer up, Bart.
Milhouse is still gonna need a true friend.
Someone to tell him he's great.
Someone to rub lotion on him.
Someone he can hurl whiskey bottles at when he's feeling low.
You're right, Lise.
I can suck up to him like the religious people suck up to God! Guess what, kids? They're gonna pay us $50 a day to film some of the movie here.
Ah, we'll run that cable through here.
Careful, now.
Hey.
Didn't you direct Unnatural Discretion? Well, yes, I did.
Hoo-whee! Whoo! Oh! You know, I never walk out of a movie, but, yuck! I've got an idea, Mr.
Simpson.
Why don't you get somethin' to eat from our food truck? - Hey.
! - M-Mr.
Simpson? You've gotta give me the part of Krispy the Clown! I'm sorry! You're wrong for the part.
But look at my range! I'm sorry.
Krispy the Clown has been cast.
But I will hire you for Angry the Clown, Silly Sailor and Dr.
Clownius.
I won't let you down! Well, I might let you down on Silly Sailor.
- Up and atom.
- Up and at them.
- Up and atom! - Up and at them! - Up and atom! - Up and at them! Better.
Hi, Milhouse! Hey, I want you to know that I'm glad at least one of us got the part.
Milhouse! I didn't do it.
I wished him well.
I wished him well! Stupid dummy wasn't supposed to explode yet.
There's the real Milhouse.
Milhouse! Hey, you're not Milhouse.
No, I'm just Milhouse when he gets hurt.
Ohh! Okay.
Let's get the real Milhouse over here, under the X-ray truck.
Hi, Bart.
Hey, cool, Milhouse.
You get to be crushed by a truck.
It sounds like more fun than it really is.
Hey! I- I think I'm lying on a broken bottle! Beautiful! Use it.
Okay.
Fallout Boy, origin scene, take one- Action.
! - Up and at them.
- Thanks for the help, mysterious stranger.
Say.
I think those X-rays gave me super powers.
And cut.
! That was perfect.
! Let's do it again.
Uh, these aren't real X-rays, are they? Good question! We'll check into that.
Okay.
X-ray machine to full power, and action! Uh, sir, why don't you just use real cows? Cows don't look like cows on film.
You gotta use horses.
What do you do if you want something that looks like a horse? Uh, usually we just tape a bunch of cats together.
- You guys work on the movie? - You're sayin' we're not working? Oh, I always wanted to be a Teamster.
So lazy and surly.
Mind if I relax next to ya? Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Oh, here he comes.
What is it now, Quimby? Nothing.
Nothing.
Only the, uh, city has just passed another tax on puffy directing pants.
But I don't wear puffy pants! I meant a, uh, tax on not wearing puffy pants.
- Oy! - I'm sorry.
Wow! You've really got it made now, Milhouse.
- This is living! - Is it, Bart? - Is it really? - Yeah.
Ever since I became a movie star, I've been miserable.
I had to get up at 5:00 a.
m.
just for makeup.
I like the way the blush brings out my cheekbones, but it's not worth it.
And making movies is so horribly repetitive.
I've said "jiminy jillickers" so many times, the words have lost all meaning.
We've got to do the jiminy jillickers scene again, Milhouse.
But we already did it.
It took seven hours, but we did it.
It's done.
Yes! But we've got to do it from different angles.
Again and again! And again and again and again! Yeah! Ach! I can't believe Silly Sailor beat us both up - and imprisoned us in his floating Aquaworld.
- Jiminy jillickers! There, now, there's no need for profanity, Fallout Boy.
Everyone in town has been gouging us silly, but it's worth it.
- It's all up there on the screen.
- Yes.
That Milhouse is going to be big.
! Gabby Hayes big! Okay, listen up, everybody.
This is the hardest most expensive scene in the movie, and we only get one shot at it.
So we have to do it right.
Fallout Boy will untie Radioactive Man and pull him to safety moments before he's hit with a 40-foot wall of sulfuric acid that will horribly burn everything in its path.
Now, that's real acid, so I want to see goggles, people.
- Real acid? - Okay.
Roll film! Tip the acid vats.
! And action.
Only Fallout Boy can save me now.
Where's Fallout Boy? - Fallout Boy! - Uh-oh.
My eyes.
The goggles do nothing.
Where in the hell is Milhouse? That one shot cost us a million dollars! Where's the producer? I want to talk about this coffee.
Milhouse! Thanks to modern editing techniques we can use existing footage to complete the film without Milhouse.
Watch.
Looks like we're in trouble, Fallout Boy.
Jiminy jillickers, Radioactive Man! We'll have to fight our way out.
Are you ready? Yes.
Seamless, huh? - You're fired.
- And with good cause! Go! Okay.
We can all stop worrying now.
These dogs never fail.
But will they just find Milhouse, or will they find him and kill him? Well, they'll- When they find him, they'll, um- Excuse me, you didn't answer me.
You just trailed off.
Yeah.
Yeah, I did kinda trail off there, didn't I? I know Milhouse.
I'll just check all his old haunts.
- Have you seen Milhouse? - No.
Now, go away.
We're racing for the title of the Champion of the Universe.
All right! - Yo! Doctor "S.
" Have you seen Milhouse today? - No.
- Okay.
Thanks.
- Wait.
Did you know that there's a direct correlation between the decline of Spirograph and the rise in gang activity? - Think about it.
- I will.
No, you won't.
The only place left is the tree house.
- Aha! - Stay away from me, Bart.
I mean it.
I'm not going back.
- I'm not cut out to be a star.
- But, Milhouse being a star is every patriotic American's dream.
Not mine.
It's a sham, Bart.
You get up on that movie screen pretending to be a hero, but you're not.
The real heroes are out there, toiling day and night on more important things.
- Television? - No! Curing heart disease and wiping out world hunger.
But, Milhouse, they haven't cured anything.
Heart disease and world hunger are still rampant.
Those do-gooders are all a bunch of pitiful losers.
Every last one of'em! Want results? You have to go to the Schwarzeneggers, the Stallones and to a lesser extent, the Van Dammes.
Mickey Rooney.
! Hi, Milhouse.
The studio sent me to talk to you being a former child star myself, and the number-one box office draw from 1939 through 1940! Wow! Spanning two decades.
- How'd you find us? - Uh, they tapped your tree house phone.
Milhouse.
Listen, you can't quit this movie.
I've seen your work.
It's good.
Very, very good.
- Van Johnson good.
- I know I'm good.
- Movie stardom is just so hollow.
- Hollow? The only thing in show business that's hollow is the music industry.
Come on, Milhouse.
You have to do this.
If not for yourself, then for the movie-going public and for the foreign markets that are more important than ever nowadays.
And finally, for me the Mickster.
- No! - All right.
I tried.
Fortunately, we have a perfectly good Fallout Boy right here.
Jiminy jillickers.
Jiminy jillickers.
Jiminy jillickers! - We're shutting down production.
- Yeah, well, we only have $1,000 left anyway.
Ah, there's a $1,000 "leaving town" tax.
I hope you're all satisfied.
You bankrupted a bunch of naive movie folks.
Folks from a Hollywood where values are different.
They weren't thinking about the money.
They just wanted to tell a story.
A story about a radioactive man and you slick small-towners took 'em for all they were worth.
Should we give them some of their money back? No.
Hurry, Mr.
Rooney.
We've got a disenchanted little girl in a Jell-O Pudding commercial.
I could play that.
So, Milhouse.
It must be a little tough givin' up all that glamour and comin' back to school, huh? Quiet! Maybe I can get my citizenship.
We know you don't have any more money left.
But that doesn't matter.
Just take whatever you need from our boutiques until you can get back on your feet.
Thank God we're back in Hollywood, where people treat each other right.
Shh!

The Simpsons D'oh! Here's your toast, Maggie.
I melba-fied it myself.
Oh, Lisa, honey, I tracked down those old newspapers for your history project.
Wow, Mom, you didn't have to go to this much trouble.
It was no trouble.
The hoboes at the dump were very helpful.
Except one man, who seemed to have mental problems.
Good morning.
It's class photo day.
No Dracula fangs.
- But they told us to wear 'em.
- No, they didn't.
Huh? And don't put signs on your sister! Now, keep the lettuce separate until 11:30.
That way, the lettuce stays moist and the bread stays dry.
Huh? Huh? - Mom, you fuss over us way too much.
- Enjoy it now.
Because when you're a grown-up you'll have to take care of yourself! Marge! There's a spider near my car keys! You did the right thing by telling me.
Shoo.
! Get outta here.
! That's better.
Now that we're alone, Papa Bear has a little honey for his Mama Bear.
"Good for a three-hour getaway at the Mingled Waters Health Spa"? Mineral bath? Facial massage? How did you afford these? Oh, never you mind.
What advantages does this motorcar have over, say, a train? Which I could also afford.
Well, you'll notice how the heated gas pedal warms your feet while- Gently massages your buttocks.
Well, Count Homer, shall we discuss the- No, we shan't.
Yoicks! Homie, this is so sweet.
But I can't possibly go now.
The sink is full of dirty dishes the trash needs to be taken out, the living room is a mess- - Oh, we'll clean up this afternoon.
- What about Maggie? I got my dad to look after her.
- Behind ya! - Don't do that! Don't do that! Come on, honey.
You work yourself stupid for this family.
If anyone deserves to be wrapped up in seaweed and buried in mud, it's you.
Mmm.
Well, all right.
But I'm taking some of the ironing with me in the car.
Tighten those braids, missy.
Hoist your flag, Doolie.
Nelson, you look adorable.
I feel like punchin' myself! Bart, stop scratching.
You're messing up your hair.
Lice? How on earth does a boy get head lice in this day and age? We bought a wicker basket from Trader Pete's, and he was passed out inside.
Hey, how come I get lice and nothing happens to Milhouse? So cold.
So very, very cold.
See ya in hell, you wingless bloodsuckers.
What kind of parents would permit such a lapse in "scalpal" hygiene? Well, you'd better check out his sister.
She could be rife with them "boogs" too.
Keep away! Hey, come on! Those are prescription shoes! I need them! You have cooties! - You have cooties! - No, I don't! Lisa Simpson, report to the principal's office for head lice inspection.
! Ooh.
! Cooties.
! Head lice.
! Oww! My tongue! Heads up.
! Principal Skinner, I need some "sooes.
" Sweet Georgia Brown! Something is rotten at the Simpson house! Mmm.
This is so relaxing.
Homie, this was a wonderful idea.
Yeah.
If that mafia guy weren't staring at us, I'd take off my towel.
Oh, don't mind-a me.
Look.
I do it first.
Whoa.
Would you look at this place? Sink full of dirty dishes.
Trash not taken out.
Living room a mess.
Stacks of old newspapers from 20 years ago.
Announcer.]
Get ready, gamblers, for the World Series of Dog Racing.
What the- But I- Hmm.
A disheveled and malnourished man found sleeping in his own filth.
Seems confused and dehydrated.
- Where's the baby? - Well, that's her, ain't it? Kids love that water.
Oh, my lord! Stupid babies need the most attention.
All is well.
All is well.
Turn tape over.
All is well.
All is well.
Children, where are your parents? I don't know.
They should be here.
Yes, they should be here.
Tsk-tsk-tsk.
Those parents better have a good excuse.
Oh, I love getting away from this dump.
It's like I'm on some wonderful drug.
- What's going on here? - Child welfare, ma'am.
Here's a little bedtime reading.
Mmm.
"Squalid hellhole"? "Toilet paper hung in improper overhand fashion"? "Dogs mating on dining room table"? What are you doing with my children? - We're taking them where you can't get them! - What? No! No! You can't! I won't let you! Mrs.
Simpson, restrain yourself, or you'll be arrested.
Now, just relax, kids.
All we're doing is taking you to a foster home! - Yea! - Hey-diddly-ho! Welcome to your new home, neglect-a-rinos! Kids, meet your new foster family.
We love you! Uh, please don't hug me.
It sickens me.
I don't judge Homer and Marge.
- That's for a vengeful God to do.
- Mm-hmm.
All we wanna do is give you kids a good home until they get their act together.
You don't understand.
Mom and Dad take good care of us.
That was a baby tooth.
It was loose! Don't you worry, little girl.
We'll get you some nice county dentures.
"Parents are not to communicate with children and must stay at least 100 feet away at all times.
" We leave you the kids for three hours, and the county takes 'em away? Oh, bitch, bitch, bitch! I can't believe I put my own pleasure ahead of my home and family.
That is so like me.
Oh, Marge, don't blame yourself.
I'm the terrible parent.
The boy bugs me the hell out of me, I can't help Lisa with her homework.
The only thing I'm fit to take care of is a house plant.
Lousy house plant! You son of a- I'll teach you to- D'oh-You- Go with it! Here you go, Todd.
The city edition.
Bart, I don't know if this should be an extra.
Is your source on this reliable? Oh, I hate this place! Yeah.
It seems like our house, but everything's got a creepy, Pat Boone-ish quality to it.
Hey, kids! Nachos, Flanders-style! That's cucumbers with cottage cheese! Oh, Bart.
I know you're still getting adjusted here.
Tell you what.
We'll do whatever you wanna do.
- Watch Itchy & Scratchy.
! - Well, I guess a little television won't hurt.
I used to let the boys watch My Three Sons, but it got 'em all worked up before bedtime.
The Itchy & Scratchy Show Aww! Why? Why? My only son.
Daddy, what's the red stuff coming out of kitty's ears? Uh, uh, that's, uh, just raspberry jam.
Dad, should I poke Rod with a sharp thing like the mouse did? No, son.
No, sirree, Bob.
- Can you see them? - I can see Lisa.
But it might be a starfish.
Yeesh! I gotta call 'em! The number you have dialed can no longer be reached from this phone you negligent monster.
- Ohh! - That's it! We're going downtown to get our kids back right now! We've always tried to be good parents.
Please, I'm begging you, one mother to another.
You must have a family.
No, I don't care for children.
Now, wait a minute! Okay, I'm not gonna win Father of the Year.
In fact, I'm probably the last guy in the world who should have kids.
Uh- W- W-Well, wait- Wait.
Can I start again? Fathering children is the best part of my day.
I'd do anything for Bart and Lisa.
- And, uh, Margaret? - Who? Lady, you got the wrong file.
- It's Maggie.
- Oh, Maggie.
I got nothin' against Maggie.
I can see you sincerely want your children back.
But you have a lot to learn about being parents.
Before I can return your children you'll have to complete a course called family skills.
- It teaches parents to listen to their- - Communication.
Gotcha.
- But it's important to- - Listen! Yes, I know! - But there's more to it than- - I have listening skills! - Mr.
Simpson, would you please- - Shut up, Judge! Peek-a-boo.
! I see you.
! Peek-a-boo! I see you! I never heard Maggie laugh like that before.
Well, when was the last time Dad gave her that kind of attention? When she swallowed that quarter, he spent all day with her.
I thought I could ride this thing out, but everything's just too weird here.
I know! They put honey on our pancakes instead of maple syrup.
And they read Newsweek instead of nothing! Come on, you gloomy Gusses.
Who's up for a big bowl on nonfat ice milk? - I want wintergreen.
- Unflavored for me.
And then I saw my boy in a burlap sack and they told me he had lice.
Is this story going somewhere? Easy there, Flub.
We're all gonna get a chance.
Mrs.
Skinner, why are you here? The county is threatening to take my Seymour away.
Oh, we had another fight over the inflatable bath pillow.
I kept screeching and screeching at him, but- All right, very good.
Who knows how the Skinners could have resolved this problem? Without resorting to violence.
Or childish name-calling.
Anybody? Okay.
That's okay.
Because making a happy home isn't like flipping on a light switch.
Duh, light switch? There are tricks to it, things you should have learned a long time ago such as, if you leave milk out, it can go sour.
Put it in the refrigerator, or, failing that, a cool, wet sack.
And put your garbage in a garbage can, people.
I can't stress that enough.
Don't just throw it out the window.
This is so humiliating.
Garbage in garbage can.
Hmm.
Makes sense.
Nighty-night, my sweet little foundling-a-dings.
But it's only 7:00.
Yeah! The sun is still out! Ohh! They say your folks can't pay the rent So we're watching you by act of government Well, I don't know if the allegations are true But you got us and, baby, we got you Babe We got you, babe You know, Maggie hasn't been a Simpson as long as us.
I think she's beginning to forget Mom and Dad.
Remember how Mom used to microwave our underwear on cold days? Or the way Dad used to call the radio station with fake traffic tips? They're ten feet away, and we can't even talk to them.
I wish I could tell them how much I miss them.
It's so quiet here without the kids.
What I wouldn't give to hear Lisa play another one of her jazzy tunes.
Saxo-mo-phone Saxo-mo-phone Ohh.
I miss the way Bart would say something and then say, "Dude.
" I wish I knew something about the baby I could miss now.
- You mean Maggie? - That's it.
I've never been separated from the kids for so long.
I don't know how much more I can take.
That's Bart's ring! "Todd Smells.
" - Oh, I already knew that.
- Look at the other side.
- Mmm.
- Ohh.
Okay, let's see if we've learned anything.
I want you two to simulate a typical household problem.
Go.
Uh, Pa, I cut myself on the screen door again.
Why, you cotton-pickin'- Hey! No.
I gotta pass this class for my kids.
Son, let's stop the fussin' and the feudin'.
I love you, Pa! I love you, Cletis! Well, children, it's Saturday night, so what say we let our hair down and play Bombardment- - Yea! - of Bible Questions! - Yea! - Which version shall it be? - St.
James! - The Vulgate of St.
Jerome.
! - Vulgate it is.
- Ohh.
Okay, for one gold star, what Persian king exempted the Levites from taxation? - Artaxerxes! - Righty-o! Tsk-tsk-tsk.
Well? - I know! - No, son, we gotta let Bart and Lisa get one.
Come on.
This one's easy.
We give up.
Well, guess! Book of Revelations.
Fire-breathing lion's head.
Tail made out of snakes.
Who else is it gonna be? - Jesus? - Je- Je- Ohh! Don't you kids know anything? The serpent of Reheboam? The well of Zohassadar? The bridal feast of Bethchedruharazzeb? That's the kind of thing you should start learning at baptism.
Um- actually, you see- we were never baptized.
- Oh! Neddie? Neddie! - Huh? Neddie! No, that ain't gonna do it.
I'm very proud of you people.
You've learned how to care for your children, how to maintain your homes and you've all passed the drug test.
Except for Marge.
Marge, you tested positive for crack and P.
C.
P.
Oh, my! Okay, the retest says you're clean.
Sorry about the mistake.
The only thing I'm high on is love- love for my son and daughters.
Yes, a little L.
S.
D.
is all I need.
All right.
Sounds very good.
Jeepers H.
Crackers! I'd better call the reverend.
Ned Flanders is on the phone.
Hello, Ned.
Reverend! Emergency! I-You see, the Simpson kids- Eedelee- I- B-Baptism- Oodelee- - Th- Doodly-diddly! - Ned.
Have you thought about one of the other major religions? They're all pretty much the same.
Damn Flanders.
Looks like I'm gonna have to baptize you myself.
Kids! We're good parents now! - Get your asses out here! - We missed you so much! He's going to baptize our children? Oh, no.
In the eyes of God, they'll be Flanderseseseses.
Until this, I never thought Homer and Marge were bad parents.
But now I know you kids need a less hell-bound family.
Just sit back, and before you know it you'll be part of the Flanders flock.
You're gonna be Lisa Flanders.
- You're gonna be Bart Flanders.
- Aaah! Oh, relax, Bart.
Your sister Maggie isn't scared.
That's because she can't talk.
Daddily-doodily.
- Where are we going? Where are we going? - Okay, okay.
Don't panic.
To find Flanders, I just have to think like Flanders.
I'm a big, four-eyed lame-o and I wear the same stupid sweater every day, and- The Springfield River! I once was lost But now am found Was blind, but now I See-e-e-e Today we write a new page in the Flanders family Bible.
Who wants to be the first to enter God's good graces? Easy.
Easy! Oh, why do you hate my trains? Ooh- Son of a- Eee- Ohh- Ooh! Do you reject Satan and all his empty promises? No-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o! - Mmm! - Wow, Dad! You took a baptismal for me.
How do you feel? Oh, Bartholomew, I feel like St.
Augustine of Hippo after his conversion by Ambrose of Milan.
Wait.
! Homer.
! What did you just say? - I said, shut your ugly face, Flanders! - Oh.
Fair enough.
Oh, there's my sweet little Maggie.
Oh, Maggie, you're a Simpson again.
- So, what was it like at the Flanders' house? - Yeah, give me all the dirt.
Let's see.
Dirt.
Dirt.
Well, there wasn't really much dirt.
There was a bunch of old paint cans in their garage though.
Ol' Painty-can Ned! I always knew he'd keep his old cans of paint.
! I always knew he'd keep his old cans of paint.
! Yeah.
! How do you like that? Shh!

The Simpsons D'oh! Hymns here! I got hymns here! Get 'em while they're holy! Fresh from God's brain to your mouth! And now please rise for our opening hymn uh, "In the Garden of Eden" by I.
Ron Butterfly.
In the garden of Eden, honey Don't you know that I love you In the garden of Eden, baby Don't you know that I'll always be true Hey, Marge, remember when we used to make out to this hymn? Shh! Shh! Shh! Oh, won't ya come with me And take my hand Wait a minute.
This sounds like rock and/or roll.
And walk this land I know one of you is responsible for this.
So repeat after me: If I withhold the truth, may I go straight to hell where I will eat naught but burning-hot coals and drink naught but burning-hot cola.
Where fiery demons will punch me in the back where my soul will be chopped into confetti and strewn upon a parade of murderers and single mothers where my tongue will be torn out by ravenous birds.
Bart did it! - That Bart right there! - Milhouse! Milhouse, you did the right thing.
Bart, come with me for punishment.
You too, snitchy.
I want you to clean every one of these organ pipes that you have befouled with your popular music.
You shank! How could you tell on me? Well, I didn't want hungry birds pecking my soul forever.
Soul? Come on, Milhouse.
There's no such thing as a soul.
It's just something they made up to scare kids like the boogeyman, or MichaelJackson.
But every religion says there's a soul, Bart.
Why would they lie? What would they have to gain? I don't hear scrubbing! If your soul's real, where is it? It's kinda in here and when you sneeze, that's your soul trying to escape.
Saying "God bless you" crams it back in and when you die it squirms out and flies away.
Uh-huh.
What if you die in a submarine at the bottom of the ocean? Oh, it can swim.
It's even got wheels, in case you die in the desert and it has to drive to the cemetery.
How can someone with glasses that thick be so stupid? Listen, you don't have a soul, I don't have a soul.
- There's no such thing as a soul! - Fine.
If you're so sure about that, why don't you sell your soul to me? How much you got? - Five bucks.
- Deal.
There you go.
One soul.
Pleasure doing business with you.
Anytime, chum p.
All right, where would you kids like to eat tonight? The Spaghetti Laboratory! Face-Stuffers! Professor V.
J.
Cornucopia's Fantastic Foodmagorium and Great American Steakery.
Well, what about this place? Moe's.
Aah! Natural light! Get it off me! Get it off me! Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought this was a family restaurant.
Oh, it is.
It is.
Just, uh, pull them stools up to the pool table.
Daddy, this place smells like tinkle! Mm-hmm.
I think we'll just go to the Texas Cheesecake Depository.
Everybody is going to family restaurants these days.
Seems nobody wants to hang out in a dank pit no more.
You ain't thinkin' of gettin' rid of the dank, are ya, Moe? Ahh, maybe I am.
Ah, but, Moe, the dank- the dank! Yeah, family restaurants.
That's where the big bucks are.
I could turn this joint into a place where you wouldn't be ashamed to bring your family! I'm not ashamed.
Hey, put a coaster under that.
Oh, Lisa! There's a little present for you lying in the driveway! Oh, boy! Really? Aaah! No! It's dripping funny-smelling water all over me! I wasted five bucks on these.
Where'd you get five bucks? I want five bucks.
- I sold my soul to Milhouse.
- What? How could you do that? Your soul is the most valuable part of you.
You believe in that junk? Well, whether or not the soul is physically real, Bart it's the symbol of everything fine inside us.
Tsk-tsk-tsk.
Poor, gullible Lisa.
I'll keep my crappy sponges, thanks.
Bart, your soul is the only part of you that lasts forever.
For five dollars, Milhouse could own you for a zillion years.
Well, if you think he got such a good deal, I'll sell you my conscience for 4.
50.
I'll throw in my sense of decency too.
It's a Bart sales event! Everything about me must go! Hey, boy.
How ya doin'? Man! What's gotten into you? Geez! You're pretty uppity for someone who eats bugs all day.
Stupid automatic door.
Thank you, door! Some ice cream guy's gonna see that, and it'll blow his mind.
! Let me try.
Way to breathe, No-Breath.
This is getting weird.
Sanjay, to the entrance with the Windex.
Sanjay, to the entrance with the Windex.
So, come on.
I need a name that says friendly, all-American cooking.
How about Chairman Moe's Magic Wok? I like it! Nah.
I want something that says people can have a nice, relaxing time.
I got it! Madman Moe's Pressure Cooker! I like it! Hey, how about Uncle Moe's Family Feedbag? I hate it.
Oh, boy! The deep fryer's here.
I got it used from the navy.
You could flash-fry a buffalo in 40 seconds.
Forty seconds? But I want it now! The Itchy & Scratchy Show Ah! I know that's funny, but I'm just not laughing.
Hmm.
Pablo Neruda said laughter is the language of the soul.
I am familiar with the works of Pablo Neruda.
I think we should do a test.
D'oh! Help! Help! - Somebody help me! I'm stuck in a banister! - Well? - Nope.
I don't feel a thing.
- That's creepy, Bart.
- I think you really did lose your soul.
- Good boy! Ow! Ow! Who's doing that? - Hmm? - Nothing.
Ow! Help me! Ow! Why isn't anybody- Ow! helping? Hi.
Is Milhouse home? He's playing in the dirt with his army men.
Oh, and a white piece of paper, I believe.
Cover me, Sarge.
I'm going after Bart's soul.
If the ayatollah can't have it, no one can! - Uh, you know, Milhouse- - Ye-e-e-es? - Bet you're gettin' tired of that soul, huh? - No! Well, suppose someone wanted to buy it from you.
Oh.
You wanna buy it back, Bart? Sure.
No problem.
- Fifty bucks.
- What? Who's stupid now, huh? If you like good food, good fun and a whole lot of crazy crap on the walls then come on down to Uncle Moe's Family Feedbag.
At Moe's, we serve good, old-fashioned home cooking deep-fried to perfection.
Now, that's "Moe" like it! So bring the whole family- mom, dad, kids.
Uh, no old people.
They're not covered by our insurance.
It's fun! And remember our guarantee.
If I'm not smiling when your check comes, your meal's on me- Uncle Moe! Come to Uncle Moe's for family fun It's good, good, good, good Good-good-good Mmm! Sounds good.
Mmm! Hmm.
Bart, what's wrong? There's something a little off about your hug.
Mom, I need to tell you something.
I kind of- Uh-uh! Uh-uh! Let me guess.
A mother can always tell.
Mm-mmm.
Hmm.
It's not fear of nuclear war.
Mm-mmm.
It's not swim test anxiety.
It almost feels like you're missing something- something important.
Like I don't have a soul? Aw, honey.
You're not a monster.
My soul's my best friend.
! My soul's like a toy that never breaks.
- I'm master blaster! - My soul can take your soul.
! Bart sold his soul And that's just swell Now he's going straight to Hello, operator Give me number nine No soul, huh? Don't worry.
I'm still behind ya.
Ha-ha! Ahoy there, friends! Everybody find a first mate! Oh! I choose Martin! Wait.
Wait for me! Bart, it's time to end this dream And don't forget the standard scream An alligator with sunglasses? Huh! Now I've seen everything.
Hiya, folks.
Welcome to Uncle Moe's.
Aw, look at all the cute little minors.
Wow, that's Moe.
The guy from the ad! Right this way, Homer.
And he knows my name! Street signs indoors? Whatever! Now, Rod, you order anything you want for your big 10-0.
Million-dollar birthday fries! Uh-oh! "Moe gets so excited when you order his million-dollar birthday fries he just has to celebrate.
" Here you go! Here I am! Uncle Moe! Thank you, ma'am! This'll be a treat! Uncle Moe! Here I am, while you eat! Please take the fries off my head, kid.
The basket is extremely hot.
How are the southwestern pizza fingers? Uh, they're, um, "awesomely outrageous.
" Oh, these look good- "Guilt-Free Steak-fish Fillets.
" Let me level with you, Marge.
That's just our name for bottom-feeding suction eel.
You don't want that.
Why don't you try Moe's Hobo Chicken Chili.
I start with the best part- the neck.
And then I add secret hobo spices.
Ooh! TrÃ¨s bien.
! Yeah.
What the hell are you doing, you little freak? Ooh, sorry, kid.
Sorry.
I'm not used to the laughter of children.
It cuts through me like a dentist's drill.
But, no, that was funny, you taking away my dignity like that.
Ha-ha.
I would like to say grace.
Lord, have mercy on my soul and Mom's soul, and Dad's soul, and Maggie's soul.
And let every soul in Christendom- Bart! I can't take this anymore! I want my soul, and I want it now! Bart! You didn't finish your spaghetti and Moe-balls! Silence, you fool.
It can be ours.
Run, boy! Run! Run for your life boy.
! Milhouse.
Milhouse, you win.
I want this nightmare to end.
Leave this place.
You are in great danger.
Where's Milhouse? The one you call Milhouse is gone.
He went to his grandma's place while we're sprayin' for potato bugs.
Oh.
When Milhouse left, did you notice if he was carrying a piece of paper? Oh, yeah.
You don't forget a thing like that.
Oh, God.
Here you go! Here I am! Uncle Moe! Thank you, ma'am! This'll be a treat! Uncle Moe! Here I am, while you eat! - Yea! Now do it for Terri! - What, it's your birthday too? We're twins.
Here you go.
Here I am.
Eat your fries.
Eat 'em.
Here's you! Aw, geez.
And you got the stink lines and everything? Oh, dude, you did not smile.
We eat for free.
Come on, Shoshana.
Let's roll.
Ha-ha! But I sang you the potato stuffings! Come on! I sang you the potato stuffings! Look at the vein on that guy's forehead.
He's gonna blow! Unkie Moe? What is it, sweetheart? My sodie is too cold.
My teef hurt.
Oh, your "teef" hurt, huh? Your "teef" hurt? Well, that's too freakin' bad! I'll tell you where you can put your freakin' "sodie" too! Oh, my goodness.
! Ow! My freakin' ears! Oh, let's go, dear.
Well, I expect that type of language at Denny's, but not here! Aw, come on, folks, wait.
Please come back.
Please! I got a new offer.
Whenever Uncle Moe threatens you, you get a free steak-fish.
Okay, okay, Milhouse's grandmother lives on 257 th Street and I'm on 3rd.
Ohh.
Well, finally, a little luck.
I know you and your wife and every part of you Son, you wait here while Daddy tries to talk some sense into this raving derelict.
Ah, what the hell do you want- You still owe me $50- Slow down.
Slow down! Alfred Hitchcock stole every idea I ever had! He came into my room and- Who's been stealing your thoughts? Did you ever read The Old Curiosity Shop? They made that with John Gielgud- I have powers that- - Hello, Ralph.
- Aah! Uh, hi, Bart.
I know you from school.
Yes.
A simple proposition, Ralph.
How would you like to make a dollar? Uh, I don't know.
All you have to do is sign a paper that says I can have your soul.
I need a soul, Ralph.
Any soul.
Yours! Hey! What's going on over there? Go on, take it all.
Get it all outta here.
You know, Moe, you might wanna keep the fire extinguishers.
Nah.
Too many bad memories.
Well, look at the bright side, Moe- you still got us.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You know, that actually makes me feel a little better.
Why? That was the problem in the first place.
You were going broke because we were your only customers.
Wasn't that the problem in the first place, that you were going broke? Moe? Moe? Hey! Moe? You're thinking about all the money you blew, aren't ya? What was it, Look, maybe it would help if you went over all the mistakes you made from the beginning.
Moe? - What? - Let me get a pad.
A caller, at this hour? You dial "9-1," then when I say so, dial "1" again.
Milhouse, please.
Bart, I can't play now.
It's 2:00 a.
m.
Milhouse, I gotta have my soul back.
I'll do anything you want.
Uh, well- Uh, Milhouse, give him back his soul! I've got work tomorrow! I'm really sorry.
I kinda traded your soul to the guy at the comic book store.
But look- I got some cool pogs.
Alf pogs! Remember Alf? He's back, in pog form! You traded my soul for pogs? No! Close that door.
! You're letting the heat out.
! Shut up, shut up, shut up.
! If you are waiting for the Hi and Lois signing it has been moved to the Springfield Coliseum.
Please.
You have something of mine on a piece of paper.
Oh.
So you're Bart Simpson.
Since my breakfast burrito is congealing rapidly, I will be blunt.
You are too late.
I sold your soul last night.
Yes, yes.
I found a buyer right away for that item.
- Who? - I am not at liberty to divulge the party.
But they were most interested in having possession of a little boy's soul.
Uh, excuse me.
No banging your head on the display case, please.
It contains a very rare Mary Worth in which she has advised a friend to commit suicide, thank you.
Are you there, God? It's me, Bart Simpson.
I know I never pay too much attention in church but I could really use some of that good stuff now.
I'm afraid.
I'm afraid some weirdo's got my soul, and I don't know what they're doing to it.
I just want it back.
Please? I hope you can hear this.
Lisa! You bought this? With the change in my piggy bank.
There's no change in your piggy bank.
Not in any of the ones you know about.
- Oh, Lise, thank you.
- Happy to do it.
But you know, Bart, some philosophers believe that nobody is born with a soul that you have to earn one through suffering and thought and prayer like you did last night.
Uh-huh.
Ha.
! It's like punting on the Thames.
Stroke.
Stroke.
Oh! Shh!

The Simpsons D'oh! - Are we there yet? - No.
- Are we there yet? - No.
- Are we there yet? - No.
- Where are we going? - We're going to Storytown Village, Grampa.
It's an amusement park for babies.
- Oh! Just leave me in the car with the window open a crack.
- That's the plan.
I think it's nice we're doing something Maggie will enjoy for once.
Besides, I'm sure Storytown Village is also fun for everyone from eight to God only knows.
Come out.
Come out or I'll blow your house in.
Not by the hairs on our chinny chin chins.
- What a load of crappy crap crap! - Quiet, boy.
I have a feeling some bad stuff is about to go down.
This is where the wolf blows down the pigs' house.
He blows, all right.
He blows big-time.
That's it, honey.
Get into the spirit.
Uh, it was good, but not great.
Somebody's been sleeping in my bed.
Somebody's been sleeping in my bed.
Somebody's been sleeping in my bed.
Well, I'm sorry.
But it was a 150 degrees in the car.
So long, su-Aah! Come on! Eat the can! Come on! You're supposed to feed them pellets from the machine over there.
Huh? Oh, my! Out of the way, you.
! Ahhh.
Oh, you are so cute.
Yes, you are.
You are.
I just love you.
See? It was a good idea to come here after all.
Attention, families.
This is Mother Goose.
The following cars have been broken into- Hmm? Allemande left and do-si-diddley-diddley-do Swing your partner to-and-froodilly-fro - All rightilly-dightilly.
- Hey, Flanders.
Hidilly-ho, neighboreeno! - Shut up! - Okilly-dokilly.
So, Ned, you're having a family reunion and you didn't invite me? Oh, gosh, Homer.
This is strictly a Flanders affair.
I got family here from around the globe.
- Here's JosÃ© Flanders.
- Buenos ding-dong-diddly-dÃ­as, senor.
- And this is Lord Thistlewick Flanders.
- Charmed.
Eh, a-googilly-doogilly.
I can't believe you didn't invite me, after I painted those cool stripes all over your car.
I know! I'll throw my own barbecue! The greatest barbecue this town has ever seen.
And I'll only invite who I want.
That'll show you.
- Can I come? - Sure.
D'oh! This barbecue will be hard, thankless work.
But I'm sure you're up to it, Marge.
Well, it could be a good chance to get to know our neighbors outside of a courtroom setting.
You know what you should serve, Marge? More of these lamb chops.
These are the best ever.
Why, thank you, Homie.
You might say the extra ingredient is salt.
Please, Lisa.
I thought you loved me.
Loved me.
What's wrong, Lisa? Didn't you get enough lamb chops? I can't eat this.
I can't eat a poor little lamb.
Lisa, get ahold of yourself.
This is "lamb," not "a lamb.
" What's the difference between this lamb and the one that kissed me? This one spent two hours in the broiler.
Bart, sensible bites.
! All right, Lisa.
If you don't want lamb chops, there's lots of other things I can make.
Chicken breast, rump roast - hot dogs.
- No, I can't! - I can't eat any of them! - Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
Lisa, honey, are you saying you're never going to eat any animal again? - What about bacon? - No.
- Ham? - No.
- Pork chops? - Dad! Those all come from the same animal! Oh, yeah, right, Lisa.
A wonderful, magical animal.
I think Lisa's right, Dad.
Eating meat is ba-a-a-ad.
Hey, that's my chop! Oh, my family just doesn't understand my newfound vegetarianism.
Compared to them, the public schools are a haven of enlightenment.
Okay, class, time to dissect our worms.
First, pin them down so they don't fly up and hit you in the eye.
- Um, Miss Hoover? - Yes, Ralph? What is it? My worm went in my mouth and then I ate it.
Can I have a new one? No, Ralph.
There aren't any more.
Just try to sleep while the other children are learning.
Oh, boy! Sleep! That's where I'm a Viking.
Lisa, what did I ever do to you-ou-ou? Why does it talk like a lamb? Uh, Miss Hoover, I don't think I can dissect an animal.
I think it's wrong.
Okay, Lisa.
I respect your moral objection.
Um, excuse me.
- Isn't there anything here that doesn't have meat in it? - Possibly the meat loaf.
Well, I believe you're required to provide a vegetarian alternative.
Yum.
It's rich in bunly goodness.
Do you remember when you lost your passion for this work? - Uh-oh.
Two independent thought alarms in one day.
The students are over-stimulated.
Willie, remove all the colored chalk from the classrooms.
I warned ya! Didn't I warn ya? That colored chalk was forged by Lucifer himself! The Itchy and Scratchy Show Mmm! Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.
Mmm! I never realized before, but some Itchy and Scratchy cartoons send the message that violence against animals is funny.
Say what? Cartoons don't have messages, Lisa.
They're just a bunch of hilarious stuff, you know, like people getting hurt and stuff.
- Stuff like that- Ohh! - Look, kids.
I just got my party invitations back from the printers.
"Come to Homer's BBBQ.
The extra 'B' is for BYOBB.
" - What's that extra "B" for? - That's a typo.
Dad, can't you have some other kind of party? One where you don't serve meat? But all normal people love meat.
If I went to a barbecue and there was no meat, I would say, "Yo, goober! Where's the meat?" I'm trying to impress people here, Lisa.
You don't win friends with salad.
You don't win friends with salad You don't win friends with salad You don't win friends with salad You don't win friends with salad You don't win friends with salad You don't win friends with salad You don't win friends with salad You don't win friends with salad - You don't win friends with salad - Mom! I didn't mean to take sides.
I just got caught up in the rhythm.
Good morning, class.
A certain agitator- For privacy's sake, let's call her Lisa S.
No, that's too obvious.
Uh, let's say L.
Simpson- has raised questions about certain school policies.
So, in the interest of creating an open dialogue, sit silently and watch this film.
Nothing beats a stroll in cattle country.
Hi, I'm Troy McClure.
You may remember me from such educational films as Two Minus Three Equals Negative Fun.
! - And Firecrackers: The Silent Killer.
- Mr.
McClure? - Oh, hello, Bobby.
- Jimmy.
I'm curious as to how meat gets from the ranch to my stomach.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down, Jimmy.
You just asked a mouthful.
It all starts here in the high-density feedlot.
Then when the cattle are just right- Mmm! it's time for them to "graduate" from Bovine University.
Come on, Jimmy.
Let's take a peek at the killing floor.
Don't let the name throw you, Jimmy.
It's not really a floor.
It's more of a steel grating that allows material to sluice through so it can be collected and exported.
Getting hungry, Jimmy? Uh, Mr.
McClure, I have a crazy friend who says it's wrong to eat meat.
- Is he crazy? - No, just ignorant.
You see, your crazy friend never heard of the food chain.
- Just ask this scientician.
- Uh- He'll tell you that in nature one creature invariably eats another to survive.
Don't kid yourself, Jimmy.
If a cow ever got the chance, he'd eat you and everyone you care about.
Wow, Mr.
McClure! I was a Grade A moron to ever question eating meat.
Yes, you were, Jimmy.
Yes, you were.
Ow.
You're hurting me.
They can't seriously expect us to swallow that tripe.
Now as a special treat, courtesy of our friends at the meat council please help yourselves to this tripe.
Stop it.
! Stop it.
! Don't you realize you've just been brainwashed by corporate propaganda? Apparently, my crazy friend here hasn't heard of the food chain.
Yeah.
Lisa's a Grade A moron.
When I grow up, I'm going to Bovine University.
Hi, Homer.
Thanks for inviting me to your barbecue.
Whoa, Barney! You brought a whole beer keg! Yeah.
Where can I fill it up? Wait, Dad.
! Good news, everyone.
! You don't have to eat meat! I made enough gazpacho for all! - I don't like gazpacho.
- What's that anyway? It's tomato soup served ice cold.
Go back to Russia.
Ah, diagnosis delicious.
I've got the prescription for you, Doctor.
Another hot beef injection.
Hey, Homer.
Bring me another one of them, uh, burgers, would you? I can't quite seem to stand up under my own power anymore.
One whopper for the copper.
- Another burger, Dad? - Here you go! It's bad enough they're all eating meat.
They don't have to rub it in my face.
Okay, everybody.
It's the moment you've all been waiting for.
The pig de rÃ©sistance.
Look at his nose.
Congratulations, Homer.
Your "Q" is a huge success.
Hey, a toast to the host who can boast the most roast! Thanks, Flanders.
I have to agree that everything certainly- Huh? Bart! No! - What? - Sorry.
Force of habit.
Lisa! No! Uhh! Ohh! It's just a little dirty.
It's still good.
It's still good.
It's just a little slimy.
It's still good.
It's still good.
It's just a little airborne.
It's still good.
It's still good.
- It's gone.
- I know.
You know, Smithers, I think I'll donate a million dollars to the local orphanage when pigs fly.
- That's a good one.
Hey- Hey- - Wh-Wha- - Will you be donating that million dollars now, sir? - No.
I'd still prefer not.
Give it up, Dad.
Piggy ain't coming back.
Lisa, you ruined my barbecue! I demand you apologize this second! I'm never, ever apologizing, because I was standing up for a just cause! And you were wrong, wrong, wrong! - Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to my room! - That's it! Go to your room! Marge, since I'm not talking to Lisa would you please ask her to pass me the syrup? Please pass your father the syrup, Lisa.
Bart, tell Dad I'll only pass the syrup if it won't be used on any meat product.
You dunking your sausages in that syrup, homeboy? Marge, tell Bart I just want to drink a nice glass of syrup like I do every morning.
Tell him yourself.
You're ignoring Lisa, not Bart.
Bart, thank your mother for pointing that out.
Homer, you're not not talking to me.
And, secondly, I heard what you said.
Lisa, tell your mother to get off my case.
Uh, Dad, Lisa's the one you're not talking to.
- Bart, go to your room! - Why don't you just eat him, Dad? I don't need any serving suggestions from you you barbecue-wrecking, know-nothing, know-it-all.
That's it! I can't live in a house with this prehistoric carnivore! I am out of here! That's it! Go to your room! Look! It's Mrs.
Potato Head.
She has a head made out of lettuce.
I can't believe I used to go out with you.
Are you gonna marry a carrot, Lisa? Yes, I'm gonna marry a carrot.
- She admitted it! - She admitted she's gonna marry a carrot! I can't believe it.
Your windows.
Mmm! The next- The whole world wants me to eat meat! I can't fight it anymore! There! Is everybody happy now? I take it from your yelling that you like my tofu dogs.
- Tofu? - Oh, yes.
No meat whatsoever.
And only thrice the fat of a normal hot dog.
- I made the switch and nobody noticed.
- But why, Apu? Because I'm a vegetarian.
Haven't you ever seen my T-shirt? - That's cute.
- Here.
Let me show you something, Lisa.
Wow! A secret staircase.
But what do you do if somebody wants a nonalcoholic beer? You know, it's never come up.
Oh, Apu, it's beautiful.
Yes.
This is where I come when I need some refuge from the modern world or when I want to see drive-in movies for free.
I know it is not easy to be a vegetarian, Lisa.
- That's why I ran away from home.
- What? She's leaving home? Wow.
! Paul McCartney.
! I read about you in history class.
But where's your wife, Linda? Right here, Lisa.
Whenever we're in Springfield we like to hang out in Apu's garden in the shade.
We met him in India years ago during the Maharishi days.
- Back then I was known as the fifth Beatle.
- Sure you were, Apu.
You know what, Lisa? Paul and Linda are vegetarians too.
In fact, Linda has her own line of vegetarian entrees.
Apu, I'm sure the last thing they want to talk about is- We weren't satisfied with the other vegetarian meals on the market.
You'd be surprised how often you'd find a big hunk of pork in them.
- Ew! - Linda and I both feel strongly about animal rights.
In fact, if you play "Maybe I'm Amazed" backwards you'll hear a recipe for a really ripping lentil soup.
When will all those fools learn that you can be perfectly healthy simply eating vegetables, fruits, grains and cheese? - Ooh, cheese! - You don't eat cheese, Apu? No, I don't eat any food that comes from an animal.
Oh! Then you must think I'm a monster.
Yes, indeed, I do think that.
But I learned long ago, Lisa, to tolerate others rather than forcing my beliefs on them.
You know, you can influence people without badgering them always.
It's like Paul's song, "Live and Let Live.
" - It was "Live and Let Die.
" - Whatever, whatever.
It had a good rhythm.
I guess I have been pretty hard on a lot of people, especially my dad.
Thanks, you guys.
Lisa, before you go, would you like to hear a song? - Wow! That'd be great! - Okay.
Take it, Apu.
Lisa.
Lisa! Lisa, come back before everyone finds out what a horrible father I am! Hi, Dad.
Looking for me? - I don't know.
Were you looking for me? - I don't know.
Oh, Lisa.
I was looking for you.
I wanted to apologize.
I don't know exactly what went wrong, but I know it's always my fault.
Actually, Dad, this time I was wrong- - Oh.
- too.
While I was gone, I got some really good advice from Paul and Linda McCartney.
Rock stars.
Is there anything they don't know? I still stand by my beliefs.
But I can't defend what I did.
I'm sorry I messed up your barbecue.
I understand, honey.
I used to believe in things when I was a kid.
Come on! I'll give you a piggyback ride- Uh, oops! I mean, a veggieback ride home.
Come on.

Ah, the Miracle Mile, where value wears a neon sombrero and there's not a single church or library to offend the eye.
There it is! The chain that put the "fat" in fat Southern sheriffs.
! I want a colossal doughnut, just like the one on the sign.
D'oh! Nuts! That's false advertising! Sorry, sir.
No refunds.
I paid for a colossal doughnut and I'm gonna get a colossal doughnut.
You don't scare us.
Astronomers from Tacoma to Vladivostok havejust reported an ionic disturbance in the vicinity of the Van Allen belt.
Scientists are recommending that all necessary precautions be taken.
Eggheads.
What do they know? Hee-hee-hee! I got your doughnut, Lard Lad! And what are you gonna do about it? Homer, where did you get that? - Get what? - That giant doughnut.
Well, I acquired it legally.
You can be sure of that.
Dude, you're huge! Yeah! Let's party, baby! Hey-hey-hey! Fellas, where you going at this hour? Hey, don't scratch up them heads! Good morning, everybody.
Panic is gripping Springfield as giant advertising mascots rampage through the city.
Perhaps it's part of some daring new ad campaign.
But what new product could justify such carnage? A cleanser? A fat-free fudge cake that doesn't let you down in the flavor department like so many others- Let me go! No! Stop! No! Whoa! Another acid flashback.
Man, I'd hate to be driving a bus right now! Aw, they're not so tough.
Chief, that wasn't a monster.
That was the captain of the high school basketball team.
Uh, yeah, well, he was turning into a monster though.
What are you waiting for? Wreck the school.
You know you wanna.
- I agree.
Destroy the school.
- Hmm.
Hello? Yes? Oh.
If you're looking for that big doughnut of yours, Flanders has it.
Just smash open his house.
He came to life.
Good for him! Help me, Lord.
! I told you, Flanders has it! Or Moe.
Go kill Moe.
Just give him the doughnut! Once he has it, that will be the end of all this horror! Well, okay.
If it'll end horror.
Don't you ever get tired of being wrong all the time? Sometimes.
These monsters are destroying everything and everyone we hold dear! And you kids should have jackets on.
Hey! What's that in his footprint? Hmm.
If your advertising agency created all those giant characters you must know how to stop them.
Well, sir, advertising is a funny thing.
If people stop paying attention to it, pretty soon it goes away.
- Like that old woman who couldn't find the beef? - Exactly! If you stop paying attention to the monsters, they'll lose their powers.
But people can't help looking at them.
They're wrecking the town.
You know, maybe a jingle would help.
Don't watch the mon- Don't watch the monsters-s-s-s Well, it'll sound a lot better coming out of Paul Anka.
Hey, Springfield.
! Are you suffering from the heartbreak of monsteritis? Then take a tip from Mr.
Paul Anka! To stop those monsters one, two, three Here's a fresh new way that's trouble-free It's got Paul Anka's guarantee Guarantee void in Tennessee Just don't look Just don't look Just don't look Just don't look Just don't look Just don't look It worked! They're all dead! Well, except for chubsy-ubsy over there.
Mmm.
Sprinkles! - Homer, stop looking! - Don't make us poke your eyes out, Dad.
Ohh! Here comes something.
Remember the story.
We're newlyweds on our way to Earth capital.
Oh, shazbatt! Even as I speak, the scourge of advertising could be heading toward your town! Lock your doors! Bar your windows! Because the next advertisement you see could destroy your house and eat your family.
We'll be right back.
Okay, boy.
Catch the Frisbee.
Good catch, boy.
Thanks, Bart.
Oh, hard luck.
Glad to "rake" your acquaintance.
It was only a dream.
Bart.
! Is that you? - Yes! - Take out the garbage.
And then he raked me across the chest.
And the weirdest thing was, it was that school janitor who mysteriously disappeared! - Groundskeeper Willie! - Oh, my god! Bart, Groundskeeper Willie was in my nightmare too.
But he got me with hedge clippers.
He ran his floor buffer over me! Children, I couldn't help monitoring your conversation.
There's no mystery about Willie.
Why, he simply disappeared.
Now, let's have no more curiosity about this bizarre cover-up.
Remember, class, the worse you do on this standardized test the more funding the school gets, so don't knock yourselves out.
- You have three hours to- - Finished! Then put your head down on your desk and sit quietly.
Ahh.
A duet of pleasures.
I am the Wondrous Wizard of Latin! I am a dervish of declension and a conjurer of conjugation with a million hit points and maximum charisma! Ah-ha! Morire: To die! Morit: He, she, or it dies! Moris: You die! You've mastered a dead tongue! But can you handle a live one? Ha-ha! Wheel him out quietly.
It's best the children don't see him.
Oh, just get it out of here! Not into the kindergarten! Mom! Dad! Martin died at school today! Ohhh! I don't see what that has to do with Groundskeeper Willie.
Um, we didn't mention Groundskeeper Willie, Mom.
Kids, it's time we told you the true story and put your fears to rest.
It's a story of murder and revenge from beyond the grave.
It all started on the 13th hour of the 13th day of the 13th month.
We were there to discuss the misprinted calendars the school had purchased.
Lousy "Smarch" weather.
"Do not touch Willie.
" Good advice.
Huh? - Our next budget item, $12 for doorknob repair.
- Nay! Recharge fire extinguishers.
- This is a free service of the fire department.
- Nay! Help! Please help me! Willie, please! Mr.
Van Houten has the floor.
I, for one, would like to see the cafeteria menus in advance so parents can adjust their dinner menus accordingly.
I don't like the idea of Milhouse having two spaghetti meals in one day.
You'll pay for this with your children's blood! Oh, right.
How you gonna get 'em? Skeleton power? I'll strike where you cannot protect them- in their dreams! Bart, don't you realize what this means? The next time we fall asleep, we could die.
Bah! Welcome to my world.
Announcer.]
On this edition of Asian Market Wrap-up.
There's a volcano waiting to erupt in the Pacific Rim.
It's nine medium-term, convertible debentures- It's no use, Bart.
- We can't stay up forever! - You're right.
The only thing left to do is go into my dream and force Willie into a final showdown.
You stay awake.
And if it looks like I'm in trouble, wake me up.
Okay.
But promise you won't be grouchy.
Come on, Willie.
I know you're out there.
The sandbox.
! Hey, Lawn Boy.
! You missed a spot.
! When I'm done with you, they'll have to do a "compost-mortem!" Sinky sand! No! Help! Willie's gone for good.
Now I can get back to my normal dreams- me and Krusty winning the Super Bowl.
Bart, there's two seconds left.
Listen up.
It's your basic Statue of Liberty play with one twist.
You throw it to me.
Knute Rockne called it "the forward pass.
" Now, the clock's still running, so it's important we start this play as quickly as possible.
Oh-ho, boy! Don't dream about me no more, kid.
Help! Lisa, help! - Bart, you're in trouble! Wake up! - Wait a minute.
If you're here, then you've fallen asleep too.
I'm not asleep.
I'm just resting my eye- Uh-oh.
- Good-bye, Bart.
- Good-bye, Lise.
I hope you get reincarnated as someone who can stay awake for 15 minutes.
You saved us, Maggie! I don't know, Bart.
Something tells me Willie's still out there, and that he could come back any time, in any form, and kill us in ways we can't even imagine! Boo! Here I am.
Yah! No! Stop! I left my gun on the seat! Hey! Wait here, please.
Aw, geez! Homer, get ready.
! Patty and Selma will be here any minute.
! Oh, no! Better ride this one out in the closet.
Sorry, Dad.
This is our spot.
Oh, yeah? Well, it's my house, so it's my spot.
- Nu-uh, because we called it.
- Did not.
- Well, we're calling it now.
- You are? - 'Fraid so.
- Ohh! They got me with their legal mumbo jumbo! Just a second.
! Huh? I never looked behind this whatchamacallit case before.
Huh? That's weird.
It's like something out of that twilight-y show about that zone.
How's it hangin', Marge? Yuck! I'm baking like a meat loaf under this wet wool.
Uh, may I take your coat, Aunt Selma? Um, I would also like to take your coat.
Have we got a family activity for you! A pillow case full of seashells from our trip to Sulfur Bay.
You're gonna help us clean and organize them.
And pry out all the dead hermit crabs.
Get a screwdriver.
I'll take my chances in the mystery wall! Oh, glory of glories! Oh, heavenly testament to the eternal majesty of God's creation! Holy macaroni! Hey, you can just suck 'em out.
Hello? Can anybody hear me? Homer, where are you? Uh, I'm somewhere where I don't know where I am.
! Do you see towels? If you see towels, you're probably in the linen closet again.
Just a second.
No, it's a place I've never been before.
Uh-huh.
The shower.
Hey.
! I don't want to alarm you, Marge but I seem to be trapped in here.
We'd better call Ned.
He has a ladder.
What's going on here? I'm so bulgy.
My stomach sticks way out in front and my- Well, as the tree said to the lumberjack, I'm stumped.
It's like he just disappeared into fat air.
Hey, shut up! Mmm! Unprocessed fish sticks.
Man, this place looks expensive! I feel like I'm wasting a fortune just standing here.
Better make the most of it.
Ow! Watch it, coney! Whoops.
- Do you see a light, Homer? - Yes.
Move into the light, my son.
Ow.
! Homer, this is your physician, DoctorJulius Hibbert.
Can you tell us what it's like in there? Um, it's like, uh- Did anyone see the movie Tron? - No.
- No.
- No.
- No.
- No.
- No.
- No.
- No.
- No.
- No.
- No.
- Yes.
Er, um, I mean, no.
No.
Well, where's my dad? Well, it should be obvious to even the most dimwitted individual who holds an advanced degree in hyperbolic topology that Homer Simpson has stumbled into the third dimension.
Sorry.
Here is an ordinary square.
Whoa! Whoa! Slow down, egghead.
But suppose we extend the square beyond the two dimensions of our universe along the hypothetical "Z" axis there.
This forms a three-dimensional object known as a cube or a "Frinkahedron," in honor of its discoverer.
Help me.
! Are you helping me? Or are you going on and on? Oh, right.
And, of course, within we find the doomed individual.
Enough of your borax, Poindexter! A man's life is at stake! We need action! Take that, you lousy dimension! Huh? Huh? Oh, there's so much I don't know about astrophysics.
I wish I read that book by that wheelchair guy.
I'll save Homer! All I needs is four stout men to work the bellows.
No, Pops.
It's too risky.
For all we know, there could be cubes in there the size of gorillas and other large- Help.
! I don't have much time.
! That does it! I'm going in! Bart, no! Cool, man! I'm gonna be sucked into a black hole! I'm gonna be sucked into oblivion! And what's gonna become of me on the other side? I don't know! I'll save you, Dad.
I can't get any closer.
You'll have to jump! Piece of cake, son.
Crap! Crap! Crap! Crap! Crap! Crap! Crap! Crap! Crap! Crap! Bart, what happened? Well, we hit a little snag when the universe sort of collapsed on itself.
But Dad seemed cautiously optimistic.
Cra-a-a-ap.
! Homie.
Be strong, Marge.
I'm sure he's gone to a better place.
D'oh.
! Eew! This is the worst place yet.
Oh, my god! Look at the- Ooh! Erotic cakes.

The Simpsons D'oh! Come on, Simpson.
Open up.
We know you're in there.
Mmm.
That one.
Someone's in here.
No.
! No! No! Oh! - Oh, for the love of- - Boy.
I've never seen a man so desperate to get out of five minutes of calisthenics.
One, two, three, four.
Up, down, three, four.
This new exercise program is great.
Yeah.
Every muscle in my body's gettin' a workout.
Especially my big fat mouth.
Yeah, especially your big fat- Oh, wait.
Raise your right hock.
Aerate.
Raise your left hock.
Aerate.
I want to see more Teddy Roosevelts and less Franklin Roosevelts.
Two! Uh, actually, Homer, that's just one.
See, each pushup includes both an up part and a down part.
D'oh! Hey, where's Charlie? How'd he get outta this? Aw, he's at home on disability.
He got injured on the job, and they sent him home with pay.
It's like a lottery that rewards stupidity.
It's like a lottery that rewards stupidity.
Stupidity, eh? Must hurt self.
Must hurt self.
D'oh! Hmm.
Probably better that didn't hit me.
- Yes? - Hello.
May I help you? Uh could you give me a little push in the opposite direction? Okay.
Thank you.
Carpal tunnel syndrome? No.
Lumber lung? No.
Juggler's despair? No.
Achy-breaky pelvis? No.
Oh! I'm never gonna be disabled.
I'm sick of being so healthy.
Hey, wait.
"Hyperobesity.
"If you weigh more than 300 pounds you qualify as disabled.
" - You can do it, old boy.
- Yes, I can! Yes, yes.
That's the spirit.
If you gain 61 pounds, they'll let you work at home? Yuh-huh.
That's the deal.
No more exercise program.
No more traffic.
No more blood drives or charity walks.
Dad, I know we don't do a lot together but helping you gain 61 pounds is something I want to be a part of.
Dad! I must protest.
You're abusing a program intended to help the unfortunate.
I'm not saying it isn't sleazy, honey.
But try to see it my way.
All my life, I've been an obese man trapped inside a fat man's body.
- Have you told Mom about this? - No.
It would only worry her.
If you want to add to her worries, go ahead.
I guess I'm just a little more grateful for all she's done for us.
- Dad! - Yes, sweetheart? Obesity is really unhealthy.
Any doctor will tell you that.
Oh, yeah? Well, we'll just see about that, little Miss Smart Guy.
My God! That's monstrous.
I've never heard of anything so negligen- I'll have no part of it.
- Can you recommend a doctor who will? - Yes.
Hi, everybody! Hi, Dr.
Nick! Now, there are many options available for dangerously underweight individuals like yourself.
I recommend a slow, steady gorging process combined with assal horizontology.
Of course.
You'll want to focus on the neglected food groups such as the whipped group, the congealed group and the chocotastic.
What can I do to speed the whole thing up, Doctor? Ah, be creative.
Instead of making sandwiches with bread, use Pop-Tarts.
Instead of chewing gum, chew bacon.
You could brush your teeth with milk shakes.
Hey, did you go to Hollywood Upstairs Medical College too? And remember, if you're not sure about something rub it against a piece of paper.
If the paper turns clear, it's your window to weight gain.
Bye-bye, everybody! Oh, it's a dream come true, boy.
I can- Nay, I must eat everything I've always wanted.
Now, come on.
Every second I'm out of bed I'm burning precious calories.
Now get grabbin'.
Eat around the banana, Dad.
It's just empty vitamins.
Lucky for you, this stuff doesn't work.
I don't know.
Fish sandwich.
Are you sure? Oh! 225? That means I lost weight! Homer.
You're, uh, on the towel rack.
Whoo-hoo! Four more pounds, and my dream comes true.
Working at home.
Here's your lemonade, and here's your beer.
Oh! You're such a vigorous young go-getter.
When's your next coffee break? Anytime I want.
- Oh.
- Hey, Flanders.
- Bad day at the rat races? - Yeah.
A crazy guy shot a bunch of people, and a subway ran over my hat.
Hey, Lise.
Come look at this.
Neat.
Homer! Whoa! - Hello, honey.
- Hi.
Um, there's something I've been meaning to ask you.
Did you put on a little weight this week? I was going to surprise you, but what the heck.
Honey, I'm purposely gaining 61 pounds to get on disability.
Have you lost your mind? Have you thought about your health or your appearance? Oh.
So that's it, isn't it, Marge? Looks.
I didn't know you were so shallow.
Oh, please! I would love you if you weighed 1,000 pounds.
But- Beautiful.
Good night.
Oh.
! I got 15 minutes to gain a pound, or I gotta face another day at work.
Bad news, Dad.
We're out of food.
We're even out of the basic elements of food.
You ate all the tarragon, and you drank all the soy sauce.
I need a miracle.
Aw, honey.
It looks just like a real doughnut.
Dad, it says "Non-Toxic.
" Well, that's a plus.
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! I did it! Uh, Dad.
Towel rack.
Whoo-hoo-hoo! Hee-hee! Ho-ho! Oh, my.
I'm pleased to dedicate this remote work terminal.
It will allow our safety inspector here to perform his duties from home.
And so, excelsior to you, Mr.
- What's the name of this gastropod? Simpson, sir.
One of your chair-moisteners from Sector 7G.
Yes! Simpson! Thank you for your pity.
Mom, are you ever planning to step in and put a stop to this? Normally, your father's crackpot schemes fizzle out as soon as he finds something good on TV.
But this season- I'm looking for something loose and billowy something comfortable for my first day of work.
Work, huh? Let me guess.
Computer programmer? - Computer magazine columnist.
Something with computers.
- Well, I use a computer.
What's the connection? Must be the nonstop sitting and snacking.
Well, sir.
Many of our clients find pants confining so we offer a range of alternatives for the ample gentleman.
Ponchos, muumuus, capes, jumpsuits unisheets, muslin body rolls, academic andjudicial robes.
I don't wanna look like a weirdo.
I'll just go with a muumuu.
Arnie Pie in the Sky with the morning commute.
Traffic this morning is as bad as it gets.
Due to a fire at the army testing lab a bunch of escaped, infected monkeys are roaming the expressway.
Despite the sweltering heat, don't unroll your windows 'cause those monkeys seem confused and irritable.
Hee-hee-hee! I pity those poor suckers on the freeway.
Gas, brake, honk.
Gas, brake, honk.
Honk, honk, punch.
Gas, gas, gas.
First time I've ever been early for work- except for all those daylight savings days.
Lousy farmers.
"To start, press any key.
" Where's the "Any" key? I see "Esk," "Catarol," and "Pig Up.
" There doesn't seem to be any "Any" key.
Whew! All this computer hacking is making me thirsty.
I think I'll order a Tab.
Oop.
No time for that now.
The computer's starting.
"Check core temperature? Yes/No.
" Yes.
"Core temperature normal.
" Hmm.
Not too shabby.
"Vent radioactive gas?" N-O.
"Venting prevents explo-si-on.
" Ooh, this is hard.
Where's my Tab? Okay, then.
Yes.
Vent the stupid gas.
Aw, no! The corn! Paul Newman's gonna have my legs broke.
Bart and Lisa have to go to school while I get to stay home.
Nyah-nyah-nyah, nyah-nyah-nyah.
- I like school.
- Why don't you live in it then? - I would if I could.
- Not me, sister.
When I grow up, I wanna be a lardo on workmen's comp just like Dad.
I wash myself with a rag on a stick.
- Whoo-ooh-ooh.
- Euw! Mom! This whole thing is really creepy.
Are you sure you won't talk to Dad? I'd like to, honey, but I'm not sure how.
Your father can be surprisingly sensitive.
Remember when I giggled at his Sherlock Holmes hat? He sulked for a week and then closed his detective agency.
Maybe you'll have to hurt his feelings.
The longer he lives like this, the harder it'll be to go back.
You're right.
Hmm.
Maybe if I use my least-nagging tone of voice- Homer.
Mmm.
Homer! Homer? That's it.
That's the one.
All right.
Send him on in.
- Dad? - Yes, honey? - Um, Mom just baked a cake.
- Ooh! Hmm? Homer, we need to have a serious talk.
You dragged me all the way from work for that? Let's quietly and calmly discuss the pros and cons of your controversial plan, shall we? - I- - Con: You're endangering your health.
Pro: I'm drought and famine resistant.
Con: You're setting a bad example for the children.
Pro: I, uh, don't have to go to work.
Con: You're running the air conditioner nonstop.
It's freezing in here.
Pro: Uh- Uh, I love you.
Con: I'm finding myself less attracted to you physically.
- Marge, this is everything I've ever dreamed of- right here.
And nobody's gonna take it away from me.
You never had faith in me before, but let me tell you- the slim, lazy Homer you knew is dead.
Now I'm a big, fat dynamo! And where's that cake? - There's no cake.
- Oh.
"Vent radioactive gas?" Y-E-S.
"Sound alertness horn?" Y-E-S.
"Decalcify calcium ducts?" Well, give me a "Y.
" Give me a- Hey.
All I have to type is "Y.
" Hey, Miss Doesn't Find Me Attractive Sexually Anymore.
- I just tripled my productivity.
- Good.
Good for you.
"Y.
" "Y.
" So many letters to choose from.
I'll pick "Y.
" "Y.
" "Y.
" What the heck are you doin' over there? There! You found the floor.
"Y.
" "Y.
" "Y.
" "Y.
" "Y.
" "Y.
" I'm going out.
I run errands during the day.
Could you pick me up a lemonade and a beer? The mail! The mail is here! Ooh! "An urgent plea from Edward James Olmos.
" "Lisa Simpson, can you afford to miss another issue of the Utne Reader?" Kids.
Free sample of fabric softener? Whoo-hoo! Mmm! I can feel three kinds of softness.
Dad, what are you doing down there? Washin' my "fat guy" hat, honey.
- We now return to Search for the Sun.
Accordin' to Daddy's will I inherit the entire plantation.
I'll see to it you don't get apricot one.
Uh, what's your dad's job again? He's a nuclear-safety technician.
What's he doin' with that broom? Uh, what isn't he doing? I heard that guy's ass has its own congressman.
Hey! Leave my dad alone.
Just because he's overweight doesn't mean he's bad.
He's a sweet man, and he has real feelings.
What are you kids lookin' at? Hey, look.
He's tryin' to get up to yell at us.
Don't make me close that shade! Hey, Homer.
You promised Mom you wouldn't wear your dress outside.
Nuts to that.
I'm goin' to the movies.
- Shouldn't you be working? - I got someone to cover for me.
- One for Honk, please.
- Oh, gee.
Uh, just a minute.
I have to check with the manager.
That overweight guy wants to see the movie.
I'm terribly sorry, sir.
I'm afraid our facilities are not equipped to meet your needs.
- What are you talking about? - What I'm saying, sir, is that a man of your carriage couldn't possibly fit in our seats.
- I could sit in the aisle.
- I'm afraid that would violate the fire code.
Hey, fatty.
! I got a movie for ya.
A Fridge Too Far.
Shame on all of you.
Give me my dignity.
I just came here to see Honk If You're Horny.
! in peace.
Sir, if you just quiet down I'd be happy to treat you to a garbage bag full of popcorn.
Oh! This may surprise you, but you can't buy me off with food.
I'm sick of all your stereotypes and cheap jokes.
The overweight individuals in this country are just as smart and talented and hardworking as everybody else.
And they're gonna make their voices heard.
All they need is a leader! I'll work harder than ever before and show the world overweight people aren't undisciplined lazy and irresponsible.
What happened to my bird? Oh! Marge? Lisa? Flanders? "Explosion imminent.
" Oh, my God.
! The plant's gonna explode.
! - Hey, that thing's going caca-cuckoo.
- Who cares? It's Homer's problem.
Wait.
I know.
Vent gas.
"Pressure too high"? Oh! "Tank must be shut down manually"? Aw! Stupid bird! I never should have put you in charge! Why, you- Oh, who am I kidding? It's all my fault.
I gotta call the plant and warn 'em.
- The fingers you have used to dial are too fat.
To obtain a special dialing wand please mash the keypad with your palm now.
I'm gonna have to shut it down myself! Fat, don't fail me now.
! D'oh.
! You gotta slow your car down and let me in because I'm a big fat guy and I can't go anywhere.
Because there's gonna be some poison gas.
There's gonna be really poison gas.
Everybody's gonna be dead, especially me! D'oh! The ice-cream man.
You gotta let me in your car and drive me- Take anything you want, man! Take it all! Push out the jive.
Bring in the love.
I heard your dad went into a restaurant and ate everything in the restaurant and they had to close the restaurant.
My dad may have gained a little weight but he's not some kind of food-crazed maniac.
Ah! Oh! That's raspberry.
Oh.
Ice cream! Ice cream! Workers, please.
There'll be time for the frozen-pudding wagon later.
You still owe me - Ten, ha-ya-yah.
- Uh! - And nine, ha-ya-yah.
- Uh! Get away, damn it! Run for your lives! - I'll take a rocket bomb! - What can I get for 30 cents? Let go! I gotta get to the tank! Heck, I can't decide without the pictures.
Six, ha-ya-yah.
Oh! Four, ha-ya-yah.
Three, ha-ya-yah.
Two, ha-ya-yah.
Stupid switch! I wish I had my reaching broom.
One, ha-ya-yah.
Wait a minute.
There's probably a- Homer, your bravery and quick thinking have turned a potential Chernobyl into a mere Three Mile Island.
Bravo.
I think it's ironic that Dad saved the day while a slimmer man would have fallen to his death.
And I think it's ironic that, for once, Dad's butt - prevented the release of toxic gas- - Bart! We'll have you out of there as soon as our tech boys get you decontaminated.
Thank you, Mr.
Burns.
It was pretty scary up there, but- For a while, I feared for my life.
Now, Homer, if there's anything else I can do for you please don't hesitate to ask.
Mr.
Burns, can you make me thin again? I guarantee it.
One.
One.
One! Bah! I'll just pay for the blasted liposuction.
Whoo-hoo! Shh!

The Simpsons D'oh! Here's your caption, boys.
"Local Hero Shuns Spotlight and Pitches In.
" What an angle! I can't believe I'm spending my Saturday picking up garbage.
I mean, half these bottles ain't even mine.
Let's have less conversation and more sanitation.
Hey, where's Homer? How'd he get out of this? Hey, everybody.
! Up here.
! Simpson, stop frolicking and get to work.
Right away, Mr.
Smithers.
I'll just walk across these slippery rock- Oh, no! He's going over the falls! Oh, good.
He snagged that tree branch.
Oh, no! The branch broke off.
Oh, good.
He can grab onto them pointy rocks.
Oh, no.
Them rocks broke his arms and legs! Oh, good.
Those helpful beavers are swimming out to save him.
Oh, no.
They're biting him and stealing his pants.
Good lord.
! He'll be sucked into the turbine.
Smithers, who was that corpse? Homer Simpson, sir.
One of the finest, bravest men ever to grace Sector 7G.
I'll cross him off the list.
That dummy worked like a charm, Dad.
Best 600 bucks I ever spent.
Come on, boy.
We've earned this Saturday.
Now let's make the most of it! Sixty-one.
Sixty-two.
Sixty-three.
Marge, we can't tell you how sorry we are.
You have our deepest condol-diddly-olences.
I'm sorry.
I-I'm just nervous.
I didn't mean any disrespect.
- What are you talking about? - You know.
Uh- Homer's passing.
Away.
- Into death.
- What? That's ridiculous.
Homer's not dead.
He's right out back in the hammock.
Oh, Marge.
Of course Homer's alive.
He's alive in all our hearts.
Yes, Marge.
I can see him.
Hi, everybody! Marge, I'm gonna give you the card of our juvenile counselor.
A tombstone? It came with the burial plot.
But that's not important.
The important thing is Homer is dead.
We've been saving for this since your wedding day.
Get out of here, you ghouls! Ayayayaya.
! Hmm? Uh, excuse me.
Sir? I think there's been a mistake.
Oh, no.
No mistake.
Your electricity's in the name of HomerJ.
Simpson, deceased.
The juice stays off till you get a job or a generator.
Oh, and, uh, my deepest sympathies.
- Homer.
- That's my name.
When I asked you if that dummy was to fake your own death, you told me no.
You go downtown first thing in the morning and straighten this out.
Mom! Dad! Bart ran into a door frame and bit his tongue! What the hell is going on here? Listen here! My name is HomerJ.
Simpson! You guys think I'm dead, but I'm not.
I want you to straighten this out without a lot - of your bureaucratic red tape and mumbo jumbo! - Okay, Mr.
Simpson.
I'll just make the change here.
And you're all set.
I don't like your attitude, you watercooler dictator.
What do you have in that secret government file anyway? I have a right to read it.
You sure do.
"Wife: Marjorie.
Children: Bartholomew, Lisa"- Aha! See? This thing is all screwed up! Who the heck is Margaret Simpson? - Uh, your youngest daughter.
- "Uh, your youngest daughter.
" Well, how about this? This thing says my mother's still alive! She died when I was a kid! See that stone angel up there? That's my mother's grave! My dad points it out every time we drive by.
Mr.
Simpson, uh, maybe you should actually go up there.
Huh? Oh, Mom.
I'm sorry I never come to see you.
I'm just not a cemetery person.
"Here lies"- Walt Whitman? Damn you, Walt Whitman! I hate you, Walt freakin' Whitman! Leaves of Grass my ass! Wait a minute.
Maybe it's that other grave.
The one that says "Simpson.
" Oh! Why does my death keep coming back to haunt me? Oh! You awful, awful man! - Get out of my son's grave! - I hate to rain on your parade, lady.
But this is my grave.
Hey-Wait a minute! - Mom? - Homer? - I thought you were dead.
- I thought you were dead.
Well, dang blast it! Isn't anybody in this dad-gummed cemetery dead? I didn't want to cause a fuss, but now that you mention it.
Oh.
Homer, you grew up so handsome.
Some people say I look like Dan Aykroyd.
I can't believe you're here.
Dad always told me you died while I was at the movies.
Oh! Oh, my poor baby.
You must've been so upset.
But I suppose Abe had his reasons.
Yeah.
Well, where have you been all this time? Oh, it's a very complicated story.
Let's just enjoy this moment.
Mom, there's something you should know about me.
I almost always spoil the moment.
- I'm sorry.
- That's okay, darling.
It wasn't your fault.
Hey, everybody! I got a big surprise for you! Presenting my mother! - You're kidding! - That's Grandma Simpson? - Can you believe it? - I thought she was- - Hello.
- This is so weird.
It's like something out of Dickens.
Or Melrose Place.
Where have you been, Granny? They freeze you or something? Oh, my! Such clever grandchildren.
So full of questions and bright, shiny eyes.
I don't know what to say.
I finally have a mother-in-law.
No more living vicariously through my girlfriends.
Hey! Since you were a no-show at all the big moments of my life you owe me years of back presents! Christmases, birthdays, Easters, Kwanzaas, good report cards.
Hmm, 75 bucks a pop plus interest and penalties.
You owe me $22,000.
I'll Kwanzaa you.
! Homer, don't be so hard on little- What is his name? This is my room.
This is my dresser.
It's where I keep my shirts when I'm not wearing them.
Oh, yes.
Right in the drawers.
You remembered.
Oh, I've missed moments like this Mom.
I saw all your awards, Lisa.
They're mighty impressive.
Aw, I just keep 'em out to bug Bart.
Don't be bashful.
When I was your age kids made fun of me because I read at the ninth-grade level.
- Me too! - Hey, Mom! Look at me! Look at what I can do! I see you, Homer.
That's very nice.
Although, I hardly consider A Separate Peace the ninth-grade level.
Yeah, more like preschool.
- I hateJohn Knowles.
- Me too.
Mom, you're not looking! You know, Lisa, I feel like I have an instant rapport with you.
You didn't dumb it down.
You said "rapport.
" Gotta run! Grandma stuff! Huh? There.
Now no one should be able to hear us.
- What? - All right.
We don't need the dryer.
- What? - Just shut up and listen! There's something fishy about Grandma.
Whenever we ask her where she's been all this time, she changes the subject.
And just now when a police car drove by, she ran into the house.
Yeah, I don't trust her either.
I was going through her purse.
Look what I found.
"Mona Simpson.
Mona Stevens.
"Martha Stewart.
Penelope Olsen.
Muddy Mae Suggins?" These are the calling cards of a con artist.
Woo-hoo! I'm so glad to have my mom back.
I never realized how much I missed her.
- She's nice.
- But? I just don't think you should get too excited about the woman who abandoned you for 25 years.
- You could get hurt again.
- First, it wasn't 25 years.
It was 27 years.
And second, she had a very good reason.
- Which was? - I don't know.
I guess I was just a horrible son and no mother would want me.
Oh, Homie.
Come on! You're a sweet, kind, loving man.
I'm sure you were a wonderful son.
- Then why did she leave me? - Let's find out.
Mother Simpson, we'd like to ask you a few questions about your past.
Can't reminisce.
Sleeping.
Spill it, Muddy Mae, or we're calling the cops! - Please don't! - All right.
Then we'll call your husband.
- Grampa! - No! I'll talk! I'll tell you everything.
I've wanted to tell you.
It all started in the '60s.
Take out wrenched ankle.
Mom! Mom! Mom! Oh, my little Homie Bear.
- Time for bed.
- Sing me my bedtime song, Mom.
Mm.
Darn tootin'! Here's the tricky part.
Abe, isn't Homer cute? Probably.
I'm trying to watch the Super Bowl.
If people don't support this thing, it might not make it.
Joe Willie Namath swaggering off the field his sideburns an apogee of sculpted "sartorium"- the foppish follicles pioneered by Ambrose Burnside Appomattox, 1865.
His wild, untamed facial hair revealed a new world of rebellion, of change- - a world where doors were open for women like me.
But Abe was stuck in his button-down Plastic Fantastic Madison Avenue scene.
Look at them sideburns! He looks like a girl.
Now, Johnny Unitas- there's a haircut you could set your watch to.
So, Mother Simpson, where did your newfound sense of irresponsibility take you? I soon found people who shared my views at the state college.
Anthrax, gangrene, swimmer's ear.
Get your germ lab out of here! - Now! Now! How could I not become a radical when we were fighting a force of pure evil? Hey, hey, Mr.
Burns.
! Enough already with the germs.
Ptooh their flower power- it's no match for my glower power.
Well, that's some nice glowering, Mr.
"B.
" We'd met the enemy, and it was Montgomery Burns.
Drastic action had to be taken to stop his war machine.
I put Homer to bed, Abe.
And now I'm going out.
- It could be a late night.
I'm meeting my destiny.
- So long.
When this baby goes off, Burns's lab is gonna be history, man! Germ history! Oh, man! I got the munchies.
Oh! No! Wait a minute.
Bronchial tubes clearing.
Asthma disappearing.
Acne remains.
But asthma disappearing.
My germs! My precious germs! They never harmed a soul.
They never even had a chance.
Whoever did this will never get past me.
You poor man.
Let me help you up.
You just made a very big mistake.
You'll spend the rest of your life in pri- My asthma's gone! Listen to me breathe.
From that moment on, my life as I knew it was over.
Only one member of the Springfield Seven was identified.
She's been described as a woman in her early 30s yellow complexion and may be extremely helpful.
For Channel 6 News, I'm Kenny Brockelstein.
Homer.
I'll miss you, Homer.
I thought I dreamed that kiss.
I'm so sorry I misjudged you, Mom.
You had to leave to protect your family.
- How did you survive? - Oh, I had help from my friends in the underground.
Jerry Rubin gave me a job marketing his line of health shakes I proofread Bobby Seale's cookbook and I ran credit checks at Tom Hayden's Porsche dealership.
Wait a minute.
There's one thing I don't understand.
In all those years, why didn't you ever try to contact me? But I did.
I sent you a care package every week.
Oh, come on, Mom.
We use that same line on the kids when they're at camp.
But I did.
I really did.
I'll prove it to you.
- Any undelivered mail for HomerJ.
Simpson? - No.
Oh, wait.
This.
That's what happens when you don't tip your letter carrier at Christmas.
Yes, I'd like to send this letter to the Prussian consulate in Siam by aeromail.
Am I too late for the 4:30 autogiro? - Um, better look in the manual.
- Ignorance.
Wait a minute.
I know that woman.
But from when? And in what capacity? It's her.
! - At last! - This book must be out of date.
I don't see Prussia, Siam or autogiro.
Keep looking! Are you sure this is the woman you saw in the post office? Absolutely.
Who could forget such a monstrous visage? She has the sloping brow and cranial bumpage of the career criminal.
Uh, sir, phrenology was dismissed as quackery 160 years ago.
Of course you'd say that.
You have the brainpan of a stagecoach tilter.
At any rate, the F.
B.
I.
will track down this mystery woman and put her behind bars.
- How does it happen, Joe? - How does what happen? How does a sweet young lady mortgage her future for a bunch of scraggly ideals and greasy-haired promises? Maybe she thought the war in Southeast Asia was so immoral her end justified the means.
Gee, Joe.
You haven't been the same since your son went crazy in Vietnam.
It's a pain that never ends.
- Seven! - No, Dad.
It's a rhetorical question.
Rhetorical, eh? - Eight! - Dad, do you even know what "rhetorical" means? Do I know what rhetorical means? Quick, Grandma! Hide! No door is gonna keep me from my meddlin'! Stand up straight, Bart.
Abe? What the- Now, here's a piece of bad news.
Oh, Abe! You've aged terribly.
What do you expect? You left me to raise the boy on my own! I had to leave! But you didn't have to tell Homer I was dead! It was either that or tell him his mother was a wanted criminal! You were a rotten wife, and I'll never ever forgive you! Can we have sex? Please? - Oh, Abe! - Well, I tried.
What's for supper? Yeah.
I might've seen her.
It's hard to tell from this old picture, you know? Well, according to our computer-aging program she should look about Yeah, I seen her.
Uh, that is to say, I saw her.
Look at me, Grandma.
I'm a hippie.
Peace, man.
Groovy.
Bomb Vietnam! Four more years! Up with people! You know, Grandma, I used to think maybe I was adopted.
I couldn't understand how I fit into this family.
Now that I've met you, I suddenly make a lot of sense.
I'm so glad to see the spirit of the '60s is still alive in you kids.
Yep.
I saw her.
That is to say, I seen her.
She seemed like a nice lady.
Well, that nice lady set the cause of biological warfare back 30 years.
We're only now finally caught up.
Two more ladies come by earlier that day.
One was real pretty.
Tother, sort of plain.
Ma'am, we're gonna need your assistance in locating this individual.
You're fresh.
Don't you want to play "good cop, bad cop"? - Ma'am, we're all good cops.
- I had no intention of playing the good cop.
Look, we know you bought the tombstone.
We know the fugitive visited that tombstone.
Whose tombstone was it? Just lift up your coffee cups and see.
- Good lord! - Put out an A.
P.
B on a Uosdwis R.
Dewoh.
Uh, better start with Greek town.
That's HomerJ.
Simpson, Chief.
You're reading it upside down.
Uh, cancel that A.
P.
B.
But, uh- Oh, bring back some of them, uh, gyros.
Uh, Chief, you're talking into your wallet.
Grandma, have you ever thought about moving back to Springfield? You could live with Grampa again.
Oh, I'm a living joke.
You know, Lisa it might be nice to rest for a while.
Mom, there's nothing to be alarmed about.
But could you take one last look at the family and join me in the kitchen? I've been waiting Huh? I'm sorry, sir.
I must've taped over that.
Freeze! F.
B.
I.
The jig is up.
All right, I admit it.
I am the Lindbergh baby.
Waah! Waah! Goo, goo.
I miss my fly-fly dada.
Are you trying to stall us, or are you just senile? A little from column "A," a little from column "B.
" Sir, she's gone! - We made it, Homer! - It's all thanks to our anonymous tipster.
But who are you? And why did you tip us off? Well, it's 'cause of your old lady that I got rid of the asthma - that was keeping me out of the academy.
- Thanks.
Sure.
Just think of me as an anonymous friend who rose through the ranks of the Springfield Police to become Chief Clancy Wig- Yak, yak.
Yak, yak, yak.
Well, there's my ride.
The underground awaits.
At least this time I'm awake for your good-bye.
Oh, Homer.
Remember, whatever happens, you have a mother and she's truly proud of you.
Oh.
! Hurry up, man.
! This electric van only has 20 minutes of juice left! - Don't forget me! - Don't worry, Homer.
You'll always be a part of me.
D'oh! Shh!
The Simpsons D'oh! I'd like to thank everybody who contributed to Krusty's Canned Food Drive.
Your generous donations have made this our slipperiest, slimiest slobstacle course ever! Our contestants will drop out of my nose and blurp into a tub of refried beans.
From there, they'll stumble down a sluice of rich, eggy bÃ©arnaise sauce.
- How can we afford it? It's rancid! - Uhh- And at the finish line a scrumptious parfait of pudding, pickle brine and detergent where a writhing pile of kids will grope blindly for hot dogs! Krusty, please! It burns! Oh, just think, Lise.
That's our pickle brine burning Sideshow Mel.
That Sideshow Mel thinks he's so big.
Whatever happened to Sideshow Bob? Don't you remember, Dad? He framed Krusty, he tried to kill Aunt Selma he rigged an election- And he tried to murder me.
! Oh, yeah.
But what I'll mainly remember is the laughter.
I wonder what he's doing now.
Ah, Westminster Abbey.
Edward the Confessor himself could not have done better.
Now to set the clocks to Greenwich mean time.
My dear abbey! This is the way we mop the floor, mop the floor mop the floor Oh, must you bray night and day at that infernal television? - Oh, look who's talking.
- Yeah, Bob.
You used to be on this show.
Don't remind me! My foolish capering destroyed more young minds than syphilis and pinball combined.
Oh, how I loathe that box that omnidirectional sludge pump droning and burping- Look here! That's enough now! I own 60% of that network! All right, break it up, boys.
It's time for work detail.
I suppose you don't like tabloid newspapers either.
There.
That's the last condom wrapper.
Oh, I renew my objection to this pointless endeavor.
Informally now and by affidavit later, time permitting.
Shut your word-hole! We gotta get this place clean for the air show.
Air show? Buzz-cut Alabamians spewing colored smoke from their whizz jets to the strains of "Rock You Like a Hurricane"? What kind of country-fried rube is still impressed by that? - Yeah! - Yeah.
I want to meet the first female stealth bomber pilot.
During the Gulf War, she destroyed I want to see some birds get sucked into the engines, rare ones.
- This year I'm making ear plugs out of biscuit dough.
They're ready.
So weary.
Grandma, this is my friend, Craig.
Friend? You mean you two aren't knocking boots? Ever do the back-seat mambo, Craigie? I know that voice.
TV's bottomless chum bucket has claimed Vanessa Redgrave! Now I'm gonna haul ass to Lollapalooza.
Yee-haw.
! Farewell, dear 'Nessa.
Hey, you.
! The state's not paying you five cents an hour to stand around.
- Now, get busy! - Oh, I'll get busy.
I'll get very busy, indeed.
You still got it, Bob.
Way to guard the parking lot, Top Gun! I have three medals for this.
Hey! Where is Sideshow Bob and that guy who, uh, eats people and takes their faces? - I'm right here, Chief.
- Oh.
Then where's Sideshow Bob? - Uh, he ran off.
- Oh, great.
Well, if anyone asks, uh, I beat him to death, okay? Right.
At this point in time, I would like to direct your attention to the particular air vehicle next to which I am currently standing.
The Harrier jet is one of our more dollar-intensive, ordnance-delivery vectors.
Five tires? Am I seeing things? Uh, and although it looks complicated it's so well-designed, even a child could fly it.
- Can I fly it? - Of course you cannot.
Free Duff? Viva life! Mm.
Uhh- Take that, Mom! Take that, Dad! Send me to a psychiatrist, will you? Take that, Dr.
Sally Waxler! Uh, Colonel, they're expecting you at the podium in 10 minutes.
I'm, uh- Hmm.
What in the World According to Garp? Those are my dress towels! Who's in my private washroom? McGuckett, let me in.
- The door already is closed.
- What? This is Colonel Leslie "Hap" Hapablap.
If you don't open that door, I'll tear you up like a Kleenex at a snot party! You say you're in the military? Sweet Enola Gay, son! I'm gonna come in there and corpse you up! Corpse you up and mail you to mama! Well, where'd he go? Oh, got my knuckles all lined up for nothing.
Sorry, ladies.
- Look at that hunk of junk.
- Not jun- You're ignorant! That's the Wright Brothers' plane.
At Kitty Hawk in 1903 Charles Lindbergh flew it 15 miles on a thimbleful of corn oil.
Single-handedly won us the Civil War, it did.
So, how do you know so much about American history? I pieced it together mostly from sugar packets.
Authorization code? Code? Son, this is Colonel Hapablap! That fool McGuckett sprayed runway foam all over Chuck Yeager's Acura.
Now get down there with the chamois triple-time! - But, Colonel, I'm under strict orders to- - Sweet Enola Gay, son! Get moving or I'll tear you up like a Kleenex at a, uh, snot party.
Sir, right away, sir! They didn't have any aspirin, so I got you some cigarettes.
Maybe my headache will go away once the show starts.
Uh, ladies and gentlemen what a day for an air show! Not a cloud in the sky.
! Except perhaps a mushroom cloud.
Oh, forget it.
To slip the surly bonds of Earth and touch the face of God.
To fly! The dream of man and flightless bird alike.
And now, hold on tight as we blast through the thrilling highlights of aviation history! - Say! Did somebody say box kites? - No.
! The common box kite was originally used as a means of drying wet string.
Do they have to play that rock music? Every note is pounding into my skull.
Anybody out there feel the need for speed? - Yay! - Yay.
Then get ready for the pride of the United States Air Force! The British-made HarrierJump jet! Dad, why aren't you looking? Why jerk my neck around like a goon when Tyranno-Vision decides what I should look at? Ooh, look! It's Maggie! Uh, Maggie? Sideshow Bob! Hello, Springfield.
Sorry to divert your attention from all the big noises and shiny things.
But something's been troubling me lately- television! Wouldn't our lives be so much richer if television were done away with? - What? - Surely he's not talking about VH1? Why, we could revive the lost arts of conversation and scrimshaw.
Thus I submit to you, we abolish television permanently! Go back to Massachusetts, pinko! Oh, and one more thing.
I've stolen a nuclear weapon.
If you do not rid this city of television within two hours I will detonate it.
Farewell.
By the way, I'm aware of the irony of appearing on TV in order to decry it.
So don't bother pointing that out.
Kids, everything's gonna be okay! Don't panic! Just don't panic! Mom! Mom, you're stepping on my heels and knocking my shoes off! We can always get more shoes.
Move, move, move! Stamp your hand for reentry.
Hey! Cool! I want to be around when those guns start going off.
Bart! No! - Wait! Wait! My children are in there! - You must be very proud, ma'am.
Our city will not negotiate with terrorists.
Is there a city nearby that will? No need, sir.
We'll find that head case faster than Garfield finds lasagna.
Oh.
I'm sorry.
My- My wife thought that was gangbusters.
This elevator only goes to the basement.
And someone made an awful mess down there.
Watch out.
! He's got his probe.
! Bart! Bart! What are you doing? We've got to get out of here! Target sighted! Launching air-to-nerd missile! Ow! Come on! Mom and Dad are waiting! Bob is not here.
We have searched every square inch of this base and all we have found is porno, porno, porno! We have only 20 minutes left.
Send in the esteemed representatives of television.
Hey, hey! Now, this is my kind of meeting! Gentlemen, it's time we face up to the un-face-up-to-able.
We must sacrifice television in order to save the lives of our townspeople.
Whoa! Whoa-ho-ho! Let's not go nuts! Would it really be worth living in a world without television? I think the survivors would envy the dead.
- I appreciate your passion on behalf of your medium.
But I'm afraid we're out of options.
Television must go.
May God have mercy on our souls.
And as my final newscast draws to a close I'm reminded of a few of the events that brought me closer to you.
The collapse of the Soviet Union, premium ice cream price wars dogs that were mistakenly issued major credit cards and others who weren't so lucky.
And so, farewell.
Uh, and, uh, don't forget to look for my new column in PC World magazine.
Success! They're giving in! Blast! I should have made more demands! Some decent local marmalade, for one.
Oh, well, next time.
Not my extendo-glove! Oh, they haven't made those since the war.
Not- Oh, not my Paris backdrop! How am I gonna make fun of the Frogs? Wait.
If I could only stay on the air I'd have 100% of the audience.
Think of the ratings.
Okay, so we can't go over the fence.
I feel so helpless.
What if something happens to them? I'm sure they're fine, honey.
Hmm.
Well, at least they're wearing clean underwear.
Free and easy, Lise.
There's nothing like an unfurnished basement for pure comfort.
Huh? Hurry up.
Mom and Dad are probably worried sick.
Do you know what really frosts my Kelvinator? That fruitcup's probably still laughing at us from his damn hidey-hole.
I'd rather take an order from Bill Clinton than hear that guy's snooty, high-toned voice again, sir.
"High-toned voice.
" Bart, that's it.
I know where Sideshow Bob is hiding.
When Bob broadcast that message, his voice was higher than normal.
And what makes your voice high? - Tight, binding underwear? - Helium! Sideshow Bob is in the Duff blimp! All Springfield trembles before the might of Sideshow Bob.
Blasted helium! Shoo! Shoo! Shoo! Shoo! That's better.
Gone.
Gone too.
Fabulous.
Marvelous.
This is the emergency broadcast system.
Stand by for an urgent bulletin.
Hey, hey! Krusty the Clown is back on the air! Eight- No, no! Twelve hours a day! The only game in town! Krusty! But how? Coming at you live from the civil defense shack in the remote Alkali Flats of the Springfield badlands.
I'll be beaming out Hour after hour of unscripted, unrehearsed comedy featuring, uh, you know, uh, Professor Gas Can! Uh, and, uh, former president, Ike Eisenhower! Let's get busy! Oh! My utopia lies in ruins.
How naive of me to think a mere atom bomb could fell the chattering Cyclops! Well, at least I'll have my revenge! Bob, no! Don't you see? That would be taking the easy way out.
I agree.
"Best before November 1959.
" Damn it, Bob! There were plenty of brand-new bombs.
But you had to go for that retro '50s charm.
Well, if it isn't my arch nemesis, Bart Simpson and his sister, Lisa, to whom I'm fairly indifferent.
So Krusty double-crossed you.
But your basic plan was pure genius.
Where do you get your ideas? Oh, please! Let's not embarrass us both with that hoary old stall-the-villain-with-flattery scheme.
I- I should've known you were too smart to fall for that.
Really? What type of smart? Book smart? Because there are a lot of people who are book smart.
But it takes a very special type of genius to- All right, Bob.
It's over.
! Come out with your hands up.
! No! How did they find me? He's getting away! - Oh, not the Harrier! We've got a war tomorrow.
God bless the idiot-proof Air Force.
They're gone! Hell! Not the Wright Brothers' plane.
The Smithsonian's gonna have my ass on a platter.
Dad! Help! Hang on, boy! Daddy's coming to save you! D'oh! Mom! I found Sideshow Bob's hideout! And I got a secret message to the police! And I had a blimp fall on me! And I was in an atomic blast! But I'm okay now! Well, I wrecked the gate.
But you don't hear me bragging.
Now let's roll! Ah, for the days when aviation was a gentleman's pursuit.
Back before everyJoe Sweat Sock could wedge himself behind a lunch tray and jet off to Raleigh-Durham.
Are you getting lots of bugs in your mouth too? Yes.
Prepare to engage enemy.
Bogie's air speed not sufficient for intercept.
Suggest we get out and walk.
Jump, boy! I got you! I'm coming! Now you, boy.
You can't escape, Bob.
If the tennis rackets don't get you, the pool skimmers will.
Oh, I- I never planned to escape.
You see, this is a kamikaze mission.
You and I are going to kill Krusty the Clown! Kids, Itchy and Scratchy can't be here today.
But instead, we've got the next best thing.
It's The Stingy and Battery Show.
! They bite and light and bite and light and bite You know what I'm talking about.
Uh-oh.
You can't kill Krusty.
He made you what you are.
- Without him, you wouldn't even be called "Sideshow.
" What the hell is that? A lawn mower? Get out of the way, Krusty! What is the freakin' holdup? Die, Krusty! Die- Oh.
Ooh, sorry.
Uh, we don't normally drive these in the Air Force.
Gotcha! Ya TV-hatin' mutant.
What is your major malfunction, Sideshow Bob? Oh, my little sugar bun.
I'm so glad you're safe.
But- But- But- But, M-M-Mom! You're embarrassing me in front of the army guys.
How ironic.
My crusade against television has come to an end so formulaic it could have spewed from the PowerBook of the laziest Hollywood hack.
Hey, everybody! I'm gonna haul ass to Lollapalooza! - Here we go again.
- Here we go again.
Shh!

Hello, I'm Troy McClure.
You may remember me from such Fox Network specials as Alien NoseJob, and five fabulous weeks of The Chevy Chase Show.
Tonight, we're here to honor America's favorite non-prehistoric cartoon family.
You'll see long-lost footage never-before-seen material from your favorite episodes old favorites you can't see in syndication.
So join me, won't you, for "The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular!" The Simpsons D'oh! The Simpsons began as the brainchild of cartoonist Matt Groening the already-famous creator of such comics as Damnation, Johnny Reb and True Murder Stories.
In 1987, Groening teamed up with award-winning producers James L.
Brooks and Sam Simon.
And what better place to premiere their creation than on The Tracy Ullman Show- the nation's showcase for psychiatrist jokes and musical comedy numbers.
On April 19, 1987, America first met The Simpsons.
Well, good night, Son.
- Um, Dad? - Yeah? What is the mind? Is it just a system of impulses or is it something tangible? Relax.
What is mind? No matter.
What is matter? Never mind.
- Thanks, Dad.
- Good night, Son.
- Good night, Lisa.
- Good night, Mom.
- Sweet dreams.
- Thanks, Mom.
- Sleep tight.
- I will, Mom.
Don't let the bedbugs bite.
Bedbugs? Sweet dreams.
We may be the best parents in the world.
Mm.
Good night, dear.
Good night.
All right.
Climb in.
There's nothing to worry about.
Now everyone, go to sleep.
Good night.
Di-da.
They haven't changed a bit, have they? As the weeks went on, so did the cartoons.
Fresh chocolate chip cookies.
Oh! Don't touch those yet.
They're very, very hot.
Aha! No one's around.
The perfect crime.
Yow! Do I smell cookies? Where's the cookies? They're all gone, the whole batch.
Somebody ate those cookies.
Did you eat the cookies, Maggie? I think she's trying to tell us something.
- Go on, Maggie.
- Go on, Maggie.
Go! Go! There's no perfect crime.
Ohh! I've got a great idea.
Let's play Space Patrol.
! I'll be Lee Suey, the devil-may-care rocket pilot.
And Maggie can be Medina, your spunky sidekick.
And you'll be- Bartron, the evil robot from Mars gone berserk.
Do I understand you correctly, Bartron? Do you wish me to release you from the Helmet of Evil Thoughts with my enchanted space wand? - Yes! Yes! Yes! - I will do it, Bartron.
But who knows what mysterious forces will be unleashed? Oh, no.
Inside the evil Bartron is a horrible, mutant boy.
! We'll be safe here till Mom and Dad the Evil Overlords, get home.
As wacky as those kids were they were no match for Captain Wacky, later renamed "Homer.
" Wake up, everybody! It's World War III! Quick.
! Down to the fallout shelter.
! The bombs are dropping.
! Eighteen seconds.
Hmm.
If this were really a nuclear war, we'd all be dead meat by now.
Say, you're all shivering.
Are you cold or what? Bart.
! Bart.
! Time for your Sunday night bath, boy.
! Gotta hide.
Bart.
! Huh.
Where are ya, boy? - Oops.
- Aha! There ya go! Now, that's not so bad, is it? Scrub good now.
Ahh.
Welcome to zee exotic world of undersea explorer Bart Simpseau.
Come with Bart as he dive into zee briny deep searching for the wily and elusive washcloth.
Suddenly, without warning, zee brave boy get more than he bargain for.
Help! Help! Help! Help! Clean as a whistle, Homer.
Maybe the drawings were a little crude, but all the characters were there.
Itchy and Scratchy, Grampa Simpson and Krusty the Clown.
When we return, more classic moments- and, for the first time on TV our private reel of Simpsons outtakes including the alternate endings to, "Who Shot Mr.
Burns?" The cash register says, "N.
R.
A.
4ever.
" Just one of the hundreds of radical, right-wing messages inserted into every show by creator Matt Groening.
Over the six years The Simpsons has been on the air we've received dozens of letters from fans wanting to know more about the show.
Tonight, we'll answer some of your questions.
Professor Lawrence Pierce of the University of Chicago writes: "I think Homer gets stupider every year.
" That's not a question, professor.
But we'll let the viewers judge for themselves.
Hello, my name is Mr.
Burns.
- I believe you have a letter for me.
- Okay, Mr.
Burns.
- Uh, what's your first name? - I don't know.
Well, Homer, maybe you can take some consolation in the fact that something you created is making so many people happy.
"Ooh! Look at me.
I'm making people happy.
"I'm the magical man from Happy Land in a gumdrop house on Lollipop Lane.
" Oh, by the way, I was being sarcastic.
Well, duh.
Yabba-dabba-doo! Simpson, Homer Simpson He's the greatest guy in history From the town of Springfield He's about to hit a chestnut tree Hey, guys.
Look what I smuggled aboard.
Homer, no! - Huh? - They'll clog the instruments! - Careful! They're ruffled! - I'll take care of this.
Ahh- Mmm.
Ants! No TV and no beer make Homer something something.
- Go crazy? - Don't mind if I do! Dr.
Linus Irving of the Sloan-Kettering Memorial Institute writes: "How does Matt Groening find the time to write and draw an entire Simpsons episode every week?" For the answer to this, we went straight to the source.
Get outta my office! Of course, what Matt meant to say according to his attorneys, is that he couldn't possibly do it alone and he insisted that we make time to acknowledge the hard work of everyone who makes The Simpsons possible.
Ambassador Henry Mwabwetumba of the Ivory Coast writes: "What is the real deal with Mr.
Burns's assistant, Smithers? You know what I'm talking about.
" Of course we do.
- The preparations for your birthday have begun.
- I won't get what I really want.
No one does.
Happy birthday, Mr.
Smithers Mmm.
- People like dogs, Mr.
Burns.
- Nonsense.
Dogs are idiots.
Think about it, Smithers.
If I came into your house and started sniffing at your crotch and slobbering all over your face, what would you say? Mmm.
If you did it, sir? - I'll, uh, print you out a copy.
- Thanks.
Hello.
Smithers.
You're.
Quite.
Good.
At.
Turning.
Me.
On.
Um, you probably should ignore that.
Hmm.
I dreamed about her again last night, Smithers.
You know that dream where you're in bed, and they fly in through the window? Ahh.
As you can see, the real deal with Waylon Smithers is that he's Mr.
Burns's assistant.
He's in his early 40s, is unmarried, and currently resides in Springfield.
Thanks for writing.
We'll be right back.
If you said "Bleeding Gums" Murphy and Dr.
Marvin Monroe you are wrong- they were never popular.
Right about now you're probably saying "Troy, I've seen every Simpsons episode.
You can't show me anything new.
" You've got some attitude, mister.
Besides, you're wrong! Because sometimes episodes run long and certain scenes never get aired.
So, fire up your VCR, because here, for the first time ever are the cutout classics.
When Krusty the Clown got canceled- he tried everything to stay on the air.
Here's what you didn't see.
If you watch my show, I will send you this book featuring me in a variety of sexually explicit positions.
What? Oh.
Hey! It's not really me.
I used a stunt butt.
Krusty, we're from the network.
We have some bad news.
- I'm afraid your show's been canceled.
- I thought this would happen.
I just hope you replace me with something as educational and uplifting as I tried to be.
Actually, it's a hemorrhoid infomercial starring Claude Akins.
Can I play "Hemorrhoid Sufferer Number One"? - Ooh! Oh, that hurts! Aah! Oh, is there no relief? - I don't think so.
Well, how about one of the "after" guys? Ahh! Oh, that's better.
- I can ride a bike again! - Sorry.
Ohh.
When Springfield legalized gambling Homer became a blackjack dealer and comedy was "in the cards.
" Twenty.
Your move, Mr.
Bond.
I'll take a hit, dealer.
Joker.
You were supposed to take those out of the deck.
- Oh, sorry.
Here's another one.
- What is this card? - "Rules for Draw and Stud Poker?" - What a pity, Mr.
Bond.
But-Well, it was Homer's fault.
I didn't lose.
I never lose.
Well, at least tell me the details of your plot for world domination.
I'm not going to fall for that one again.
Earlier this year, Homer's long-lost mother returned and so did a long-lost care package.
Mmm.
Homer, please.
You don't have to wolf down that 25-year-old candy - just to make me happy.
- But it won't make you unhappy, right? Hey! Space food sticks! Oh, I wish I had these on my space adventure.
Did you know I was blasted into space two years ago, Mom? Oh, sure.
I read all about it.
I mean- It was national news.
Do you still work for NASA? - No, I work at the nuclear power plant.
- Oh, Homer.
Well, you'll be happy to know I don't work very hard.
Actually, I'm bringing the plant down from the inside.
When Homer sold his soul for a doughnut he found out that hell isn't all it's cracked up to be in these never-before-broadcast scenes.
Mm, lawyers, lawyers, lawyers- Ooh, Lionel Hutz! "Cases won in 30 minutes or your pizza's free.
" Hmm.
I'd sell my soul for a Formula One racing car.
That can be arranged.
Changed my mind.
Sorry.
- Cool.
- Bart, stop pestering Satan! Your Honor, we find that Homer Simpson's soul is legally the property of Marge Simpson, and not of the devil.
- Ohh.
- Yea! Whoo-hoo! Ow! Well, I didn't win.
Here's your pizza.
- But we did win.
- That's okay.
The box is empty.
If that's what they cut out, what they leave in must be pure gold! Let's watch some more of those fabulous Simpsons outtakes.
Apu living with the Simpsons? It happened.
And here's a scene you didn't see.
I'm hoping you enjoy this movie.
It made every Indian critic's Top 400 list.
This movie you rented sucks.
No, it doesn't.
It's funny.
Their clothes are different from my clothes.
Look at what they're wearin'.
A few years back, Bart was adopted by Mr.
Burns.
In this very special outtake, Homer attempts a reconciliation with his estranged son.
- Watch.
- Bart, you're coming home.
I want to stay here with Mr.
Burns.
I suggest you leave immediately.
Or what? You'll release the dogs, or the bees or the dogs with bees in their mouth and when they bark, they shoot bees at you? Well, go ahead.
Do your worst! My worst, eh? Smithers release the robotic Richard Simmons.
Come on, big boy! Shake the butter off those buns! Come on, girls.
Shake, shake, shake.
Smithers, it's out of control.
I'll take him out, sir.
His ass is gonna blow! This past summer, all of America was trying to solve the mystery of"Who Shot Mr.
Burns?" Then they found out it was the baby.
To keep this bombshell secret the producers animated several solutions that were never intended to air.
And to keep the show's animators, editors staff and hangers-on from leaking the solution two completely different endings were produced.
One real, one phony.
Here's the ending you were never meant to see.
The one who shot me was- Waylon Smithers! No-o! Wait a minute.
Yes.
With the sun-blocker in place and the town aghast, I was on top of the world.
So I wanted to kick up my heels and indulge my sweet tooth.
I feel like celebrating.
Oh, it's you.
What are you so happy about? - I see.
- Smithers had thwarted my earlier attempt to take candy from a baby, but with him out of the picture I was free to wallow in my own crapulence.
Or so I thought.
At the last moment, Smithers, drunk as a lemur lurched out of the darkness and fired.
! That's right.
Right before I shotJasper.
Hmm.
I was busy that night.
Stricken, I lurched forth in search of aid.
But finding only slack-jawed gawkers, I gave up and collapsed on the sundial.
Then, with your last ounce of strength you pointed to "W" and "S".
Waylon Smithers! I'm just relieved that Homer's safe and that you've recovered and we can all get back to normal.
Not exactly.
Smithers, for attempting to kill me I'm giving you a five percent pay cut.
Ohh! But, of course, for that ending to work you would have to ignore all the Simpson D.
N.
A.
evidence.
And that would be downright nutty.
Yes, the Simpsons have come a long way since an old drunk made humans out of his rabbit characters to pay off his gambling debts.
Who knows what adventures they'll have between now and the time the show becomes unprofitable? I'm Troy McClure, and I'll leave you with what we all came here to see: hard-core nudity! Shh!

The Simpsons D'oh! It's a Krusty Kinda Kristmas.
! Brought to you by I LG- selling your body's chemicals after you die.
And by Li'I Sweetheart Cupcakes, a subsidiary of I LG.
Oh, hi! I didn't hear you come in.
Welcome to my home.
And- Ho-ho! Say, did I hear some carolers? Hey! It's respected private citizen, Tom Landry! And South American sensation Shooshisha- Shooshashi- Shoosh- Oh, boy! Uhh! Now, stay tuned for a video Christmas card from Tupac Shakur.
Hey, I thought Krusty was Jewish.
Christmas is a time when people of all religions come together to worshipJesus Christ.
Boring! Help! You want excitement? Shove this up your stocking! Ooh-hoo-whoa! - Hmm, that looks entertaining.
- Oh, yeah! So tell your folks, "Buy me Bonestorm or go to hell!" Buy me Bonestorm or go to hell! - Bart! - Young man, in this house we use a little word called "please.
" - It's the coolest video game ever.
- I'm sorry, honey but those games cost up to, and including, $70.
And they're violent, and they distract you from your schoolwork.
Those are all good points, but the problem is they don't result in me getting the game.
I know how you feel, Bart.
When I was your age I wanted an electric football game more than anything in the world.
And my parents bought it for me, and it was the happiest day of my life.
Well, good night.
Oh, I'll never get that game.
Tuck-in time! All aboard the sleepy train to visit Mother Goose Barty's stop is Snoozy Lane to rest his sweet caboose Mom, I'm not a little kid anymore.
Tuck-in time is lame.
Well, if loving my kids is lame, then I guess I'm just a big lame.
Mom, it's lame to be proud of being lame.
- Well, life is like a box of chocolates.
- Mom, no! Mom! You never know- what you're gonna get.
what you're gonna get.
Ninety-nine cents? I want to buy a copy of Bonestorm.
Here's 99 cents.
Allow me to summarize the proposed transaction.
You wish to purchase Bonestorm for 99 cents.
Net profit to me, negative $59.
Oh, oh, please take my $59.
I don't want it.
It's yours.
Eh, eh, eh! Seeing as we are unfamiliar with sarcasm I shall close the register at this point and state that 99 cents is the rental price.
Oh, then may I please rent it, please? You may not.
I am all out.
Though I do have a surprising abundance of Lee Carvallo's Putting Challenge.
Ohh! Milhouse has Bonestorm! This is great! And all I've done is enter my name-Thrillhouse! Say, cool dude, can I play too? Uh- Uh, it's only a one-player game.
- Then how come it says "second player score"? - Mom! Bart's swearing! - Hey! What the hell- - No, no, no! Out! - Damn it, I wasn't swearing! - Out right now! Out! Hmm.
Maybe if I stand next to the games looking sad someone will feel sorry for me and buy me one.
Gavin, don't you already have this game? No, Mom, you idiot! - I have Bloodstorm and Bonesquad and Bloodstorm II, stupid! - Oh, I'm sorry, honey.
- We'll take a Bonestorm.
- Get two! I'm not sharing with Caitlin.
That must be the happiest kid in the world.
Psst.
! Hey, Simpson.
Check this out.
Look what I got! It's the kind I like.
Are you guys shoplifting? Four-finger discount, dude.
Shoplifting is a victimless crime like punching someone in the dark! Yeah! Go ahead-a, Bart.
Take-a the Bonestorm.
The store, she's so rich she'll-a never notice.
Duh, it's the company's fault for making you want it so much.
Don't do it, son.
How's that game gonna help your putting? Just take it! Take it, take it, take it, take it, take it! Take it! I'm outside.
I got away with it.
I'm free! Sir, would you open your coat, please? Uhh, I don't think this is the kind of coat that opens.
Please step back in the store, sir.
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.
That boy's parents must've made some terrible mistakes.
Shut up, Mom! Ho-ho-ho! Here you go, little fella.
- No, no.
None for him.
- Oh, I see.
Hi, I'm Troy McClure.
You might remember me from such public service videos as Designated Drivers: The Lifesaving Nerds and Phony Tornado Alarms Reduce Readiness.
I'm here today to give you the skinny on shoplifting, thereby completing my plea bargain with the good people at Foot Locker of Beverly Hills.
Shoplifting began here in ancient Phoenicia.
Thieves would literally lift the corner of a shop in order to snatch the sweet, sweet olives within.
Oh, Sheheqazaramesh, will you ever learn? - Flash forward to ancient Babylonia.
- All right, show's over.
- Uh, excuse me- - You think you're pretty smart, don't you? - No.
- Don't smart off to me, smart guy.
I-I-I could pay for the game.
I-I'll pay for it! You know, that kind of mush might fly at Lamps Plus, but don't peddle it here.
If I wanted smoke blown up my ass I'd be at home with a pack of cigarettes and a short length of hose.
That's it, Mr.
Comedian.
I'm calling your parents.
Hello, Mr.
and Mrs.
Simpson? This is Detective Don Brodka from Try-N-Save security.
That's right, Don Brodka.
Your son, Bart, has been caught shoplifting.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, it's a shame, I know but, well, try and have a merry Christmas.
They weren't home.
Uh-huh.
But I left a message on their answering machine.
That's right.
Um, okay.
I've really, really, really learned my lesson.
- Can I please go now? - Yeah, get out of my sight.
Hey, kid.
One more thing: If you ever set foot in this store again you'll be spending Christmas in juvenile hall, capisce? - Well, do you understand? - Everything except "capeesh.
" Lousy, stinking piece of crap.
Gotta change that answering machine tape! Oh, God, I gotta change that tape! Gotta change Maggie! Dear God, we gotta change Maggie! - Hmm.
We didn't have a message when we left.
How very odd.
Hello, Muddah.
Hello, Faddah Here I am at Camp Granada Marge, is Lisa at Camp Granada? Now to put this tape where no one will ever listen to it.
Homer, didn't you get any milk? All I see is eggnog.
'Tis the season, Marge! We only get 30 sweet, noggy days.
Then the government takes it away again.
I think I'm having chest pains.
Bart, get your suit on.
- What for? - We're getting our Christmas picture taken.
Ah, you lucked out, Marge, my man, 'cause I'm in a smilin' mood today.
Well, good! So get ready, and before you know it we'll be at the Try-N-Save.
Try-N-Save? Ah, my teapots are ready.
If you ever set foot in this store again, you'll be spending Christmas in juvenile hall- juvenile hall-juvenile hall.
Stand behind the yellow line.
! You will now receive your Christmas presents donated by the Port Authority Lost and Found Office.
Pass your chit to Santa to receive your gift.
If you do not have a chit, you will not receive a gift.
Wow! The March 8 newspaper! Cool! A book of carpet samples! Come on, new bike! Ohh.
A soiled wig.
Merry Christmas and a happy New Year.
Bart, what's taking so long? If you're having that problem with your zipper, I can send your father up.
Oh, no, I'm not.
What's the matter with your face? Is that a fake nose? Are you wearing chin putty? I don't have to listen to these wild allegations! Please, Bart, no more pranks.
It would mean so much to me if we could have just one nice family photo.
Hey! I don't remember saying that.
Uh-oh.
Almost forgot to lock the doors.
I hope you're going to the Valley Vista Try-N-Save, kid 'cause you don't want to come to my store.
Catfish? So, we're just gonna do this photo and get out, right? Bada bing, bada boom.
I want to look at the pets, and write things on the typewriters - and see if the new dictionaries are in.
- Okay.
I want to price some flip-flops, and smell the new tires and consult the pharmacist for some free medical advice! Sure! We're gonna have a great day! Bada bing, bada boom! Right, Bart? Bart? What's wrong, honey? Uh-oh! Somebody's got tired little legs.
- Hm! - Uhh! Hmm.
I wonder where the flip-flops are? Menswear? Maybe it's Sporting Goods.
Wait, no, Sleepwear.
Oh, probably Better Living.
Oh, Homie.
Look at that watch.
I've always wanted a watch like that.
- Well, maybe someone will give you one for Christmas.
Now she'll really be surprised when she opens that ironing board cover.
Must've been a pretty slow century.
The store detective! - Hey, Ansel Adams, let's go! Take the photo! - Oh, wait, wait! I don't want Maggie's face hidden behind that pacifier.
Don't worry, Mama.
I can put a smile on baby's face.
Okay, sugar plum.
It's time to meet Mr.
Funny Voice.
Hello, I'll- Oh, it's just air.
Oh, come on! Hurry up! Okay, people.
One, two, three.
I thought I told you: - no returns for busted merchandise.
- What are you doing to my son? I'm afraid your son broke the 11 th Commandment: Thou shalt not steal.
That's crazy! Bart's not a shoplifter.
He's just a little boy.
Oh, sure.
Now he's just a little boy stealing little toys.
But someday he'll be a grown man stealing stadiums and- and quarries.
My son may not be perfect, but I know in my heart he's not a shoplifter.
Fine, play the tape.
Then everyone can see you've got the wrong boy.
Wait! Mom, I don't want you to see this.
I did it.
Bart, I wouldn't have expected this even from you.
My son's a thief.
Oh, Bart.
Stealing! How could you? Haven't you learned anything from that guy who gives those sermons at church? Captain What's-his-name? We live in a society of laws! Why do you think I took you to all those Police Academy movies? For fun? Well, I didn't hear anybody laughing! Did you? Except at that guy who made sound effects.
Honk, honk! Where was I? Oh, yeah.
Stay out of my booze! Mom, I'm really sorry.
- I know you are.
- Is there anything I can do? I don't know.
- Why don't you go to bed? - Okay.
Man, I thought Mom was gonna scream me stupid.
She didn't even raise her voice.
I admit I haven't known Mom as long as you have, but I know when she's really upset.
Her heart won't just wipe clean like this bathroom countertop.
It absorbs everything that touches it like this bathroom rug.
Really? You think this might be - one of those forever-type things? - I don't know.
Lisa's on the sleepy train to rest her weary head Her ticket is a candy cane made out of gingerbread - Good night, Mom.
- Good night, sweetheart.
Oh, great.
The Tuck-in Express is right on time.
Good night.
I've figured out the boy's punishment.
First, he's grounded.
No leaving the house, not even for school.
Second, no eggnog.
In fact, no nog period.
And third, absolutely no stealing for three months.
I always thought I understood my special little guy.
But somewhere along the road, his hand slipped away from mine.
Eh, what are you gonna do? He's not my little baby anymore.
Maybe I mother him too much.
Hey, Mom, you didn't wake me up.
Here's your hot chocolate.
You didn't put my marshmallow in.
I think you're old enough to do it yourself now.
Okay.
I can handle that.
Hey, give me a slice! Milhouse, do you ever worry that your mom might stop loving you? What? I'm more worried about piranhas.
Did you see that movie where they sent a nuclear submarine to fight the piranhas and one of them swims right down the periscope and bites the guy in the eye and he goes, "Aah! Aah! Aah!" and that old lady told him it would happen? Yeah, that was pretty good.
Hey, how come you're not playing Bonestorm? Ahh, it got boring.
I'm really into this cup and ball now.
Whoa! Wow! - Man, you never know which way this crazy ball's gonna go! - Yeah, right.
You're just trying to trick me, 'cause you don't want me playing with your video game.
Here, go ahead.
- No.
Let me try the cup and ball.
- Get your own! - Come on! Don't be a cup-and-ball hog! - Hey, give it! That's mine! - Give me the cup and ball, you cup-and-ball hog! - Give it, give it! - Come on, you little oink-oink! - Mom! Bart's smoking! - All right! Out, out, out! Go, go, go! - But Milhouse-What are you- - Okay, okay, okay.
I won't bug Milhouse.
- Out! But, well, Mrs.
Van Houten, this is gonna sound kinda dumb but can I hang out with you while you do mom stuff? - Who are Dan and Sherry Adler? - Just friends of ours.
Oh.
And who is Warren Burke? He used to tune our piano before we got rid of it.
He grew up in Mechanicsburg.
- Oh, really? - Hmm.
Tell me I'm good.
Oh, hey, that's Mom! She's happy again! You guys made a snowman family? Check it out, boy.
It's like looking into a living snow mirror.
- Why didn't you wait for me? - I didn't think you'd mind.
I figured you were getting a little too old for this.
But you can still make one.
There's some snow left under the car.
Stupid family.
Hey, Simpson.
Look what I swiped from Try-N-Save.
- It's a replacement tire for a wheelbarrow.
- Huh? I knew you'd like it.
Everybody thinks I'm the black sheep.
Well, I'll show 'em what a black sheep can do! Mom, this fake snow is making me dizzy.
We're almost finished.
There's just a little bit of green left.
There you are.
You can help me spray the cookies.
- Are you hiding something? What do you have under your jacket? - Nothing! Oh, Bart, not again! Give it to me.
I told you.
I don't have anything.
You can't hide from me in this house, Bart.
I spend 23 hours a day here! Get him, Ma.
There's no place left to run, Bart.
Hand it over.
Oh, Bart.
I can't believe you did this.
I wanted to surprise you for Christmas.
Oh, sweetie, this is the best present a mother could get.
I love you so much! My little, bitty Barty! Mom! Since I got my present early, I think you should get yours early too.
Bart get a present early? Then I should get a present early.
I want a present! - Lisa, you have to wait.
- Great.
This is the worst Christmas ever.
Now, I know you love video games, and I asked the clerk - "Which is the one every boy wants?" - You got me- Oh-h-h! Oh, yeah! Thanks, Mom.
Welcome to Lee Carvallo's Putting Challenge.
I am Carvallo.
Now choose a club.
You have chosen a three-wood.
May I suggest a putter? Three-wood.
Now, enter the force of your swing.
I suggest "feather touch.
" You have entered "power drive.
" Now, push 7-8-7 to swing.
Ball is in parking lot.
Would you like to play again? You have selected "no.
" Shh!
The Simpsons D'oh! Oh, my God! The Mad magazine special edition.
They only put out 17 of these a year! Boy, they're really sockin' it to that Spiro Agnew guy again.
He must work there or something.
- Let's do the fold-in.
- Okay.
"What higher power do TV evangelists worship?" - I'll say God.
- I'll sayJesus.
- "The almighty dollar"? - You fold it, you bought it.
Whoo! "Snappy answers to stupid questions.
" I'm great at these.
Ask me if something smells funny in here, boy.
- Does something smell funny in here? - I don't think so, stupid.
- Homie, you want pork chops? - No, I want roast beef, you clod! Look at this.
Special insert: "Iron-on madness.
Ban the bath.
Don't trust anyone over 10.
Sock it to me!" Those magazines create a dangerous amount of laughter.
"The 'all-ighty ollar"'? I get it.
Say, business stinks tonight.
Where's Barney, Lenny and Carl? They never come around anymore now that they got their mistresses.
Might as well close the dump.
- I am gonna drink you under the table.
- No.
I am going to drink you under the- Well, you're closin'.
It's gettin' late.
My kids are probably wondering where their daddy is.
There's gotta be some other place we can go.
Think, Moe! Think! Sorry.
It's league night.
I couldn't give a lane to my own mother.
I have no son.
Man, you go through life, you try to be nice to people you struggle to resist the urge to punch 'em in the face, and for what? For some pimply little puke that treats ya like dirt unless you're on a team.
Well, I'm better than dirt.
Well, most kinds of dirt.
I mean, not that fancy, store-bought dirt.
That stuff's loaded with nutrients.
I can't compete with that stuff.
That I cannot bowl wreaks havoc with my self-esteem as well, but who am I to complain? Well, I'm tired of being a wannabe league bowler.
I wanna be a league bowler! Hey, we can be a team.
Excuse me, but my team is ready to bowl.
- You're short one person.
- Uh that long-haired freak's bowled with us for years.
I don't care if it takes me all night.
I'm gonna get me that lobster harmonica.
Come on, lobstie.
Whoo.
- Oh, okay.
Then I just need your $500 registration fee.
- $500! Oh, no problem.
Would you take an out-of-state, two-party, bad check? No, I will not pay you $500 for sex.
Aw, come on, Marge.
You're getting something in return, and I'm getting a bowling team.
- It's win-win.
- It's sick and I don't have that kind of money to spend on sex.
Maybe you could get someone with money to sponsor your team, like Mr.
Burns.
Burns never gives money to anybody.
- Just last week, I asked him for $1,500.
- For what? Oh, I gotta get the third degree from you too? - Tonight's homework assignment is- - Oh, man, is it hot in here.
I'd better take off my sweater.
"Down with"- "homework"? - Don't look at it, children.
- His shirt makes a good point.
I'm with the shirt! Homework rots! Down with homework! Down with homework! Mmm.
As I was saying, my yearly evaluation couldn't have come at a better time.
Well, Seymour, I must say, for once, I am impressed.
In fact, I am going to give this school a perfect 10.
I'll just write the zero first.
Now a vertical line to indicate the one.
Down with homework! Skinner, why are there children walking on my head? So, we meet again, Mad magazine.
- How do you know it's from Mad? - The year was 1968.
We were on recon in a steaming Mekong delta.
An overheated private removed his flak jacket, revealing a T-shirt with an iron-on sporting the Mad slogan "up with miniskirts.
" Well, we all had a good laugh, even though I didn't quite understand it.
But our momentary lapse of concentration allowed Charlie to get the drop on us.
I spent the next three years in a P.
O.
W.
camp forced to subsist on a thin stew made of fish, vegetables prawns, coconut milk and four kinds of rice.
I came close to madness trying to find it here in the States but they just can't get the spices right.
- Uh, my punishment? - Hmm? Oh, I'm gonna have to think about that.
Meanwhile, wear this home.
No-o-o.
I need some more ether.
I can still feel the movement of the emery board.
- We're fresh out, sir.
I'll get some more.
- Leave the rag.
Mmm.
Uh, excuse me, Mr.
Burns.
Pop 'n' Fresh, you glutinous little dough boy! There's something I've wanted to do to you for years.
Ow.
Mr.
Burns, I was wondering if you'd like to sponsor my bowling team for $500.
Why, certainly, Pop 'n' Fresh.
I owe my robust physique to your tubes of triple-bleached goo.
Whoo-hoo! Hey, everybody, if you wanna ask Burns for a favor, now's the time! He's doped up or dyin' or somethin'! Uh, excuse me.
I'd like to request $17 for a push broom rebristling.
Why, it's that delightful TV leprechaun! I'm going to get your Lucky Charms.
Oh, no.
My brains.
Hey, nice, quote, uniforms, end quote.
This just in.
A new addition to our worst-dressed list: those guys! Oh, forget this.
I am far too fragile to withstand an evening of barbs like that.
Oh, come on.
If we quit now, we'll never know how badly they're gonna beat us.
Yeah, you're right.
That's the kind of thing that would haunt ya.
- Hey! - SÃ­.
: Buenas noches, senoritas.
! What did he say? What did he say? Was that about me? Okay, Otto.
Pressure's on.
Don't choke.
Don't choke.
Don't choke.
Don't choke.
Oh, man! I knew I was gonna choke.
- That's a funny-lookin' strike.
- Come on, guys.
Let's be the team that supports each other.
You can do it, Otto! You can do it, Otto! Help each other out! That'll be our motto! You can do it, Otto! You can do it, Otto! Make this spare, I give you free gelato! Then back to my place, where I will get you blotto! - Domo arigato, Mr.
Roboto.
- You can do it, Otto! You can do it- Guys, I made the spare.
We won.
Yes! Yeah! All right! Those beers are five dollars apiece.
- Let me set the scene for you, Marge.
- All right.
- It's a 7-10 split, the hardest shot in bowling.
- Uh-huh.
It was all up to me, so I got up all my courage.
Right away, my lips started to move and I came up with a chant that won the match! - Who knocked down the pins? - I don't know.
You know, some guy.
Otto, I guess.
- Good for him.
- Yes, but, Marge, you're missing the point.
The individual doesn't matter.
It was a team effort.
And I was the one who came up with the whole team idea.
- Me.
- I can't believe Otto picked up a 7-10 split.
- He's phenomenal.
Wow.
- But- Several days ago, a violent riot erupted incited by an inflammatory T-shirt slogan.
No, no.
Now, don't try to remember what that slogan was.
To ensure that this frenzied dance of destruction is never repeated I've decided, starting Monday, all students will be required to wear uniforms.
Huh? Uniforms? Say hello to our little genius, Martin, who looks even smarter in this vest and short pant combination from Mr.
Boy of Main Street.
Or how about little Lisa Simpson? She'll have no reason to play the blues in this snappy ensemble topped off with a saucy French beret that seems to scream "silence.
" All right.
Pick your size: extra small or extra large.
We've got both.
No pushing now.
I-What? Oh, I've just been informed we've run out of extra large.
Go, Moe.
! Go, Moe.
! Don't make Homer shout out, "D'oh.
!" Yeah! Yea! All right, Snake.
Make us proud.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10.
Bye! Ah, we forfeit.
We'll take it.
There it is, boys: the championship trophy.
Whoo.
We will never possess it.
The Holy Rollers have won it five years in a row.
They think they're so high and mighty just 'cause they never got caught drivin' without pants.
God boy couldn't get a strike! It's me.
Ned.
Mom, my slingshot doesn't fit in these pockets and these shorts leave nothing to the imagination.
- These uniforms suck.
- Bart, where do you pick up words like that? Yeah, Moe, that team sure did suck last night.
Theyjust plain sucked.
I've seen teams suck before, but they were the suckiest bunch of sucks that ever sucked.
- Homer, watch your mouth! - I gotta go.
My damn wiener kids are listening.
- We are not wieners.
- Then what are you dressed like that for? - They made us.
- Oh.
"They made us.
" That's loser talk.
You gotta start acting more like me and my team the future league champions of the world.
Nothing's gonna stop us now.
Stop everything! I don't remember writing a check for bowling.
- Sir, that's a check for your boweling.
- Oh, yes.
That's very important.
Yes, sir.
Remember that month you didn't do it? Yes, that was unpleasant for all concerned.
Anyway, back to the checks.
Stop everything! - I don't remember writing a check for bowling.
- Hmm.
The memo says, "To my pal, Pop 'n' Fresh.
" Oh, yes.
That greedy, grasping glob of chemicals.
Probably one of your ether-induced hallucinations, sir.
I'll check the employee files to see who could pull off such an impersonation.
It was either Pops Freshenmeyer or Homer Simpson.
Simpson, eh? Let's shut down this bowling scam right now.
Come on, Homer.
Come on, Homer.
Pretend this is baseball and hit us a homer.
You rolled it.
You rolled it.
By the way, rhyming "Homer" with "Homer"- Look at them, Smithers, enjoying their embezzlement.
I have a much uglier word for it, sir: misappropriation.
Simpson.
! Listen here.
I want to join your team.
- You wanna join my what? - You wanna what his team? I've had one of my unpredictable changes of heart.
Seeing these fine young athletes reveling in the humiliation of a vanquished foe- I haven't felt this energized since my last boweling.
Oh, man.
He'll blow our winning streak.
Yeah.
Call this an unfair generalization if you must but old people are no good at everything.
Look, guys, it's not that simple.
He's my boss.
I'll tell you what.
I'll give him a shot, and if he stinks it'll be easier to tell him no.
Ooh- Welcome aboard! It wasn't any easier.
Ah, these uniforms are a godsend.
Horseplay's down 40%.
Youthful exuberance has been cut in half.
High spirits are at an all-time low.
- They've even begun blinking in unison.
- I love that sound.
Now, children, while you're having quiet time I'm going to make sure my desk is exactly parallel to the rear wall.
Oh, there's something I used to do in this situation, but can't remember.
Ha- ho? I can't believe I got booted off the team for Mr.
Businessman.
I bet I'll get a little respect once I get that Harvard diploma.
Look at that.
All the way to the end with only one push.
That's the third game in a row he cost us, Homer.
- Mamma mia.
! - Hoot, mon! - Yee-haw! - Arr, me mateys.
Arr.
Whoo! They begged me to join their team- begged me.
Well, we certainly got walloped tonight, eh, fellas? Well- Uh, Mr.
Burns, next week is the big championship game.
Ah, yes, that silly championship.
The only ship worth a damn is friendship.
Look.
Here comes the "friend ship" sailing your way.
Ooh, here.
Let me get that, friend.
Oops.
Lost a nail.
Well, that's leprosy for you.
You're it.
- Now you are the one who is it.
- Understood.
Well, I've gotta hand it to you, Seymour.
These drab student coverings have created the perfect distraction-free environment thus preparing the children for permanent positions in tomorrow's mills and processing facilities.
Best of all, with less than a minute to go before I leave absolutely nothing has gone wrong.
Well, it is starting to rain, but I could hardly be blamed for that, can I? Yes.
Very good.
Wow! Look at all the colors, man! Red, green, yellow, orange! I remember all of these! I'm freaking out! Hey, something's comin' back to me! - Down with homework! - And down with uniforms.
! Yea! Ow, ow, ow, ow! Skinner why aren't these uniforms colorfast? I don't understand it.
I got them at the same place I buy Mother's dresses, and- - Good Lord! Mother's in the park! - This I've gotta see.
Oh, Marge, we were so close to winning the championship.
Now, thanks to Burns, it's never gonna happen.
And I spent so much time building that trophy case.
Homer, maybe Mr.
Burns will bowl a great game, and you will win your championship.
So you're saying we're definitely gonna win? Whoo-hoo! I won't need this anymore.
Marge, someone broke the toilet.
Don't worry about nothin', Homer.
I have a feeling that Mr.
Burns is gonna have a little accident that might keep him from bowlin' with us tonight, heh, heh, heh.
Smithers, I'm afraid I won't be able to play tonight.
My old gimpy knee has gone akimbo again.
- Take that! - Ooh! Smithers, that precision assault popped it back into place.
Thank you, masked stranger! D'oh! He's gonna ruin everything! All right.
That's it, Homer.
Either Burns goes, or Moe goes.
Yes, I am afraid that I am going to have to make a similar threat with my name in place of Moe's name.
So, who's ready to kick some Christian keister? Oh, uh, Mr.
Burns, as team captain it's my duty to inform you that- Ooh, I almost forgot! I brought you all a little something.
Aww, would you look at that? The "Pin Pals.
" At last, I finally have a garment fine enough to be married in.
I've always been wealthy, but this is the first time I ever felt rich.
- Aww.
- Now, Homer, you were about to say something to me.
- You're off the team.
- What? He's just ribbin' ya, Monty.
Yes.
- Had you going there.
- Guys.
Hey, hey, hey! - Hallelujah.
- Hallelujah.
! Aww.
- Nice one, Homer.
- Thanks.
Okay.
The Holy Rollers are ahead by one pin and we only have one bowler left: Mr.
Burns.
Hmm? Well, next time, a few steps more toward center, don't you think? Good-bye, trophy.
Ooh.
Whatever I got ahold of is big.
- Yes! - Excellent.
Yes! Whoo-hoo! We won! We won! - You mean, I won.
- But we were a team, sir.
Oh, I'm afraid I've had one of my trademark changes of heart.
You see, teamwork will only take you so far.
Then the truly evolved person makes that extra grab for personal glory.
Now I must discard my teammates, much like the boxer must shed roll after roll of sweaty, useless, disgusting flab before he can win the title.
- Ta.
- I guess some people never change.
Or they quickly change and then quickly change back.
You know what? We don't need him or his trophy.
- We got each other, huh? - Yeah, yeah.
That's right, Moe.
Aww.
- Go, Homer, you're our man! If you can't do it, nobody can! Ooh! No! Oh, God! - Well, I guess no one can.
- Run, before they're through feeding! No.
! Oh, God.
! No.
! Shh!

The Simpsons D'oh! Live from the famous brown sands of Public Beach, Delaware it's the Grand Nationals of Sand Castle Building Preview.
Oh! Saturday afternoon TV is so boring.
- Bikini girls.
- Hmm? - Dune buggies.
- Hmm! Daredevil surfers.
Ordinarily this beach would be swarming with them, but not today.
Oh, no! They've all been cleared out to make way for painstaking sand preparation.
That's right, Dick.
This year everyone's abuzz about one thing- the absence of Mark Rodkin.
Oh, wait.
There he is.
- Marge, I'm bored! - Why don't you read something? Because I'm trying to reduce my boredom.
You can hand out these flyers for the neighborhood rummage sale.
You'll get some fresh air and exercise.
Eh, I'll do it anyway.
Come on, boy! We're going to see the neighbors.
Good old Evergreen Terrace.
The swankiest street in the classiest part of Pressboard Estates.
If you love it so much, why are you always littering? It's easier.
Duh! Oh! Howdy, neighbor! May I spray you with the hose in a playful fashion? Eh, spray the boy.
Well, ready for the big rummage sale? Oh, yes, indeed.
I've got nothing but time until they fix that malfunctioning Squishy machine.
Hey, I never noticed this place.
Dad, it's right across the street from us.
That fancy house will never sell.
Nobody who could afford it would want to live in this neighborhood.
Hey, what's wrong with this neighborhood? Big shot! Too good to buy a house here, snobby? - Who you talking to, Homer? - The guy who doesn't live there.
Can we get rid of this ayatollah T-shirt? Khomeini died years ago.
But, Marge, it works on any ayatollah- Ayatollah Nakhbadeh, Ayatollah Zahedi.
As we speak, Ayatollah Razmara and his cadre of fanatics are consolidating their power.
I don't care who's consolidating their power.
Well, we don't need this.
Marge, that's the Rhinestone Nights Fashion Gun! - I need it to rhinestone up my old clothing.
- Who's "Disco Stu"? Oh.
Well, I wanted to write "Disco Stud," but I ran out of space.
Not that Disco Stu didn't get his share of the action.
So, if you're looking for a half bag of charcoal briquettes or an artificial Christmas tree, trunk only come on over to the Hibbert table, pronto! Well, sir, looks like we got some nice items here at Table Glick.
Like this.
What the heckaroonie is this, Mrs.
Glick? It is a candy dish, Ned.
Ninety dollars.
Uh-huh.
Well, I, uh- I guess you could put a lot of nice things in there.
No! Just candy, Ned.
Ninety dollars! Well, looks like somebody sold something today.
Are you interested in that motorized tie rack, Principal Skinner? Hmm.
It's awfully loud.
Well, you can always take the motor out and use it as an ordinary tie rack.
But now the ties are motionless.
Those in back are virtually inaccessible.
Well, it's a moot point as I have only one tie to begin with.
I believe I'll pass.
Have you sold that tie rack yet? - No.
- I'll take it.
Now, folks, nothing spells fun like rhinestones on a dungaree jacket.
Stu, you should buy that.
Hey.
Disco Stu doesn't advertise.
Uh, hey, Ned, let me help you with that.
Hey, everybody! Who thinks Flanders should shut up? So, anyone here from Evergreen Terrace? I think this is the best neighborhood in town.
Anybody agree with me? - You're the king, Homer! - King of the neighborhood! Say, that ayatollah thinks he's better than America.
Is he right? - No! - Yes.
- For only five dollars, you can sock it to him in style.
- Right here! And for the man who has everything, a tie-rack motor.
I'll take that.
Hey, big spender Dig this blender Rainbow suspenders Hey, big spender We surrender Spend Some dough at table three Thank you, neighbors.
Thank you.
Now, let's give it up for table five! Ah, ah, ah, ah Table five, table five Ah, ah, ah, ah Table fi-i-i-ive Table five Table five Hey, what's the big deal? It's just some new guy moving in.
Disco Stu likes disco music.
Hi there, neighbors.
Uh, I'm George Bush.
Former president George Bush? Oh, former president George Bush! Okay, let's give it up for the new guy! Now, let's all turn around and pay attention to me again.
Hello.
Hello! Hello! Wow! A former president living right across the street! Oh, why did he have to move in on my territory? Look at him.
Thinks just because he led the free world he can act like a big shot! Stupid president! Why couldn't he just stay in his own state? Actually, this is one of the nine states where Mr.
Bush claims residency, Dad.
I wouldn't have voted for him, but it's nice to have a celebrity in the neighborhood.
Wait a minute.
If Lisa didn't vote for him, and I didn't vote for him- You didn't vote for anybody.
I voted for Prell to go back to the old glass bottle.
After that, I became deeply cynical.
And your business here, Mr.
Flanders? Well, sir, I'm welcoming the Bushes on behalf of the neighborhood association.
Never mind about that, Ray.
Just give 'em a quick pass with the metal detector and let 'em on in.
Hey, Bar! The neighbors are here.
Howdilly-doodilly there, President Bush- Or should I say President Neighbor? I'm Ned Flanders, and this is Maude, Rod and Todd.
Howdilly-doodilly yourself there, Ned.
This is my wife, Barbara.
Call her Bar.
Would you like some lemonade? - Tiptop-notch! - Okilly-dokilly.
Thankilly-dankilly.
- Greatalicious.
- Scrumpdiddlerific.
Fine and dandy like sour candy! Bar's a whiz with cold drinks, aren't you, Bar? Don't understand lemonade myself.
Not my forte.
What brings you to Springfield? George and I just wanted to be private citizens again go where nobody cared about politics.
So we found the town with the lowest voter turnout in America.
Just happy to be here among good, average people with no particular hopes or dreams.
But, Mr.
President, we're not all good people.
There's one little boy you should watch out for.
He's a bad, bad little boy.
Now, Todd, don't scare the president.
Oh, look at those phonies sucking up to Bush.
I guess you might say he's barking up the wrong Bush.
There it is, Homer.
The cleverest thing you'll ever say, and nobody heard it.
D'oh! Just gonna relax with my U.
S.
News & World whatnot.
Oh, good.
Roasting the new guy.
Hello, Mr.
Bush! George, this is a neighborhood boy, Bart Simpson.
- He came over to say hi.
- Yeah.
Hello.
- Hi! Hey, what's this? - My electric card shuffler.
Don't go near that- Now, I told you- Oh, those cards are from Air Force One and they only give you so many packs.
Oh, George! Boys will be boys.
Bart's just being friendly.
Why don't you get off that sofa and show Bart your photos? Oh, but he'll gunk 'em all up.
His hands are probably covered with mud and cookies.
He probably stole a napkin.
- Who's that, George? - That's me with Charlton Heston.
- He was- - Who's that, George? You wouldn't know him.
That's Bob Mosbacher.
He was secretary of- That's a dumb name.
Who's that, George? Maybe he thinks "Bart" is a dumb- - How many times were you president, George? - Just once.
Bar, isn't it time for dinner yet? I'm making rice.
It'll be a while.
Did your Secret Service goons ever whack anybody, George? You know, in my day little boys didn't call their elders by their first names.
Yeah? Well, welcome to the 20th century, George.
I'll kick you right out of the 20th century, you little- Oh, man.
I only got one minute till they stop serving those breakfast balls! D'oh! Ah, let's see now.
What do you folks have here, huh? Hmm.
A Krusty Burger.
That doesn't sound too appetizing.
What kind of stew do you have today? Uh, we don't have stew.
Sir, why don't you just have the cheeseburger? That's really more of a weekend thing, Ray.
Hey, jerk! Move your fanny! That guy's louder than World War II.
Ray, go see what the rhubarb is, will you? Sir, could you pop your hood? Hey, my taxes paid for that horn! Why, hello, Mrs.
Bush.
Hi, Bart.
Mr.
Bush is upstairs napping.
Your husband's awful grumpy.
Oh, that's just his way.
He really likes you.
You know, it's time for him to get up and work on his memoirs.
Why don't you go wake him? What the- Great Scott! Don't touch that.
That's the alpenhorn Helmut Kohl gave me.
- Where'd you get those pajamas? - They're presidential pajamas.
You have to be president, and you're not president.
- Yes, I am.
- D- No, you're not.
Bar! - Hey, where's your candy? - We don't have any.
Now, go away! George! Older people don't eat much candy, Bart, but I could bake you some cookies.
Can't remember the last time she made cookies for me.
- What's that? - Oh, n-nothing.
All right.
His story checks out.
Marge, would you love me more if I were president? 'Cause I'll do it if it'll make you happy.
Homie, as long as you keep the car full of gas, I'm happy.
Well, you can always depend on that.
And since I'd achieved all my goals as president in one term there was no need for a second.
The end.
Mmm.
Good memoirs.
Good, not great.
Now, let's look at that old outboard.
Soup that baby up, rattle a few windows down Kennebunkport next May.
Hello, Mr.
Bush! - What ya doin'? - Now, don't upset the desk there.
- Careful! You don't want to horse around with- - Hey, cool! What does this do? Now, don't you pull that cord, young man! - No, no.
Hey.
! - Whoops.
Bar, my motor's gone loco! Oh, the birdhouse! My prize orchids! No.
Not the memoirs.
Don't even think about it.
Not gonna happen.
- Whoa, man.
- Whoa nothing.
I'm gonna do something your daddy should've done a long time ago.
Now, go home and think about what you've done, young man.
He spanked you? You? Bart Simpson? I begged him to stop, but he said it was for the good of the nation.
Big deal! When I was a pup, we got spanked by presidents till the cows came home.
Grover Cleveland spanked me on two nonconsecutive occasions! Grampa, I know in your day spanking was common but Homer and I just don't believe in that kind of punishment.
And that's why your no-good kids are running wild! First, Bush invades my home turf, then he takes my pals then he makes fun of the way I talk probably.
Now he steals my right to raise a disobedient, smart-alecky son! Well, that's it! Hey, Bush! Get out here! Excuse me, sir.
Where are you going? I'm going to punch George Bush in the face.
Okay.
Is he expecting you? - You owe me an apology! - Hey, you owe me an apology.
If you were any kind of a father you'd have disciplined that boy a long time ago.
You want to step back, sir? You're trampling the flowers.
Ooh! Hiding behind your goons, eh, Bush? Whoa! Well, you are a wimp! Wimp, am I? AgentJohnson, Agent Heintz you men stand down.
All right, mister, you want trouble, you're gonna get trouble.
Oh, I want trouble, all right.
- Then you're gonna get trouble.
- No, you're gonna get trouble.
Oh, that's good.
That's good, 'cause I want trouble.
- Then we're agreed.
There'll be trouble.
- Oh, yeah! Lots of trouble.
- Trouble it is! - For you.
D'oh! This is gonna be sweet.
Two hundred bottle rockets, and George Bush doing toe touches by an open window.
You get one up his butt, it's a million points.
Why don't you just say you're sorry, George? Because I'm right.
Oh, no.
I'm gonna fix their wagon good.
I've pulled some pranks in my time.
I- I don't understand.
Are you saying you and Barbara are bad neighbors? No! That's not Bar and me.
It's them.
- Who? Maude and me? - No! The man and his boy.
You know, the- the boy is named Bart.
I don't know the name of the man.
Bar! What's the name of the man? - I'm not getting involved, George.
- Look, just never mind.
I thought the banner was pretty straightforward, but I guess I'll just take it down.
George, it's time to get dressed.
Nuh-uh.
Not going outside today, not with those neighbors.
Staying right here till my speech to the Elks Club.
Yoo-hoo.
! - Who is it? - It's your sons, George Bush Jr.
and Jeb Bush.
- Come outside, Dad.
- Oh, good.
Bar! The boys are in the front yard.
They'll help me think of a plan to get those Simpsons.
Oh, George! Is that all you ever think about? The boys probably just want a letter of recommendation.
- Boys? Where are you going? - Okay, son.
Give him the glue! Hey, lookin'good.
! And that's why I will continue to oppose teen alcoholism in all its forms.
Now, are there any questions? Keeping in mind that I already explained about my hair.
Oh, yeah, that's right.
The Simpsons.
President Bush is driving on our lawn.
- He must be lost.
- He's not lost.
Looks like we're experiencing some blowback from the wig offensive.
- It's time to hit him where he lives.
- His house? Bingo.
So I thought to myself, "What would God do in this situation?" Locusts.
They'll drive him nuts.
It's all in the Bible, son.
It's the prankster's bible.
Hmm.
I can't decide if this'll be considered feisty or crazy.
Hey! Hey, what the- Oh, if he thinks George Bush'll stay out of the sewer he doesn't know George Bush.
Hey, turkeys! Behind ya.
For the last time, Bush, apologize for spanking my boy! Never.
You make him apologize for destroying my memoirs.
You didn't tell me you destroyed his memoirs.
Never! Yea, Dad! I really feel awful about your lawn, Marge.
George can be so stubborn when he thinks he's right.
Oh, Homer too.
They're so much alike.
Too bad they got off on the wrong foot.
It's just like the Noriega thing.
Now he and George are the best of friends.
Here's a little something we learned in C.
I.
A.
- Get him, boys! - Ow! Ow! Hello! Hello! Now I'll ruin you like a Japanese banquet.
I'll take your head and- Gorbachev? What-What are you doing here? I just dropped by with present for warming of house.
Instead find you grappling with local oaf.
Oh, brought some of your commie friends to help you fight dirty, eh? Mikhail, they put a wig on my head, my memoirs got- George, this is the last straw.
! You apologize to Homer right now! But, Bar, we can't show any weakness in front of the Russians.
George! Yes, dear.
Okay.
I'm sorry I spanked your boy, Homer.
Whoo-hoo! In your face, Bush.
Now apologize for the tax hike.
It's a shame it didn't work out, Marge but George just felt this neighborhood brought out the worst in him and- Oh, my.
Well, so long! Bye-bye.
Hi! Pleased to meet you.
I just moved in.
My name is Jerry Ford.
Former president Gerald Ford? Put 'er there.
I'm Homer Simpson.
- Say, Homer, do you like football? - Do I ever! - Do you like nachos? - Yes, Mr.
Ford.
Well, why don't you come over and watch the game and we'll have nachos and then some beer? Ooh! Jerry, I think you and I are gonna get along just- D'oh! Shh!
 Oh, he wants that corn so much.
Ay.
!: Dios no me ama.
! I want to see what's on the other broadcasts.
Where's the oscillator on this thing? No, Grampa! Don't! - Dad, sit down! - Gosh darn it! What does this do? Oh, I'll make my adjustments here and- Yea! We're getting a new TV! Let's go to the Sharper Image.
They've got a TV shaped like a '50s diner! No! Let's go to The Nature Company.
They've got a TV assembled by Hopi Indians.
We can't afford to shop at any store that has a philosophy.
We just need a TV.
- We're going to go to the outlet mall in Ogdenville.
Look at these low, low prices on famous brand-name electronics! Don't be a sap, Dad.
These are just crappy knock-offs.
I know a genuine Panaphonics when I see it.
And look, there's Magnetbox and Sorny.
I'm not going to lie to you.
Those are all superior machines.
But if you like to watch your TV, and I mean really watch it you want the CarnivalÃ©.
It features two-pronged wall plug, pre-molded hand-grip well durable outer casing to prevent fall-apart.
Sold! You wrap it up, I'll start bringing in the pennies.
Honey, I don't think these clothes are us.
Who are they? Hey, Brandine! You could wear this shirt to work.
Oh, Cletis, you know I gotta wear the shirt what Dairy Queen give me.
Hey, Mom.
! There's something in here.
! Ooh! Oh, it's beautiful.
Can it be a real Chanel? It is! Ninety dollars? But it's marked down from 2,800.
Oh, you look so sophisticated.
Just like Mary Hart.
It fits like a dream too.
But we can't afford $90, even if it is a bargain.
It wouldn't be right to buy something just for me.
If it were a suit we could all wear, maybe then- Come on, Mom! You never treat yourself to anything.
Oh, sure I do.
I treated myself to a Sanka not three days ago.
But this is a real find.
Just buy it.
You don't have to rationalize everything.
Hmm.
All right, I will buy it! It'll be good for the economy.
You look great! Really? You like it? Oh, I'd love to wear this someplace special.
Sperlock's Cafeteria it is.
What about the symphony or the theater? Oh- What's the point of going out? We're just gonna wind up back here anyway.
Oh, Mrs.
Simpson, you are looking very prosperous today.
Might I interest you in some of our impulse items here by the cash register? Perhaps a crazy motorized wiggle pen? Look at the craziness.
- Attendant, I'd like some gas.
- Yes, I'm sorry.
- I do not speak English.
Okay.
- But you were just talking to- Yes, yes.
Hot dog, hot dog.
Yes, sir.
No, sir.
Maybe.
Okay.
Well, I can't pump it myself.
I'm calling Triple "A.
" I used to be a little overwhelmed too.
But it's not that hard.
I can show you.
Marge, is that you? Marge Bouvier from high school? Um, yeah.
Hi.
Hi, Evelyn.
How about that? Marge, you look wonderful! - And to think I heard you married Homer Simpson.
- I did marry Homer.
Come.
You must show me the pumps.
Ninety percent of the time if the gas isn't pumping, this is your problem.
Automotive skills and fashion sense.
Well, you've come a long way from the girl I knew nothing about in high school.
We ran with different crowds.
You had your debutante balls and skinny-dipping and I had my home shoe-repair course.
Oh, Marge, you haven't changed a bit as far as I know.
Say, why don't you drop by the country club tomorrow? Oh, and bring the family! You there.
Fill it up with petroleum distillate.
And revulcanize my tires, posthaste.
Bart, comb your hair! Homer, I don't think you should wear a short-sleeved shirt with a tie.
Oh, but Sipowicz does it.
If Detective Sipowicz jumped off a cliff, would you do that too? Oh, I wish I was Sipowicz.
Do I have to go? That country club is a hotbed of exclusionist snobs and status-seeking social climbers.
I've told you, I don't like you using the word "hotbed.
" Please, Lisa.
We so rarely get to do things like this.
And, everybody, everybody please be on your best behavior.
Bart, no grifting.
Aw, raspberries.
- Name, please? - Simpson family.
We're not poor.
Well, we're not.
Go on in.
They're expecting you at the clubhouse.
- Look at this! - Livin' large! Oh, my! I've always dreamed of coming here.
Everybody keep smiling, and I know we're going to fit right in.
Marge, you made it.
! And you wore that lovely suit.
Karyn, Gillian, Eliza-beth Patri-cia, Robert-a, Su-san, meet Marge.
- Hi.
- How are you doing? Pleased to meet you.
You look like such a happy bunch of people.
That's the trouble with first impressions- you only get to make one.
Th-That reminds me of a funny apron I saw- You know, Marge, your family doesn't have to stand in the alcove.
They're free to enjoy the club.
Uh, come on, kids.
Let's go sit in the car till your mom's done fitting in.
Eliza-beth is right.
Why shout yourself hoarse at incompetent sales clerks when you can get nearly everything mail-order? I won't eat anything unless it's shipped overnight from Vermont or Washington state.
We order our steaks through The New Yorker.
I have a sneaking suspicion that L.
L.
Bean and Eddie Bauer are selling me the same honey.
I get food through the mail, but in a different way.
Every month, Good Housekeeping arrives in my mailbox bursting with recipes.
Sometimes the most satisfying meal is the one you cook yourself.
Hmm.
That's very true, Marge.
One night, Wiff and I came home late, and we decided not to wake Iris.
Instead, we microwaved our own soup! Of course it was a horrible mess.
But Iris didn't mind cleaning it up.
Didn't everybody have a wonderful time? I thought it was so opulent.
Like the Playboy Mansion, but non-sexual.
That place is weird.
A man in the bathroom kept handing me towels till I paid him to stop.
Shoulda held out longer, boy.
- The rich are different from you and me.
- Yes! They're better! Socially better.
And if we fit in, we can be better too.
So today, while the rest of you were out being different, I did a very good job of fitting in.
So good that Evelyn gave us a guest pass.
They might even ask us to join.
Boy, Marge! You must've really done a number on those rich suckers.
Don't thank me.
Thank my beautiful new suit.
Fritz, you idiot! I didn't order a baloney sandwich! I ordered an abalone sandwich! I don't know what Mom's thinking.
This whole country club scene is so decadent.
All these spoiled brats and their smug complacent parents.
It just reinforces the unspoken class system of horses sitting on their high horses- I'm sorry! I gotta go! Oh, we've got a winning hand! We can take the rest of the tricks.
Oh, you'd better be careful.
The purpose of this game is to make friends.
You don't make friends by winning.
Still, there's nothing more popular than a gracious winner.
Don't ask me.
I'm just hair.
Your head stopped 18 inches ago.
Queen of hearts.
I believe all the rest are ours.
Oh, well played.
We could've stopped them if you had changed to a different suit.
I thought perhaps changing suits had gone out of fashion.
Eh, Marge? D'oh! Ho-ho-ho! Hoo-hoo! Ohh! Hmm! You know, Homer, the traditional way to cheat in golf is to lower your score.
- That's one way.
- I'm P.
G.
A.
Tour Pro Tom Kite.
How about I give you a few pointers on your game? - Now, you don't want to overthink.
- Not an issue.
- Keep your head down.
- Huh? Pretend there's no one else here.
And just go at your own pace.
Wow! Very impressive.
You're a natural, Mr.
Simpson.
- Really? - Uh-huh.
All you need is your own set of clubs.
And stay the hell out of my locker! You can keep the shoes.
Marge, did you know that Kennedy and Lincoln had the same handicap? Homer, please.
I have to alter this suit so it looks different for tomorrow.
Just slap some bumper stickers on it and come to bed, will you, Marge? Love your outfit, Marge.
The vest says, "Let's have lunch," but the culottes say, "You're paying.
" Why, thank you, Robert-A! Mom, look.
! I found something more fun than complaining.
! Marge, your family is fitting in perfectly here.
If all goes well at Saturday's ball I'd love to sponsor you for membership.
Oh, that would be a dream come true! I'll be there with bells on.
Bells? Where exactly will you be attaching them to that mangled Chanel suit? Oh, don't worry, Marge.
Her idea of wit is nothing more than an incisive observation humorously phrased and delivered with impeccable timing.
I'm sure you'll be a smash at the ball, and I just know you'll have a lovely new outfit.
- That's some fine chipping, Homer.
- Yeah.
Can you bank it into the handicapped stall? Seat down.
Hmm.
Who is that lavatory linksman, Smithers? Homer Simpson, sir.
One of the fork-and-spoon operators from Sector 7G.
Well, he's certainly got a loose waggle.
Perhaps I've finally found a golfer worthy of a match with Monty Burns, eh? Oh, his waggle is no match for yours, sir.
I've never seen you lose a game.
Except for that one in '74 when you let Richard Nixon win.
That was very kind of you, sir.
Oh, he just looked so forlorn, Smithers, with his "I can't go to prison, Monty.
They'll eat me alive!" Say, I wonder if this Homer Nixon is any relation? Unlikely, sir.
They-They spell and pronounce their name differently.
Bah! Schedule a game and I'll ask him myself.
This game could mean big things for me, Marge.
If I beat Mr.
Burns, I mean, really wallop him bad I'm sure to get that big raise I've been gunning for.
All right, but if you win, don't make a scene and dance around with your "whoo-hoo's.
" Please! We can't afford a single slip-up.
They're judging us.
Mwah.
Mwah! Mom, did you like horses when you were my age? 'Cause I heard- I don't know.
Lisa, tonight is very important.
Mommy has to alter her suit so it looks like a totally new one.
Mom, do you want to know the 15 reasons I like horses better than cars? One- I really need to concentrate on this.
Would you mind just- You know how a horse goes like this? - Mom! - I've altered this so many times, it's nearly impossible to- Whee! Whee! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Lisa, please! Hmm.
No! No, no, no, no! At times like this I guess all you can do is laugh.
I need a formal dress for tonight! You've come to the right place.
We've got classy duds up the ying-yang.
I call this one "Fantasy in Maroon.
" It's got some cigarette burns, but we can patch them up with Nu Vinyl.
It's a bit peppery for me.
Why don't we put this in the "maybe" pile? This was originally a Halloween costume but it found its way into my regular rotation.
Uh-huh.
Good morning, Mr.
Burns.
Beautiful day to be outside, isn't it? Rant on, Simpson, but your vainglorious boasting will only add savor to my inevitable triumph.
Yes.
Whoo-hoo! D'oh! Yes.
You're in deep "d'oh" now.
Perfect as always, sir.
Right on the green.
Oh, quit cogitating, Steinmetz, and use an open-faced club- the sand wedge! Mmm.
Open-faced club sand wedge.
You're four strokes behind, Simpson.
Oh, a cunning stratagem, sir.
It's curving right toward the green.
And it's there! He got to the green in one shot? How can that old man hit so far? Now, keep your head down.
Ignore all distractions.
Miss! Miss? Do you have a Chanel suit, or any other high-quality clothes? No, but we do have a shipment of slightly burnt Sears activewear coming in this afternoon.
Oh, I give up.
What time, and how burnt? Cripes, man! Can't you ever get to the green in less than two shots? Smithers, what are you doing up here? What are you doing with his ball? And all those other balls? Uh, there are no other balls.
Just these, uh, reptile eggs! Oh, step away! They're endangered.
These aren't reptile eggs.
You've been cheating! No matter where Mr.
Burns hits the ball, you put a fresh one on the green! Cheating? For me? Good lord, Smithers! That's patently unnecessary.
I'm one of the world's finest golfers.
In all of the years you've caddied for me, I've never lost a- Oh.
So you're not the best golfer here.
Wait till I tell everyone about this.
You stink.
Homer, Mr.
Burns holds a lot of sway at this club.
If you would keep quiet about the alleged decades of cheating I'm sure he'd support your application for a membership tonight.
Bull hockey! I don't care about joining this stupid club.
But does your wife? Ohh! I knew my kind wasn't welcome here.
Ooh! - Ahh! - Eee! Mom, you are looking fabulous! Yeah.
You look great.
You can do anything with that sewing machine.
No, I can't.
Come on, let's go.
- You mean it's a new dress? Where did you get it? - The outlet store.
Wow! Two finds in one store.
- What are the odds? - Call it fate.
Let's go! - How much did it cost? - A dollar.
Let's go! - With tax or without? - Without! Let me go! - So, with tax, how much was it? - Why do you always have to question everything I do? You look nice, is all.
- Homer, what are you doing? - Driving up to the main building.
- They got valet parking tonight.
- We can't drive this up there.
They'll see the dent.
They'll see the coat hanger antenna.
- Stop the car.
Were walking.
- But, Marge! Valets! For once maybe someone will call me "sir" without adding, "You're making a scene.
" I'm gonna regale everyone with my anecdote.
You know, the one I tried to say on the radio? Who's gonna bleep me this time? I'm gonna pose as an Italian count and get some old lady to leave me all her money.
I'm gonna ask people if they know their servants' last names.
Or, in the case of butlers, their first.
No, no, no! Not tonight! No vulgarity, no mischief, no politics.
Just be good! I'm sorry, Mom.
I'll behave.
I won't say anything controversial.
I just won't say anything.
Okay, honey? You kids should thank your mother.
Now that she's a better person we can see how awful we really are.
Come here, Maggie.
Oh, Homie, I like your in-your-face humanity.
I like the way Lisa speaks her mind.
I like Bart's- I like Bart.
And I like my old green dress.
I didn't have to spend our savings on this stupid gown.
Our savings? Don't worry.
I saved the receipt.
- We'll have a $3,300 credit at Chanel.
- They have beer and gum, right? Come on.
Let's go.
I wouldn't want to join any club that would have this me as a member.
It's okay.
Those snobs never would've made us members anyway.
Well, I wonder where Marge could be.
She's missing her own initiation.
I hope she didn't take my attempt to destroy her too seriously.
Where's Homer? And to think I spent all afternoon baking him this cake.
Mmm! I- Ugh! Mmm! I- Ugh! I pickled the figs myself.
- Hey, did you guys just come from the prom? - Sort of.
But you know, we realized we're more comfortable in a place like this.
Man, you're crazy! This place is a dump.
Oh, man! I'd be anywhere except this place.
That's for sure.
Shh!
The Simpsons D'oh! May I offer my condolences on the untimely passing of your Great-aunt Hortense.
As her only living heirs, you stand to inherit her entire estate.
Poor Aunt Hortense.
Whoo-hoo.
Whoo-hoo.
The only stipulation is that you spend one night in a haunted house.
- Oh.
Isn't that somewhat unusual? - No.
It's a standard clause.
Well, luckily, there's no such thing as ghosts.
Yes, there's no such thing as ghosts.
Best night's sleep I ever had.
Their tap water tasted better than ours.
Here you go- $100 each.
The rest goes to Ann Landers as was stipulated in your aunt's will.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I must have continued talking after you left the office.
I do that sometimes.
Oh, my.
What are you gonna spend your money on, kids? There's a special on tacos down at the Taco Mat- hundred tacos for $100- I'm gonna get that.
I'm gonna contribute my money to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.
Tacos? Public broadcasting? I won't have you kids throwing away your money like that.
You're both coming downtown with me, and you're gonna put that money in the bank.
Boy, I sure could go for 100 tacos right about now.
No.
Yes, this should provide adequate sustenance for the Doctor Who marathon.
You'll feel better knowing your money's - in the hands of professionals.
- "Ook, ook.
" Are you folks ready to go ape? - Mom? - A professional in an ape mask is still a professional.
And you'll find that saving for your future is far more thrilling than any roller coaster.
Really? Wow! I should have started a long time ago.
Mm-hmm.
Now fill out these forms.
I'm sure you'll find them more exciting than a weekend with Batman.
I got their new Thrifty Saver savings account.
instead of the normal 2.
25.
So a year from now I'll have an extra nickel.
I got the account where you get free customized checks.
I chose the Hindenburg flip-book series.
Cool! Hmm.
Checking accounts aren't really for children, Bart.
No, Mom, I can handle it.
Let's see.
Pay to the order of Lisa- One cent, and no cents.
And now the old John Hancock.
- There you go.
- Thank you.
A million dollars? Thanks, Bart.
I owe you one.
That's a post-dated check, remember.
- Don't cash it till the year 10,000.
- Okay.
Excellent.
As soon as the check clears, I'll let you go.
That's it.
No more autographs.
I gotta go.
They're naming a new sandwich after me at my restaurant.
It's okay, Bart.
You can share mine.
Quick! Press against me while the ink's still wet.
No need.
I'm going to get Krusty's autograph the easy way.
If he wants these 25 cents, he'll have to endorse the check by signing it on the back.
Then, when my monthly bank statement comes I'll get the check back, complete with autograph.
No fuss, no muss.
That's a good plan but it won't impress girls like this.
Ew! Lisa's autograph.
Apu's autograph.
Oh, what do you know.
Jimbo's real name is Corky.
And Krusty.
Hey! "Cayman Islands Offshore Holding Corporation"? Krusty was supposed to sign this.
- Take it back and make him sign it.
- Uh, no, no.
Stamping the back of a check is perfectly legal, little boy.
Many people do it to save time.
You see, in this case, instead of writing out his name Krusty has stamped the name of his Cayman Islands Holding Corporation on the- Hmm.
Uh, excuse me a minute.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I can't divulge information about that customer's secret, illegal account.
Oh, crap.
I shouldn't have said he was a customer.
Oh, crap! I shouldn't have said it was a secret.
Oh, crap! I certainly shouldn't have said it was illegal.
It's too hot today.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! I bought this popcorn fair and square.
Sorry.
The bank is- Oh, kid, gosh.
I meant to tell you- Turns out that Krusty is one of the biggest tax cheats in history.
And they nailed him, all thanks to you.
Some might say you're a hero, kid.
Not me, however.
I love Krusty.
Ladies and gentlemen, Krusty the Clown was arrested today for massive tax fraud.
Krusty's years of tax "avoision" would never have- - What the heck is "avoision"? - "Avoision"- It's a crime.
- Look it up.
Would never have- - "Evasion.
" "Evasion.
" I don't say "evasion," I say "avoision.
" Would never have come to light if not for a crafty little boy named Bart Simpson.
Krusty's my hero.
How could I do this to him? It is a tragedy for all us kids but Bart, you can't beat yourself up.
Yeah.
There'll be enough people to do that for me at recess tomorrow.
Oh, I can't go to jail! I got a swanky lifestyle.
I'm used to the best.
Krusty, this is America.
We don't send our celebrities to jail.
We're just going to garnish your salary.
Garnish my celery? Please, Krusty.
No jokes.
Who's joking? Oh, I don't know what you're saying.
It all sounds so crazy to me.
It simply means we'll be taking part of your salary until your debt is repaid.
Say, 75% for 40 years.
- But I don't plan to live that long.
- Oh, better make it 95%.
Oy.
The Internal Revenue Service presents Herschel Krustofski's Clown-Related Entertainment Show.
Hey, hey, kids.
Now that the Feds are calling the shots this show's gotta be a lot more cost-effective.
So we had to cut down on the frills like sets, props, costumes and Sideshow Mel.
But that doesn't mean we can't have fun.
For example, I sure wish somebody would give me a banana cream pie.
Yeah! Uh- I guess we can't afford pies right now.
Well, throw something! Oh, that corner! Um, I'll have four Tax Burgers one "I.
R.
S.
-wich"- withhold the lettuce- three dependent-size sodas and a "FICA-ccino.
" Fill out schedule "B.
" You should receive your burgers in six to eight weeks.
Well, let's see here.
Add schedule "B" to line 53, take away the- Hey, Marge, what were your gambling losses last year? Seven hundred dollars.
They took my money, they wrecked my show they buried a bunch of stinking veterans in my family plot but at least I still got my memories.
Those are locked up safe in my fabulous mansion.
And now, lot number 66, a handmade leather suitcase carried by the Krustofski family upon their arrival at Ellis Island in 1902.
A priceless heirloom and historic piece of"Krustyana.
" - What am I bid? - Forty cents.
I got 40 cents.
Sold, for 40 cents.
Forty cents? My grandpa Zev would turn over in his grave if it wasn't filled with some veteran.
Lot 67, 32 cartons of pornography.
- Ten cents.
- Twelve.
Twelve cents to our phone bidder in Japan.
Any other bids? All I brought is a dime.
I didn't know there'd be pornography.
- Sold, for 12 cents.
- Oh, my beloved pornography.
I can't watch this anymore.
- I'm going to bed.
- How much for Krusty's bed? - Half a buck.
- Sold! - Good night, everybody.
- Good night, Moe.
And now lot number 2,380- Krusty's private plane - the I'm-On-A-Rolla Gay.
- But I love that plane.
I used to fly to Vegas in it with Dean Martin.
One night he looked out the window and the moon hit his eye like a big pizza pie.
We wrote a song about it but it ended up infringing on one he recorded years before.
Hey, Selma, that plane would go great with your new suitcase.
Nah, I just bought it to soak my feet in.
Krusty? Hi.
Is it okay if I sit down here? Aah.
Go ahead, kid.
Knock yourself out.
I'm sorry for all the trouble I've caused you, Krusty but you know, my mom says God never closes a door without opening a window.
No offense, kid, but your mom's a dingbat.
There's no silver lining here.
I was a big cheese- a huge cheese! But now look at me.
I gotta ride the bus like a schnook.
I gotta live in an apartment like an idiot.
I gotta wait in line with nobodies to buy groceries from a failure! It doesn't matter how you live or what you did wrong.
As long as you're on TV, people will respect you.
Respect? Pah! What good is respect without the moola to back it up? Everywhere I go I see teachers in Ferraris- research scientists drinking champagne.
I tried to drink a Coke on the bus and they took away my pass.
That's no life for a famous clown.
Well, if it'll make you feel any better, Krusty you can punch me in the face.
Nah, forget it.
Go home, kid.
Shiva H.
Vishnu! Where is that noise coming from? I must say, I've had a lovely evening, Agnes.
I don't suppose I could come in for a cup of- - Seymour! - Mother.
Superintendent Chalmers! - Skinner! - What I wouldn't give for something to interrupt this awkward moment.
That'll do nicely.
- You gotta hand it to Krusty.
- Yeah.
Even with all his problems, he's still willing to do something unbelievably dangerous just to entertain his fans.
Wow.
Oh, that's my Krusty.
I got a feeling he'll be all right.
Oh, my God! Krusty's shoes! Okay, folks, show's over.
Nothing to see here.
Show's- Oh, my God! A horrible plane crash! Hey, everybody, get a load of this flaming wreckage.
Come on, crowd around.
Crowd around.
Don't be shy.
Crowd around.
Ladies and gentlemen Krusty the Clown is dead.
- I can't believe Krusty's really gone.
- Don't worry, son.
I'm sure he's up in heaven right now laughing it up with all the other celebrities- John Dillinger, Ty Cobb, Joseph Stalin.
I wish I were dead.
We're gathered to mourn the passing of Herschel Schmoeckel Krustofski beloved entertainer and dear friend.
Hello.
I'm Troy McClure.
You might remember me from such show business funerals as "Andre the Giant, We Hardly Knew Ye" and "Shemp Howard: Today We Mourn a Stooge.
" Now, Krusty's closest friend and sidekick Sideshow Mel.
I'll miss you, Krusty- I and all the other Sideshows- except Sideshow Bob.
But, in the midst of our sorrow we can take comfort in the fact that your elevated blood-alcohol level probably helped you burn up quicker.
Since you left us no earthly remains it is my sad duty to unveil this simple memorial.
Next in our cavalcade of celebrity mourners- Bob Newhart.
Uh- See, uh- To tell you the truth, I'm, uh- I was just- I'm just killing time here.
I was waiting for a well, a different- different funeral to start.
I'll handle it.
Bob Newhart, everybody! Oh, uh- Although, you know- Though I started my career several years before Krusty, so you know, I could never really have learned anything directly from him still, I think, in a way- in a very meaningful way- that, uh- that I- uh- uh- all of us- have, uh- have learned from him.
You know, that is, by being, uh, on television for- for- for so many years.
Even- Even though you know, m-many of us, we- we didn't- we didn't watch his show.
Th-Thank you.
Well, that's the funeral, folks.
We'll be sitting shivah at the Friar's Club at 7:00 p.
m.
, and again at 10:00.
You must be over 18 for the 10:00.
It gets a little blue.
And so, Herschel Krustofski is gone, but not forgotten.
Today was the unveiling of the new Krusty stamp.
Postal patrons were asked to choose between two competing designs- one of Krusty's heartwarming smile and one of his fiery death.
By a nearly two-to-one vote, the smiling Krusty was chosen.
Don't let Krusty's death get you down, boy.
People die all the time just like that.
Why, you could wake up dead tomorrow.
Well, good night.
Krusty! Mom! I just saw Krusty! - Yes, dear, in your mind.
- No, on the street.
- On the street in your mind.
- Why won't you believe me? Sweetheart, maybe you just want Krusty to be alive so badly you think you see him everywhere.
I went through the same thing when Lyndon Johnson died.
And these pills will help with the queasiness.
Krusty? Dr.
Hibbert, who was that man? Now, Bart, telling you would violate the patient-doctor privilege just as if I were to tell you that Jasper here has five seconds to live.
- What'd he say? - He said I'm next.
Am I going crazy? I'm seeing Krusty everywhere.
Bart, you're seeing Krusty everywhere because you want to tell him you're sorry for causing his death.
Would it help if I told you you're not responsible - for Krusty's death? - Yes.
Yes, it would.
Well, I can't.
You'll just have to learn to live with your mental problem.
Wait a minute.
All those things I saw- there's a connection.
The truck full of nets and buckets the queasy guy, the lobsters- They all point to one thing.
Follow me.
Arr! I've got some customers.
Call me back, Ishmael.
Ahoy there, minnows.
Ahoy.
Have you seen this man? Arr! That's Handsome Pete.
He dances for nickels.
Pete, ye got some customers.
No, we're looking for this man- Krusty the Clown.
Hmm.
N'arr, n'arr, n'arr.
It's hopeless, Bart.
We've searched up and down these docks from pier one to that Pier 1 by pier 17.
Lisa, look-a signature with stars around it, just like Krusty's.
"Rory B.
Bellows, slip eight.
" Let's go! Not a quarter! Arr! He'll be dancing for hours.
- Are you Rory B.
Bellows? - Yes.
- How about Krusty the Clown? - Sorry.
I don't do impressions.
Well, if you're not Krusty, how come you have the exact same signature as him? I'm Rory Bellows, I tell you and I got a lot of corroborating evidence over here by the throttle! You know, you two could have said something instead of letting me make an ass of myself.
Hey, you got a pacemaker scar, just like Krusty.
And Krusty's superfluous third nipple.
Can't you see I don't want to be Krusty anymore? - That's why I faked my death.
- But we saw your plane crash.
Yeah, but I wasn't in it.
Just before I hit the mountain, I jumped out of the plane into a carefully placed net.
Now that we've blown your cover, I guess you gotta come back and do your show again.
Or kill us.
I won't be coming back, kids.
I got a sweet life here.
The sea air is clearing my lungs the sun is toasting my pale skin a healthy brown and most important, I learned that I don't need money to be happy.
All that high living just distracted me from my true calling in life- salvaging sunken barges for scrap iron.
Sorry, kids.
There's nothing left for me on dry land anymore.
But Krusty, what about all the kids who depend on you to brighten up their afternoons? - Are you gonna turn your back on them? - Yes! Come on, Lise.
Krusty doesn't want our attention anymore.
Let's go worship somebody who has the guts to be a celebrity.
Yeah.
Krusty doesn't want to be a clown.
He's happy just being another blue-collar bozo.
Meh! Krusty's tired of having phonies around pretending to be his friends.
I'm sure he'll find plenty of people who'll like him for who he is.
Uh, it could happen.
Aw, who needs friends? The incessant beep of the global positioning system is all the companionship I need.
Tell me where you are now, you bastard! All right, I admit it.
I miss the phonies.
That's all I miss- that and ShirleyJones's and Marty Ingels's New Year's Eve party.
What about that great feeling you get from knowing you're better than regular people? What about being an illiterate TV clown who's still more respected than all the scientists doctors and educators in the country put together? Yeah! I'm not gonna let those guys hog all the respect while I'm out here on some stinkin' tub.
That's just what those eggheads want.
Well, forget it, poindexter, 'cause Krusty's back in town! Yea! So, Krusty, what are you gonna do about your tax problem? Don't sweat it.
The life of Rory B.
Bellows is insured for a surprisingly large amount.
Shh!
